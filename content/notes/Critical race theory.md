Critical race theory (CRT) is a cross-disciplinary examination of how laws, social and political movements, and media shape, and are shaped by, social conceptions of race and ethnicity.

CRT scholars view race as a social construct with no biological basis. They argue that racism and disparate racial outcomes are the result of complex, changing, and often subtle social and institutional dynamics, rather than explicit and intentional prejudices of individuals. CRT scholars argue that the social and legal construction of race advances the interests of white people at the expense of people of color, and that the liberal notion of U.S. law as "neutral" plays a significant role in maintaining a racially unjust social order, where formally color-blind laws continue to have racially discriminatory outcomes.

CRT is not a monolithic ideology, and there is a wide range of views within the CRT movement. However, some of the core tenets of CRT include:

- The belief that racism is not simply the product of individual prejudice, but is also embedded in legal systems and policies.
- The examination of how race and racism intersect with other forms of oppression, such as sexism, classism, and homophobia.
- The use of storytelling and counter-narratives to challenge dominant understandings of race and racism.
- The commitment to social justice and the transformation of a racist society.

CRT has been the subject of much debate and controversy in recent years. Some critics have accused CRT of being racist itself, arguing that it teaches that all white people are racist and that all people of color are victims of racism. Others have argued that CRT is too divisive and that it promotes a victim mentality.

However, CRT's supporters argue that it is a necessary tool for understanding and addressing racism in the United States. They argue that CRT provides a framework for understanding how racism operates in society, and that it can help to challenge and dismantle racist systems and institutions.

Some fallacies and misunderstandings surrounding CRT include:

- The belief that CRT teaches that all white people are racist. CRT does not teach that all white people are racist. However, it does argue that racism is a systemic problem that benefits white people at the expense of people of color.
- The belief that CRT is too divisive. CRT can be a divisive topic, but it is important to remember that it is a complex issue with no easy answers. CRT can help to start important conversations about race and racism, and it can help to build understanding and solidarity across racial lines.
- The belief that CRT is a form of identity politics. CRT is not a form of identity politics. However, it does argue that race is a social construct that has important implications for people's lives. CRT can help to people understand their own racial identity and how it intersects with other forms of identity, such as class, gender, and sexuality.

Here are some examples where people misuse the term "critical race theory":

- People who use the term to refer to any discussion of race or racism.
- People who use the term to attack or dismiss any attempt to address racism.
- People who use the term to promote a false narrative about CRT.
