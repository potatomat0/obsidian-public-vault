The **Ludlow Massacre** was a [mass killing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_killing "Mass killing") perpetrated by anti-striker militia during the [Colorado Coalfield War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Coalfield_War "Colorado Coalfield War"). Soldiers from the [Colorado National Guard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_National_Guard "Colorado National Guard") and private guards employed by [Colorado Fuel and Iron Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Fuel_and_Iron_Company "Colorado Fuel and Iron Company") (CF&I) attacked a tent colony of roughly 1,200 striking [coal miners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_miner "Coal miner") and their families in [Ludlow, Colorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludlow,_Colorado "Ludlow, Colorado"), on April 20, 1914. Approximately 21 people, including miners' wives and children, were killed. [John D. Rockefeller Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._Rockefeller_Jr. "John D. Rockefeller Jr."), a part-owner of CF&I who had recently appeared before a [United States congressional hearing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_congressional_hearing "United States congressional hearing") on the strikes, was widely blamed for having orchestrated the massacre.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludlow_Massacre#cite_note-DU-6)[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludlow_Massacre#cite_note-:2-7)

The massacre was the seminal event of the [1913–1914 Colorado Coalfield War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Coalfield_War "Colorado Coalfield War"), which began with a general [United Mine Workers of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Mine_Workers_of_America "United Mine Workers of America") strike against poor labor conditions in CF&I's southern Colorado coal mines.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludlow_Massacre#cite_note-8) The strike was organized by miners working for the [Rocky Mountain Fuel Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountain_Fuel_Company "Rocky Mountain Fuel Company") and [Victor-American Fuel Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor-American_Fuel_Company "Victor-American Fuel Company"). Ludlow was the deadliest single incident during the Colorado Coalfield War and spurred a ten-day period of heightened violence throughout Colorado. In retaliation for the massacre at Ludlow, bands of armed miners attacked dozens of anti-union establishments, destroying property and engaging in several skirmishes with the Colorado National Guard along a 225-mile (362 km) front from [Trinidad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad,_Colorado "Trinidad, Colorado") to [Louisville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Colorado "Louisville, Colorado").[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludlow_Massacre#cite_note-DU-6) From the strike's beginning in September 1913 to intervention by federal soldiers under [President](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States "President of the United States") [Woodrow Wilson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson "Woodrow Wilson")'s orders on April 29, 1914, an estimated 69 to 199 people were killed during the strike. Historian Thomas G. Andrews declared it the "deadliest strike in the history of the United States."[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludlow_Massacre#cite_note-Andrews2010-2): 1 

The Ludlow Massacre was a watershed moment in American labor relations. Socialist historian [Howard Zinn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Zinn "Howard Zinn") described it as "the culminating act of perhaps the most violent struggle between corporate power and laboring men in American history".[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludlow_Massacre#cite_note-9) Congress responded to public outrage by directing the [House Committee on Mines and Mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Mines_and_Mining "United States House Committee on Mines and Mining") to investigate the events.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludlow_Massacre#cite_note-10) Its report, published in 1915, was influential in promoting [child labor laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_labor_laws_in_the_United_States "Child labor laws in the United States") and an eight-hour work day. The Ludlow townsite and the adjacent location of the tent colony, 18 miles (29 km) northwest of [Trinidad, Colorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinidad,_Colorado "Trinidad, Colorado"), is now a [ghost town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_town "Ghost town"). The massacre site is owned by the United Mine Workers of America, which erected a granite [monument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludlow_Monument "Ludlow Monument") in memory of those who died that day.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludlow_Massacre#cite_note-McPhee-11) The [Ludlow tent colony site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludlow_Tent_Colony_Site "Ludlow Tent Colony Site") was designated a [National Historic Landmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Historic_Landmark "National Historic Landmark") on January 16, 2009, and dedicated on June 28, 2009.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludlow_Massacre#cite_note-McPhee-11) Subsequent investigations immediately following the massacre and modern [archeological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archeology "Archeology") efforts largely support some of the strikers' accounts of the event.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludlow_Massacre#cite_note-12)
