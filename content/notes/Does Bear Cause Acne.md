While there is no direct link between drinking alcohol and developing acne, excess alcohol intake may aggravate acne in adults. Beer is inflammatory and dehydrating, and when skin is dry, oil glands produce more oil. Most beer is loaded with carbs, which can trigger a cascade of hormones that cause acne. A single can of regular beer has over 12g of carbs on average. [While light beer has about half the carbs, it still doesn’t escape the other drawbacks of beer and acne](https://www.acneaction.ca/can-beer-cause-acne/)[1](https://www.acneaction.ca/can-beer-cause-acne/).

It’s important to note that acne is caused by bacteria, inflammation, and clogged pores. Certain lifestyle habits can make you more vulnerable to developing acne, especially if you have acne-prone skin. Drinking alcohol doesn’t cause acne. It also doesn’t directly worsen the condition. [But it can affect certain bodily systems, such as your hormone levels, that influence acne development](https://www.healthline.com/health/beauty-skin-care/does-alcohol-cause-acne)[2](https://www.healthline.com/health/beauty-skin-care/does-alcohol-cause-acne).

## Alcohol and your immune system

Your immune system is a powerful force in keeping harmful bacteria and viruses at bay. It’s made up of cytokines and other protective cells that keep you healthy.

Alcohol can [decreaseTrusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4590613/) the number of protective cells in the body, and even destroy them. This may make your body more susceptible to infections.

Take _Propionibacterium acnes_ (_P. acnes_) bacteria, for example. These bacteria are known to cause [cysts and pustules](https://www.healthline.com/health/beauty-skin-care/types-of-acne). Although _P. acnes_ can infect your skin at any time, you may be more susceptible when your immune system is suppressed.

Researchers haven’t established a direct link between alcohol and _P. acnes_. But the relationship between your immune system, bacteria, and alcohol is worth considering.

## Alcohol and your hormones

Alcohol has wide-ranging effects on your [hormone levels](https://www.healthline.com/health/beauty-skin-care/hormonal-acne). While it’s known that alcohol can [lowerTrusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3767933/) testosterone levels in men, a [small studyTrusted Source](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1530-0277.2003.tb04405.x/abstract) found that small doses of alcohol could increase testosterone levels in men.

Another [small studyTrusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10684783) found that alcohol can increase testosterone levels in women. It can also [increaseTrusted Source](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/102/4/933/4564526) estradiol levels in women, too. [Estradiol](https://www.healthline.com/health/estradiol-test) is a form of estrogen.

Increased hormone levels [can stimulate](https://www.aad.org/media/news-releases/hormonal-factors-key-to-understanding-acne-in-women) your oil glands. Increased oil, or sebum, production can clog your pores and result in a breakout.

More research is needed to truly understand the relationship between alcohol and hormonal acne.
