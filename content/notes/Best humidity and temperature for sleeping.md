## **Best humidity level for your home and bedroom**

Relative humidity (RH) is a standard way to measure humidity. The best way to measure room humidity is with the use of a hygrometer. Here is the way to [**measure relative humidity level**](https://www.wikihow.com/Calculate-Humidity) in your home.

If there is a natural wind or a breeze in a high humidity climate, even if the temperature is not particularly low, the apparent temperature is often lower than the actual temperature. For example, the mobile device displays a temperature of 8 degrees and the humidity is 81%, but the apparent temperature is actually only 3 degrees. In this case,  you need to stay warm.

Research shows that 40% ~ 60% humidity is ideal for indoors. Most experts agree that going above 60% is too humid for the human lungs to cope with. During winter times, it is usually difficult to keep the air this moist. Most people do keep their room humidity at around 40% - 50% and that's usually the average comfort zone.

According to experts, the ideal room humidity level for better sleep is between 30% ~ 50%. This means being in an environment that is too dry, or has too much moisture can impact the quality of our sleep.

## **Best temperature for sleeping in Celsius**

The best temperature for sleeping is around **16~18 degrees celsius (60.8~64.4°F)**. However, 18.5°C ~ 20.5°C is an ideal house temperature range for your room. Everyone's sense is a bit different and you should choose a temperature that makes you most comfortable. Keeping the temperature a bit higher also saves your home's electricity!

This is the normal temperature our circadian rhythm (the 24 hour process or cycle our body physically goes through) in order to get to sleep. But plenty of factors can affect this: our environment, our physical activity before rest, and even the food we eat can all play a role in how easily or how hard it is for us to rest.
