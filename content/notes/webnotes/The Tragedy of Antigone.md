Antigone is a tragedy by Sophocles, written around 442 BCE. The play is set in the ancient Greek city of Thebes, after the civil war in which the two sons of Oedipus, Eteocles and Polyneices, killed each other. The new king of Thebes, Creon, orders that Polyneices' body be left unburied, as punishment for his treason. However, Antigone, Polyneices' sister, believes that it is her duty to bury her brother, regardless of the law. She defies Creon's order and buries Polyneices herself.

Creon is furious when he discovers that Antigone has disobeyed him. He has her arrested and sentenced to death. Antigone's sister, Ismene, tries to take the blame for Antigone's actions, but Antigone refuses to let her.

Haemon, Creon's son and Antigone's fianc√©, begs his father to spare Antigone's life. However, Creon is adamant that Antigone must be punished. He even threatens to kill Haemon if he does not agree with him.

In the end, Creon's stubbornness leads to the deaths of Antigone, Haemon, and his own wife, Eurydice. Creon is left alone and full of regret.
