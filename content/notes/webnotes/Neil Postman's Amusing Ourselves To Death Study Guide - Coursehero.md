# Overview
### At a Glance

In the late 1930s and early 1940s, television seemed like a positive, even magical development in the United States. Viewers could access global news and experience spectacular entertainment. But soon every aspect of culture, including education and religion, faced pressure to turn into show business. Media theorist Neil Postman's 1985 critique suggests television is an enemy, not a friend, to serious public discourse. He compares late 20th-century America to the dystopia in British writer Aldous Huxley's (1894–1963) _Brave New World_, where citizens are so absorbed by fascinating technologies, they do not notice their freedom disappearing. _Amusing Ourselves to Death_ urges readers to take all forms of media seriously, revealing the media's ability to transform politics, education, culture, and history.

### About the Title

The title contrasts the pleasurable process of amusement with the serious consequence of death. The contrast is meant to startle readers. The book argues that when a culture replaces information with entertainment, cultural history and individual autonomy disappear.

The subtitle indicates public discussion or discourse has declined since television promoted "show business" in all areas of life. The phrase "Age of Show Business" reflects Postman's theory that different communication tools, such as print and television, shape historical ages or eras.

# Main Ideas

## Media Shapes Perceptions of Truth

Humans are surrounded by various forms of communication, and these modes are more influential than people may realize. Postman believes that each form of media comes with its own epistemology, or theory of knowledge. A society's media-metaphor—the way each source of media symbolizes a larger, more significant concept—will inform their methods of "truth-telling." Specifically, Postman believes media defines two versions of truth: what people believe is accurate or trustworthy and what they believe is intelligent or wise.

Postman believes each form of media has a bias toward a certain form of cognition—seeing, hearing, or reading, for instance—depending on the senses people use to access the medium. If people use a visual medium most consistently, they'll believe what they see. If they use an auditory medium most consistently, they'll believe what they hear.

Different cultures value spoken words, written words, and images as accurate vessels for truth. Chapter 2 offers the story of a Western university student who discovered that academic culture trusted the written word over the spoken word. This culture prized research and the ability to double-check facts. While anyone could look up and verify a written statement, they could not do the same with the spoken word. Ancient Greeks trusted the logical progression of written, persuasive arguments. They did not believe an argument if it didn't follow an order they could understand. Television, an image-based medium requiring performance, suggests information is trustworthy only if viewers believe and like the messenger. Postman mentions the saying "seeing is believing" as a new maxim for the television age.

Media bias also informs ideas of intelligence and wisdom. An oral culture with no written law might consider wisdom the ability to memorize and apply proverbs. A print-based culture may value the skills of reading and synthesizing written information. In the early colonial United States, the leaders had been trained at print-based universities and were avid readers. The rest of the community developed reading skills for communication and education. As a result the "linear, analytical structure of print ... [and] expository prose" became models for wisdom. Authors and rhetorical thinkers earned respect.

Education methods also define what a culture considers intelligent, and media shapes education. Once teaching became more image-based after the prominence of television, Postman believes students learned fewer analytical skills and more fragmented, collected facts. In Chapter 10 he describes a popular audio-visual education project designed to teach students through adventure and storytelling, prizing short-term entertainment over long-term thinking.

## Print-Based Discourse versus Image-Based Discourse

When the technology to reproduce images became available in the 19th century, people started seeing photographs all around them. Postman and American historian Daniel Boorstin call this development the "graphic revolution." The word _revolution_ suggests a radical, permanent change. A discourse based on images instead of words teaches different ways to organize the world. It also promotes different approaches to the past and the present.

Words promote a linear, logical, and abstract world, while images reveal a more emotion-driven, fragmented, and concrete world. When someone speaks or writes words, "an idea, a fact, a claim is the inevitable result." Readers and listeners must think logically to decipher this claim. Even naming something with words is "an act of thinking," Postman says. Political candidates use rhetorical techniques such as metaphor and contradiction to talk to a print-based audience.

But viewers can't reason or argue with a photograph the way they might with written text. They see a concrete object; they don't encounter an abstract idea. And when photographs and images are presented one after another without continuity or verbal explanation, the world appears recreated "as a series of idiosyncratic events." The events have nothing to do with one another, offering no sense of logical progression. When advertisements are print-based, they appeal to a buyer's logical understanding by presenting information about the product for sale. Image-based advertisements, including television commercials, can use the quicker and more emotionally resonant discourse of pictures. They evoke strong feelings by giving consumers a lifestyle fantasy. Political candidates similarly adapt their campaigns to focus on positive imagery.

Words provide a connection to the past, while images imply a continuous present tense. "A book is an attempt to make thought permanent," Postman writes in Chapter 5, referring to the written word's ability to stretch a conversation across time. When someone reads a book written many years before they were born, they can access the writer's thoughts. The structure of written sentences also implies order. A sentence needs to be organized so a reader can interpret what it's trying to say. It has a beginning, middle, and end.

An image has no such requirements. A viewer doesn't need to compare verb tenses or think about cause and effect—a viewer only needs to think in the present tense. The paraded images viewers observe through "speeded-up electronic media" replace one another quickly, not slowing down to connect one image to the next. This media approach, Postman argues, could lead to viewers forgetting the importance of history. Entertainment requires constant novelty, while memory requires returning to previous events. And when people are deprived of their history, they lose something important about themselves. Without a cohesive memory of the past, they can't move forward into an empowering future.

## The Danger of Serious Topics as Entertainment

Television is "most dangerous when its aspirations are high," according to Postman, who worries the media form diminishes serious subject matter. Any material adapted for television is "transformed from what it was to something else." The image-centered media insists television shows keep viewers intrigued and gratified at all costs. These priorities affect how people find information through local and global news, as well as how they find meaning and wisdom through cultural institutions.

Television news presents a world Postman compares to the game of peek-a-boo. Once viewers see events, the events disappear with little explanation or interpretation. Other events soon take their place. To Postman this presentation of facts leaves the viewer feeling helpless. The viewer observes tragedies but can do nothing about them.

Television models the world for its viewers, and a world full of scattered images does not make much sense. The quick succession of images also implies none of them are serious enough for extended attention. The cheery commercials interrupting television news programs throw real-world events out of context. "We are urged by the newscasters to 'join them tomorrow.' What for?" Postman asks in Chapter 6, wondering what valuable, actionable information a viewer can take from televised events.

When television attempts to provide religious rituals or educational material, it ignores the culturally important aspects of both faith and education. In Chapter 8 Postman argues religion is best experienced in a dedicated physical space, which cultivates the "aura of mystery and symbolic otherworldliness" required for contemplation. Many religious practices cultivate discipline, tradition, and a focus beyond the self. Television, however, promises instant gratification. When evangelists are on television, they perform more than they preach. They may even offer material rewards to keep viewers interested, knowing the success of their show relies on getting people to watch no matter what. Similarly, educational programs do not demand the concentration and patience a classroom requires from a student. Young people encounter a television show as passive watchers, not as active learners. When "the contentment, not the growth, of the learner is paramount," Postman thinks both students and teachers lose.

## Communication Tools Impact Human History and Progress

Communication methods inform essential aspects of human identity. People describe themselves, interact with others, and learn about the world through their media. These media can even shape historical eras. Postman demonstrates how three kinds of communication tools transformed the Western world: the alphabet, typography or the printed word, and television.

The alphabet made language permanent for the first time. Plato, the Greek philosopher who lived during the fourth and fifth centuries BCE, worried about the impact unchangeable written characters would have on thinking and learning. The ability to write brought the past into the present, changing concepts of time. It let writers communicate with people they would never see, changing notions of audience. And it made way for the emerging disciplines of science, logic, and history.

The printing press created an era in which people valued the skills reading required: logic, reason, and sequential thought. Its 15th-century invention and increased popularity paved the way for the European Enlightenment, or "age of reason," a cultural movement emphasizing rationality and human accomplishments. Chapter 2 describes how typography, or print, promoted individuality over community and science over religion. Prose replaced poetry as the dominant form of written discourse, changing language and thought. English colonizers brought the Enlightenment mindset to early America, cultivating a print-based country.

Television similarly "imposes a way of life, a set of relations among people and ideas" where images, not words, shape reality. For instance, the meaning of "knowing" a fact changed in the television era. People didn't need to read or analyze in order to feel they knew something. They only needed to see an image. Television transformed the way Americans purchased products, selected government leaders, and the way they imagine the rest of the world. Television also has a different concept of audience or the "public" than printed news does. While newspapers assume readers can think and interpret for themselves, television does most of the work for its viewers. As a result, viewers may grow complacent and lose capacities for critical thought. Though Postman focuses his discussion on the United States, he implies other Western and worldwide countries may develop similar habits.

# Context

## Media Theorists Who Influenced _Amusing Ourselves to Death_

[Neil Postman](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/author/) was a media theorist, or someone who studies society's relationship to media. The term _media_ can refer to print, audio, video, images, or any other method of communication designed to reach a large number of people. A constantly evolving field, media theory combines psychology, sociology, information technology, history, and other topics. In _Amusing Ourselves to Death_, Postman primarily discusses the media of print and television. However, his interests lie in how media transforms the people who use it. How do different mediums of communication shape a society's basic beliefs and values? How much can media affect a society's rituals, political participation, power hierarchies, definitions of freedom and responsibility, and sense of community?

Postman considered media an environment of its own. He borrowed the term _media ecology_ from [Marshall McLuhan](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/key-figure-analysis/#Marshall_McLuhan) (1911–80), a prominent Canadian media theorist who influenced Postman's work. The word _ecology_ comes from biological science. To Postman, media affects human cultures the same way natural surroundings affect biological environments. Media creates a culture's unspoken expectations for behavior by "[structuring] what we can see and say and therefore, do," Postman wrote. But most participants in a culture don't realize media has such a strong influence.

Media theorists acknowledged the impact of their communication tools even before television became prominent. Canadian political economist Harold Adams Innis (1894–1952) believed that different communication technologies encouraged different forms of power. Innis, like Postman, thought each new medium came with its own bias or preference for some information over others—and for some beliefs over others. He also argued that a culture's stability depended on its media.

McLuhan decided to study media when he felt alienated from his students at the University of Wisconsin. Though the students were only 5 or 10 years younger than he was, they seemed separated from him by a generation gap. This experience made McLuhan think about how people learn and how media environments dictate their learning.

While Postman focuses on how media use affects groups and cultures, McLuhan studied how media affects individual bodies and minds. Media use, McLuhan believed, could eventually alter the structure of the brain. But he knew media leads to larger structural changes in society—changes people might not fully understand until generations have passed. Other nonmedia inventions had similar effects. The railroad, for instance, didn't just provide a new form of transportation. It altered cities and changed American attitudes toward work and leisure. In _Amusing Ourselves to Death_, Postman, inspired by McLuhan, discusses how typography, or the printed word, reshaped Western society's politics, social life, and religious values for centuries.

## Huxley and Orwell

Postman's foreword contrasts two British novels that present radically different visions of a society gone wrong. Each novel is considered a dystopia, or imaginary environment dominated by injustice and suffering. _1984_ by [George Orwell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/key-figure-analysis/#George_Orwell) (1903–50) predicts a chilling totalitarian state. _Brave New World_ by [Aldous Huxley](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/key-figure-analysis/#Aldous_Huxley) (1894–1963) anticipates a culture where most residents are drugged and numb by entertainment. The world created by Orwell frightened many readers and became a cultural symbol for government control. But Postman's thesis argues that the vision of Huxley, not that of Orwell, is coming true in the late 20th-century United States.

Orwell's book was published in 1949 during the Cold War (c. 1945–91), a decades-long standoff between the democratic United States and the communist Soviet Union. World War II (1939–45) had dominated the first half of the decade, and the crimes of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler (1889–1945) still haunted readers' minds. Readers were also concerned about the rise of Soviet tyrant Joseph Stalin (c. 1878–1953). Western governments such as the United States and England feared communist governments would gain greater influence in the world. These communist governments often used totalitarian rule, in which dictators demanded absolute obedience and curtailed personal freedom.

_1984_ shows a dramatic totalitarian state in fictional Oceania. It includes a drab, colorless version of a future London, England, possibly inspired by the post–World War II London where Orwell lived. In Oceania a powerful Party and its all-seeing leader, Big Brother, control citizens' thoughts with the Thought Police. The Party speaks to citizens through propaganda, or misleading information used to promote a political cause. It invents its own language, Newspeak, which limits word variety so speakers will conform to a single mindset. Opposing opinions are censored, and dissenters are punished.

_Brave New World_ offers a dystopia in which residents seem happier. In Huxley's fictional World State, leaders sort citizens into different social groups and give them mind-numbing drugs called soma so they'll accept their fates. The drugs dampen any emotions except mild, pleasant ones. The World State encourages people to shop and consume as much as possible. Citizens are surrounded by advertising jingles. They enjoy the virtual reality "feelies"—movies with tactile effects—and enjoy other sophisticated entertainment technologies.

_Brave New World_ does have a darker side. Huxley wrote the novel in 1931, an era when talking pictures and other inventions made Westerners enthusiastic about new technologies. In Huxley's view, people were starting to trust technology too much. _Brave New World_ implies technology can be taken too far if not used responsibly. It shows a society dominated by genetic engineering and consumerism, where people are commodities instead of individuals.

Residents of the World State also lose their memory of history and its consequences. The novel takes place after a world war the citizens are trained to forget. Henry Ford, an American businessman and founder of the Ford automobile empire, is a hero in _Brave New World_. The book quotes Ford's saying that "history is bunk." Huxley's dystopia only cares about moving forward with exciting innovations. The mass-produced automobiles that Ford's company created were an example of the industrialization and materialism Huxley feared.

While people in Orwell's dystopia protest their fate, most people in Huxley's dystopia love their lives. Leaders drug citizens to keep them placid and content, discouraging critical thinking and memory. Language is reduced to brief catchphrases, not because the government is spreading propaganda but because residents have short attention spans. No one seems to suffer; they're given exactly what they think they want. But just like the victims of _1984_, _Brave New World_'s characters have no freedom of choice. They don't think independently, and they lack a sense of who they are as a culture. Their leaders control them by offering pleasures.

Huxley, like Postman, felt the dystopia of _Brave New World_ would come true in Western societies before the dystopia of _1984_ would. When _1984_ was published, Huxley told Orwell a government could control citizens without using violence or censorship. All the government had to do was keep people happy, and they would never know their freedom was gone. Postman similarly fears new technologies will lead people to "love their oppression."

## Reception and Ongoing Relevance

_Amusing Ourselves to Death_ focuses on the impact of a particular technology: television. Neil Postman blames television's combination of "image and instancy" for the decline of American public discourse into superficial immaturity. His critique remains relevant as technology evolves. The term _media_ has expanded since 1985 to include not only wide-ranging use of the Internet to instantly access TV shows and movies, but also self-publicizing through Facebook and Twitter, cross-linking with gaming, news, text messaging, and a plethora of apps on cell phones. Many of his observations relate to human nature itself. He notices people's capacity for distraction and diversion, their desire to experience positive emotions, and their unquestioning trust in new inventions. He's also wary of any kind of entertainment used as a tool to sway public opinion. When topics such as politics, religion, history, and education turn exclusively into amusement, Postman fears the meaning of these topics will be lost.

Similarly, Postman fears any new communication tool will control its users unless the users understand the tool's impact. The computer was the emerging technology when _Amusing Ourselves to Death_ was published in 1985. Postman urges readers to apply the book's "questions about the psychic, political and social effects of information" to computers as well as television. He encourages readers to look for historical patterns to make sense of future media landscapes he cannot predict. He also raises larger points, not specific to television, about the power of communication systems to shape societies.

Writers since Postman have pointed out examples of his predictions coming true. Postman's son, the author Andrew Postman, observes in a 2017 column that American adults spend about 74 hours per week looking at screens. This amount of time indicates what Postman might call a change in the media landscape. Adults in the 21st century absorb local, national, and global news and opinions—information likely to affect the way they live their lives—through videos and image-heavy social media posts. Screens shape their reality.

Each new medium comes with different expectations of its content creators and audiences. Writer Ed McMenamin connects Postman's theories to the rise of social media in the early 21st century. Building on Postman's belief that every form of media has a bias, McMenamin points out "social media's unique set of biases towards viralability, shareability, and personal-brand building." Just as television favors images keeping viewers intrigued, social media favors images users are likely to share and share again.

Postman proposes television, like print and other communication tools, comes with its own epistemology, or way of knowing about the world. He calls television "the background radiation of the social and intellectual universe" in Chapter 5, comparing the medium to a biological force saturating the environment. Writers since Postman have discussed the influence of media on users' experiences of reality itself. Author Jane McGonigal's 2011 book _Reality Is Broken: Why Games Make Us Better and How They Can Change the World_ suggests reality is a constructed structure capable of change.

#  Key Figure Analysis

## George Orwell

George Orwell's novel _1984_ describes a state where the leaders demand absolute obedience. The government lies to its citizens and monitors every aspect of their lives. The novel became a famous example of totalitarianism, or a government permitting no individual freedom. Postman uses _1984_ as an example of a future Americans have learned to fear, particularly because of its resemblance to 20th-century totalitarian governments in Germany and the Soviet Union. He argues the predictions of _1984_ are unlikely to come true in the United States.

## Aldous Huxley

Aldous Huxley wrote _Brave New World_ in part as a warning against overreliance on technology. Citizens in the novel worship industrialist Henry Ford. Because they're so easily entranced by technological devices, they have forgotten how to think for themselves. They surrender control without realizing it. Postman uses _Brave New World_ as an example of a dystopian vision that may come true in the United States. He believes television resembles the futuristic technologies in Huxley's novel—devices designed to distract, amuse, and erase critical thinking.

## Marshall McLuhan

Postman incorporates Marshall McLuhan's ideas throughout his work, particularly as a starting point for Chapter 1. In this chapter, Postman agrees with McLuhan that communication systems reveal deep truths about a culture. But Postman adapts "the medium is the message" to describe media as a metaphor—a symbolic suggestion of something greater than what it is. In Chapter 10 Postman recommends readers consult McLuhan for a fuller understanding of how electronics impact communication.

## Karl Marx

Like Karl Marx, Postman is interested in how societies progress from one state to another. At the end of Chapter 4, Postman refers to Marx's belief that epic poems could never come from print-based civilizations. Postman agrees with Marx's belief that the new form of print made the old content of epic poetry disappear, as epics are typically spoken or sung before they're written down. Marxist thought also comes into play in Chapter 11. Postman thinks many Americans share the Marxist belief that culture is constantly advancing because of changing forces in the material, physical world. Americans believe new technology leads to positive progress, a view Postman considers Marxist.

## Summary

### Foreword

[Neil Postman](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/author/) contrasts two famous British dystopian novels: English novelist [George Orwell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/key-figure-analysis/#George_Orwell)'s (1903–50) _1984_ and English novelist [Aldous Huxley](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/key-figure-analysis/#Aldous_Huxley)'s (1894–1963) _Brave New World_. Postman ruminates on Americans' relief over Orwell's predictions of a heavily oppressive government not coming true in the year 1984. However, he reminds readers about Huxley's earlier and lesser-known prophesies of oppression created by entertainment and other pleasures, to which Postman introduces his thesis "Huxley, not Orwell, was right."

### Part 1, Chapter 1|The Medium Is the Metaphor

Postman describes technology and other media as metaphors, or symbols for larger, abstract concepts. He also examines how the form of media can influence the quality of a culture.

### Part 1, Chapter 2|Media as Epistemology

In this chapter Postman explains how forms of media and communication determine a culture's beliefs about truth and intelligence. Postman will focus on television and media as they relate to _epistemology_, a branch of philosophy studying the origins and nature of human knowledge. Specifically, he will explore how different forms of media provide different definitions of truth.

### Part 1, Chapter 3|Typographic America

Postman's focus in this chapter is how 18th- and 19th-century America's reliance on the printed written word shaped the country's growth, identity, and values.

### Part 1, Chapter 4|The Typographic Mind

This chapter further analyzes how print shaped the cultural institutions and dialogues of 17th- to 19th-century America. It focuses on the analytical thought process print media encourages. Postman discusses how written communication shapes the way people think and interact. He connects the rise of American print culture to the Enlightenment, or the age of reason, a European cultural movement emphasizing science, education, and knowledge. Print encouraged an analytical thought process in all areas of life, including religion, law, and advertising.

### Part 1, Chapter 5|The Peek-a-Boo World

The telegraph and photograph introduced rapid information transmission and mass-produced images to American discourse. Postman discusses how these new media impacted people's views of the world around them.

### Part 2, Chapter 6|The Age of Show Business

Television's dominance led to shifting cultural priorities. This chapter provides an overview of American institutions' increased focus on entertainment in the late 20th century.

Postman shares his belief that television attacks literate culture and encourages readers to ask themselves what television is, what conversations television allows, and what culture it shapes. To clarify his discussion of television as a medium, Postman distinguishes between technology—a physical device or a machine—and a medium—the use for the device and the "social and intellectual environment" the device creates. He says television becomes a medium when it affects the public dialogue

### Part 2, Chapter 7|"Now ... This."

In this chapter Postman proposes the fragmented, disorganized, and brief nature of television news programs harms viewers' ability to understand the world. He breaks down the phrase "now ... this" into two events that do not relate to each other in any way and argues this disjointed arrangement creates a world with "no order or meaning ... not to be taken seriously."

He goes on to explain that this random, scattered presentation of facts was introduced by the combination of the telegraph and photograph. But television perfected the "'Now ... this' worldview." Almost every half hour of television is a different event. Viewers don't have to put the information in context or consider its value to their lives.

### Part 2, Chapter 8|Shuffle Off to Bethlehem

This chapter shows how televised religious services change faith-based rituals into entertainment. Postman discusses why he feels the translation of worship from a service to a television screen doesn't work. He disagrees with prominent evangelists who believe television is an ideal medium to convert followers. He argues that television can't provide a genuine religious experience because programs lack the consecrated and sacred physical space required for a religious service and viewers who are used to seeing secular advertisements and profanity on television may find it hard to absorb a thoughtful, faith-based message from the same medium.

### Part 2, Chapter 9|Reach Out and Elect Someone

Political commercials changed the way Americans elect their representatives. Postman analyzes how commercials are designed to impact viewers and how this impact affects the political process. He focuses on the slogan "Reach Out and Touch Someone" from Bell advertisements, whose promises of intimacy and family togetherness across long distances appeal to emotional desires in the consumer instead of giving information about the company or product. He likens this strategy to that of political commercials. Voters are less likely to select candidates whose policies will improve their lives. They pick candidates whose charm and warmth make them feel good about themselves.

### Part 2, Chapter 10|Teaching as an Amusing Activity

This chapter argues against the use of television as a central education tool. Postman claims television cannot provide the skills required for lasting learning and growth. He uses _Sesame Street_ as an example of educational programming where fun is the goal, not teaching. He goes on to argue that because many young people watch television, the medium has inevitably shaped how children learn. Young viewers have absorbed the idea that "teaching and entertainment are inseparable." This negates the beliefs of educational philosophers—they think learning should challenge the student, encourage group work, and nurture the difficult process of critical thinking.

### Part 2, Chapter 11|The Huxleyan Warning

Postman's conclusion offers ways for readers to critically examine their use of television and media. It also advocates for schools to teach students about media biases and dangers.

## Summary

The foreword contrasts two famous British dystopian novels: [George Orwell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/key-figure-analysis/#George_Orwell)'s (1903–50) _1984_ (1949) and [Aldous Huxley](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/key-figure-analysis/#Aldous_Huxley)'s (1894–1963) _Brave New World_ (1932). Orwell's _1984_ imagines a dark totalitarian state with thought control, where a ruler called Big Brother watches citizens' every move. _Brave New World_ presents a culture driven by passive entertainment, where people enjoy themselves and don't live in fear. [Neil Postman](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/author/) introduces the argument he will make in _Amusing Ourselves to Death_: Huxley's vision of the future is closer to the truth than Orwell's vision. He also argues that Huxley's dystopia has equally tragic consequences for critical thinking and democratic freedom.

The visions in _1984_ initially seemed terrifying to American readers. Eventually, the year 1984 came and went, and Orwell's dystopia did not come true in the United States. Americans were relieved and proud of their liberal democracy. However, what Americans forgot—and Postman recalled—was the threat of Huxley's vision: people do not need an outside authority to oppress them. Instead, they will "come to love their oppression" since it comes in the pleasurable form of new technologies.

For instance, Orwell feared authorities would ban books. Huxley, on the other hand, feared people would no longer want to read. Governments would not conceal truth; instead, "a sea of irrelevance" would make accurate information hard to find. Culture would not be dominated by tyranny and censorship. Instead, mindless activities such as "the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy"—games and entertainments in _Brave New World_—would absorb everyone's attention. Postman quotes Huxley's statement about the human "appetite for distractions" posing a greater threat than tyranny.

Postman will consider the possibility Huxley was right in predicting, "[W]hat we love will ruin us."

## Analysis

[Postman](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/author/) wrote _Amusing Ourselves to Death_ in 1985, a year after British writer [George Orwell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/key-figure-analysis/#George_Orwell)'s dystopian novel _1984_ takes place. The novel portrayed a totalitarian government, which limited people's freedoms, controlled their thoughts, and gave the state ultimate authority. Like many dystopias or imaginary states where citizens live undesirable or dehumanizing lives, _1984_ reflected the concerns people had when the novel was written. Orwell wrote _1984_ in 1949 during the Cold War, a tense standoff between Western democracies and the communist Soviet Union. American readers fearfully observed authoritarian states in the Soviet Union and communist-controlled East Germany. If Orwell's vision came true elsewhere in Europe, or even in America, it would destroy citizens' lives and liberties.

In the 1980s and 1990s democracy expanded throughout Europe. The Berlin Wall came down in 1989, uniting East Germany and West Germany. Then the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. All the while, Americans still enjoyed their freedoms, as they do today. No Orwellian leaders marched in and took over. American citizens still participated in democratic elections, a capitalist free market existed, and citizens were still granted freedom of the press. Americans felt they no longer needed to worry about their country becoming a totalitarian government.

Eastern Europe provided real examples of a totalitarian state similar to _1984_. Americans, in particular, viewed communist dictatorships in Eastern Europe as an external enemy—an outsider intruding on their freedoms. The controlling government in _1984_ is personified as "Big Brother." The phrase "Big Brother is watching you" from _1984_ came to represent a surveillance state where everyone is watched.

[Aldous Huxley](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/key-figure-analysis/#Aldous_Huxley)'s dystopia _Brave New World_ didn't show an external foe Americans could recognize. No existing government resembled the drugged, materialist bubble where residents of _Brave New World_ lived and shopped happily. Postman feels that Americans don't recognize the dangers of Huxley's dystopia because they are immersed in a similar world themselves. It is easy to recognize a frightening outside enemy. It's harder to see a corrosive force from within, especially if people like what it has to offer.

As he writes in 1985, Postman notices how television and entertainment define every aspect of American culture, from leisure to education. The _Brave New World_ citizens act as an exaggerated version of an entertainment-focused culture. They enjoy amusements such as the "centrifugal bumblepuppy" game or the "feelies," a virtual reality experience manipulating participants' emotions. The "orgy-porgy" is a ritual involving drugs and sex—with their emotions dampened, participants don't recognize it as a form of mind control.

Huxley chooses nonsensical, childish names for these activities to highlight how they infantilize the citizens. The activity names also sound harmless, showing how a culture can be ruined by seemingly nonthreatening distractions. Postman argues television has a similar infantilizing effect and exploits human emotion just as easily. Even worse, viewers may become dependent on television for information, losing the ability to make mature, independent decisions.

The control techniques differ between the two dystopias. So do the obstacles to free information and a free press. In Huxley's view, a totalitarian state will not need to destroy the truth through censorship or propaganda. The state will only have to replace facts with distracting entertainment. Information remains available, but if no one wants to look for it, it can't have any effect on how people live their lives.

Postman fears important cultural knowledge will disappear if no one remembers it. He also worries about television's focus on present-moment enjoyment eroding Americans' capacity to remember. Throughout _Amusing Ourselves to Death_, he emphasizes the importance of a culture understanding its history. Otherwise, people will lose a part of themselves—individually and collectively—they can never get back.

# Part 1, Chapter 1 : The Medium Is the Metaphor | Summary

## Summary

[Postman](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/author/) opens this chapter with a discussion on how certain American cities serve as focal points to express the country's character and spirit at the time. He cites 20th-century Las Vegas—"a city entirely devoted to the idea of entertainment"—as the city becoming a metaphor for the country as a whole. Politics, news, education, and other aspects of American life now resemble show business, causing Americans to become trivial thinkers. Postman illustrates this by pointing out examples of how the televised image has influenced Americans' thinking when it comes to politics, religion, education, and merchandise.

Anyone reading his book, Postman believes, knows and is concerned about the way entertainment consumes other forms of discourse. However, readers may not know why culture has made this transformation or what the transformation means. Postman admits that he himself does not know the whole story. But he will explore how "the forms of human conversation" create the content of culture. He draws his argument from sources as old as the Greek philosopher Plato, who lived during the 4th and 5th centuries BCE.

By "conversation" Postman means "all techniques and technologies" by which people communicate, not just speech. These different techniques and forms heavily influence the content they can spread. For example, modern-day voters encounter political candidates on television, a medium, which "gives us a conversation through images, not words." The images shift voters' focus away from the candidates' political ideas to focus more on physical appearance.

Television also shows summaries of various world events presented as the "news of the day." This format would not be possible without image-based media. Featured events, such as wars and murders, would still happen around the world, but people would not know about them. The "news of the day" is only possible when viewers can absorb fragmented, incomplete versions of events through images. The form determines the content.

_Amusing Ourselves to Death_ will investigate what Postman calls the most important cultural shift of the late 20th century: the age of typography, or print, declined while the age of television emerged. Since print and television are such different mediums, they communicate vastly different ideas. This shift affects every part of American public life, from politics to faith to education.

To show how forms of communication can shape culture, Postman goes back in history to the Bible. The biblical Old Testament includes the _Decalogue_, or the Ten Commandments, a series of rules dictating how the ancient Israelites should honor their God. The Second Commandment instructs Israelites not to make "graven images" of anything on heaven or earth—they will worship a powerful, universal God they could not see. If the Israelites made images to represent their God, they might start thinking about God differently, possibly with less reverence. Their concept of God would change.

Just as images are a powerful medium of communication, so are spoken and written languages. The features of a language shape the worldview of its speakers. Every new communication method humans discover—from the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic system of writing to the alphabet all the way to television—transforms their culture.

Postman expands on Canadian cultural theorist [Marshall McLuhan](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/key-figure-analysis/#Marshall_McLuhan)'s statement that "the medium is the message." In Postman's view the medium of communication is not just a message—a specific, direct statement—but a metaphor. A metaphor is more subtle. It implies and suggests new realities but does not state them outright. "Media-metaphors" can appear through speech, print, television, or other media. Each time, the metaphors constantly reshape the way people look at the world, often without people noticing the change. Postman illustrates this idea by discussing how, with the invention of the clock, people no longer measured events by eternity and the will of a god—they used the human invention of time. He also describes how the invention of a written language made it possible for people to read, analyze, and criticize the thoughts of others and process events in a new way. Television suggests new ways for people to imagine the world. A metaphor similarly works by suggestion—it provides an image of one thing by comparing it to something else.

To understand media metaphors, readers should consider the source, quantity, speed, context, and symbolic forms of the information they receive through media. It's also important to realize every new tool includes "an idea ... that goes beyond the function of the thing itself." Eyeglasses, for example, suggested people could improve their bodies as they grew older. Microscopes implied there were hidden worlds to examine beyond the immediately visible—not only in physical objects but in mental processes. This discovery led scientists to explore the mind through psychology.

As humans develop new tools, they create new concepts, languages, and conversations. These conversations affect how people view their minds, bodies, and "bodies politic," or collective group identities. People see everything around them, including "nature ... intelligence ... human motivation ... [and] ideology" through the languages they use. Media-metaphors create these languages and shape culture itself.

## Analysis

When [Postman](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/author/) presents media as metaphors, he means that each source of media symbolizes a larger, more significant concept. Postman uses the metaphors to observe how American priorities have changed over the centuries. This change leads to his central thesis: when "all public discourse takes the form of entertainment," a culture is corrupted. His examples of public figures in the 1980s demonstrate increasingly blurred lines between show business and other professions. But he assumes readers recognize this shift already. His task will be to show where the shift came from and how much damage it can do.

Postman is concerned television will erode American culture. He defines _Amusing Ourselves to Death_ as both an investigation and a "lamentation"—an expression of grief or sorrow. In the transition from print to images as a predominant communication tool, he feels culture has lost something valuable.

In its broad definition, the word _culture_ means "the customs and beliefs of a group of people." The term can refer more specifically to the media people share. The phrase _popular culture_ means "the cultural activities and products enjoyed by the majority of people in a society."

People spread culture through communicating. Postman reaches back to ancient societies before the written word existed to show people have always communicated. Members of a group find ways to create a conversation they can all understand. By "conversation" Postman doesn't just mean a verbal dialogue. Any way people exchange messages—through images, writing, debate, performance, or other forms—contributes to a larger cultural conversation. And the exchange doesn't need to be mutual. A television show giving a message to a viewer can be part of a conversation too.

Though readers know communication is central to their lives, they may not consider the importance of _how_ they communicate or receive information. Postman emphasizes the significance of form repeatedly. A written book, a spoken monologue, and a staged performance on television may all have similar content, but the forms are different. According to Postman, the message will also be different, and so will the response of the reader or audience. Forms affect how people develop beliefs, how they define words and concepts, and how they act around others.

Postman brings up weighty concepts such as a culture's moral and ethical systems to show how serious forms of communication can be. To the ancient Israelites who followed the biblical Ten Commandments, the form of their deity was central to their practice of faith. They needed the ability to imagine God as more expansive and eternal than the physical world. So they couldn't create a physical image to represent God.

To Postman forms of communication carry great meaning beyond their content. No image is just an image. No word is just a word. No technology is just a machine once humans use it to communicate—it ends up signifying something more. The television itself and the shows it features may not make direct statements about entertainment and its value to culture. But television implies or suggests certain beliefs about the world. It's harder to identify a suggestion or metaphor than it is to hear a statement or message. But metaphors make a more universal statement. As a result, they become more powerful and long-lasting.

By examining the invention of the clock Postman uncovers how subtle metaphors can be. People schedule their days in ways that reflect their beliefs and priorities. Before clocks people trusted nature and unseen gods to manage their world. People based their activities around sunrise and sunset. Time was eternal and uncontrollable. After timekeeping devices were invented, people had a kind of power they didn't have before. Clocks, not nature, could control when they woke up and slept. They no longer needed unseen gods. Religion faded in importance. The clock became a metaphor for humans' increased desire to rule their own lives and control their environments.

Postman often uses writing as a metaphor for history and historical memory, or people's collective narratives about their past. Once people wrote words down, their ideas became permanent. Messages no longer relied on the memory of human speakers. Nor were they limited to a person's individual circle of listeners. Instead, messages could be recorded for any reader at any future time in history. Writing provided a new way to interpret the past and send messages to the future. Research and learning became possible on a different scale.

Since readers are used to the written word, Postman asks them to see its invention differently—as an event of wonder and magic. He uses the words _magic_ and _vast_ and _trembling shift_ to describe new advances in electronics. These words suggest both awe and terror. Postman implies the "age of television" represents a shift to a new era in Western history. He compares it to two other world-shaking changes: the transition from oral to written communication with the invention of the Greek alphabet around 1000 BCE and the move to a print-based culture in the 15th century with the invention of the printing press. As the mode of communication changed, the culture changed too.

When Postman describes the power of the "metaphors generated by our tools," his definition of _tools_ is a broad one. Anything humans use for a certain purpose can serve as a tool. A science such as genetics, for instance, becomes a tool people use to understand their bodies. A book becomes a tool people use to gather information; reading someone "like a book" means gathering information about their emotional state.

Tools also shape more momentous concepts. Eyeglasses and other innovations permanently changed the way people viewed aging. Eyeglasses turned into a metaphor for mastering and reversing the decline of the body, reducing the fear of death. Postman's point is that each device is much more than what it appears to be. Often, people don't realize the true metaphorical meaning of tools until they have been using them for generations.

# Part 1, Chapter 2 : Media as Epistemology | Summary

## Summary

This chapter explains how forms of media and communication determine a culture's beliefs about truth and intelligence. [Postman](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/author/) begins with an explanation of the American "media-metaphor shift" away from print and toward television. Postman explains that this shift makes most of the public discourse "dangerous nonsense." But this change isn't because of the aesthetic quality of television shows. Postman doesn't want to complain about "junk" or trivial, poorly made shows on television. There's plenty of similar "junk" in print. And since no one takes television's junk seriously, it can't do much damage. The danger arises when people treat television as a serious medium for cultural and intellectual conversations. Instead, Postman will focus on television and media as they relate to _epistemology_, a branch of philosophy studying the origins and nature of human knowledge. Specifically, he will explore how different forms of media provide different definitions of truth.

Postman first explains how many aspects of culture, such as literary phrases and characters, have a trait called _resonance_. Canadian cultural critic Northrop Frye (1912–91) uses the term _resonance_ to describe how something specific can take on universal significance. Objects, characters, books, and even countries can have an imaginative meaning or symbolism to a variety of people. The children's book _Alice's Adventures in Wonderland_ (1865) by British writer Lewis Carroll (1832–98), for instance, features a character named Alice who goes on an imaginative journey. Alice herself becomes a metaphor for "a search for order in a world of semantic nonsense."

Communication media such as print and television can also have resonance, Postman claims. He describes resonance as "metaphor writ large," extending his Chapter 1 discussion of metaphor. Media can shape people's definitions of grand, universal concepts such as truth, goodness, and beauty.

Postman offers three examples of "truth-telling" to prove his point. His first example comes from an African tribe with no written language. Tribal chiefs settle legal disputes not by referring to a written law but by selecting a saying or proverb to fit the situation. This method of judging legal cases would never work in a modern American court. Instead, American courts rely on printed materials such as law books, cases, and citations. Their "media-metaphor" separates them from the African tribe.

His second example demonstrates how American universities consider written or printed language more authentic and trustworthy than spoken language. A student writing an academic thesis included a citation based on a conversation he had in a hotel. The thesis examiners didn't accept this citation as an accurate source. Since "the written word endures; the spoken word disappears," the examiners considered written information a more reliable source of truth than spoken dialogue. The form of the idea affected its truth.

His third example shows how listeners judge the truth of speech based on the speaker's delivery. When the Greek philosopher Socrates was on trial in the fourth century BCE, he didn't prepare an eloquent, organized argument in his defense. Instead, he gave an impromptu speech in a conversational tone. His Greek audience respected rhetoric—prepared, persuasive speech—as an art form. Since Socrates didn't prepare his talk in this way, they considered his words less true.

Postman concludes that people in many different cultures have linked truth "to the biases of forms of expression." These biases extend beyond words to numbers. Modern economists and scientists use numbers to interpret their research, for instance. If they expressed their results in proverbs and poetry instead, no one would believe or respect them. But in ancient Greece, the scientist and thinker Aristotle (384–322 BCE) used words and deductive logic, not numbers, to express scientific truth. To Postman this example shows how a culture's ideas of truth change as its media shifts "from orality to writing to printing to televising."

Communication methods also affect how a culture sees intelligence. Ancient Hebrew culture believed the biblical character King Solomon was wise because he memorized many proverbs. But this culture was based on oral communication. In a culture where people are expected to read and write, the ability to memorize proverbs isn't considered a valuable skill. Instead, intelligence is measured by how well someone can interpret written symbols on a page.

And this type of interpretation isn't so easy. Readers have to determine an author's tone and understand an author's argument. They must think about abstract concepts without pictures to help them. When America was a print-based culture in the 18th and 19th centuries, everyone had to develop these skills. People's ideas of truth and intelligence centered on the printed word. As media changes in the 20th century, ideas of truth and intelligence will change too.

Postman isn't arguing that new forms of media make people less smart or capable. Nor does he believe print will disappear entirely from American culture. The value of print will diminish, but it won't disappear. And although Postman thinks television has a negative effect on public communication, he thinks the medium can have positive results as well. For instance, television shows can comfort and entertain the lonely.

Postman adds that every new media has both good and bad effects on a culture. Typography, or the printed word, led to breakthroughs in science and politics but destroyed the sense of community and the value of poetry in oral civilizations. Though "the future may hold surprises for us" about the role of television, Postman fears television threatens the many benefits typography gave to public discourse.

## Analysis

[Neil Postman](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/author/) focuses on media as a way to understand the world. This is where epistemology, the study of the origins and limits of knowledge, comes in. Postman wants to illuminate the effects of media that readers may not notice. When someone watches a television show about a serious topic, such as a news program or documentary, they will likely recognize they are learning new content. But they might not see how the form or presentation of the content influences their learning. This is partially what Postman means when he describes media as an environment. Just like a biological environment, media surrounds people so constantly that they may forget it's there and they might not pay attention to its effects.

Postman draws on older examples of communication to make his point. When people trusted other media to dictate the truth, such as oral proverbs or written law books, they had a different definition of what _truth_ was. Truth is a fundamental concept to a society; it encompasses ideas of right and wrong, for instance. Postman chooses two examples from courts of law, institutions that help shape a society's idea of right or appropriate public behavior.

To enhance the idea of media as metaphor, Postman adds the term _resonance_—describing a metaphor that stands the test of time. A resonant metaphor transcends the culture and time period it comes from. The metaphor becomes inseparable from the object or concept itself. For instance, Postman can't think about the Greek city of Athens without thinking about "intellectual excellence." Athens is often considered the birthplace of Western culture, study, and philosophy. Even people who have never been to Greece and know nothing else about the city can recognize what it's known for.

Oral proverbs similarly resonate with larger meaning. In oral cultures where people communicate solely through speaking, proverbs become metaphors for wisdom and justice. They define truth. When a west African tribe hears a proverb, they accept it as a fact, giving it authority. Modern American culture only gives this type of authority to the printed word. People don't use ancient sayings to make practical or legal decisions. They consult written laws and guidelines. Furthermore, they often only accept print evidence to prove an event took place. The university student's degree won't be valid in the academic world without written proof.

To Postman this distinction doesn't mean the written word is more "true" or "wise" in one culture than in another. Similarly, statements don't become more or less accurate because they are made in print. What changes is a culture's willingness to accept which statements are true. A spoken statement and a written statement can say the same thing, but one form may be admitted as legal evidence or accepted by a jury while another may not.

Science also changes as tools develop. Once scientists could measure their discoveries with numerical data, they used numbers as the standard for accuracy. By the late 20th century many people, whether they work in the sciences or not, take the presence of these data for granted in scientific proofs. A conclusion in physics, for instance, isn't considered correct without the numbers to back it up. But in the philosopher Aristotle's ancient Greece, this wasn't the case. Again, the facts didn't change, but the mode of communication did.

Concepts such as truth, intelligence, and wisdom may be universal, but cultures need specific ways to define them. By referring to truth as "cultural prejudice," Postman says cultures have an indispensable role in shaping people's basic beliefs and standards. As he explains later in the chapter, he does believe some cultures get closer to the actual truth of the world than others. But he challenges readers to consider their own biases toward the beliefs their own culture promotes.

Definitions of intelligence provide another example of cultural prejudice. Postman says people view intelligence as "the capacity to grasp the truth of things." Since communication tools form ideas of truth, intelligence indicates mastery of a culture's primary form of communication. For instance, a print-based culture might consider someone smart if they've read a lot of books and attended institutions of higher education. Ideas of intelligence affect who people respect, listen to, and trust. But intelligence doesn't mean innate superiority, Postman suggests, only skill at comprehending a certain set of symbols.

He asks readers to imagine how concepts of intelligence might change in the future. As American culture becomes less print-oriented and more image-oriented, people may not associate intelligence with the ability to read print. Postman describes print culture carefully because he believes readers take it for granted. He also thinks print culture is on the way out. Americans may someday view print-based skills as quaint and irrelevant, not intelligent, once print isn't essential to communication. Memorization was once a crucial skill, for example. But once everything could be written down, memorization wasn't as necessary, and it didn't signify intelligence anymore.

Regardless of a culture's communication values, Postman thinks interpreting print is an innately valuable skill. The act of reading requires mental flexibility, reasoning skills, and comfort with abstract concepts. It develops the brain in a way Postman feels helps readers with problem-solving in other areas of life. Once people no longer need to read to survive, Postman fears they might lose other analytical skills without realizing it.

Readers may not see a decline in the importance of print. Postman answers this potential objection by describing the decline as gradual. Like changes in the biological environment, transitions in the "symbolic environment"— the variety of symbols people use to communicate and receive information such as television shows, conversations, advertisements, stories, photographs, and billboards—sneak up on people. They can take years, decades, and even centuries to develop. Postman thinks of media as an ecosystem similar to the biological world—an environment surrounding people wherever they go.

Since an environment takes a long time to transform, people within the environment may not see the full impact until quite a while after the transition. Taking the long historical view, Postman acknowledges television may end up making positive changes to the culture. He also emphasizes that many parts of Western culture that readers have always known—the boundaries of nations and the availability of science and medicine, for instance—came from typography or print. Television and other new technologies could recreate the world in ways that are just as impactful.

But Postman argues television has already damaged discourse, or the exchange of ideas, in America. As media changes, concepts of "education, knowledge, truth, and information" get new meanings. Media redefines them. These concepts as readers know them may alter permanently.

Before describing the impact of image-based discourse, however, Postman shows what discourse in a print-centered culture looked like.

# Part 1, Chapter 3 : Typographic America | Summary

## Summary

[Neil Postman](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/author/)'s focus in this chapter is how 18th- and 19th-century America's reliance on the written word shaped the country's growth, identity, and values. He begins with a rare example of someone choosing not to write ideas down. Michael Welfare, the founder of the 18th-century religious sect the Dunkers, didn't want to write down the Dunkers' religious principles. Welfare feared a written statement of faith would make the Dunkers afraid to change or improve their principles later on, since they considered the printed statement sacred.

To Postman this example shows how seriously early American settlers from England took typography or the printed word. In late 17th-century New England almost all adult male settlers could read. Most settler families owned books, including the Bible, the main text of Protestant religious faith. There were several reasons for this focus on literacy in colonial America. Most settlers came from literate regions in England. Since the 16th century, Europeans had begun to associate the printed word with knowledge. Settlers valued education highly, establishing required grammar schools. They also brought the established literary tradition of Great Britain to the early United States.

Reading wasn't associated with a wealthy upper class. Almost anyone could read and had access to books, regardless of their social status. English-American writer Thomas Paine's (1737–1809) 1776 pamphlet _Common Sense_ was popular with a huge percentage of the population. Paine wrote this influential work despite his lack of formal schooling.

In the late 17th century, American settlers started to develop their own literature separately from the English tradition. They began by printing newspapers. By 1800, newspapers were flourishing with almost 200 different papers circulating in the colonies. Print continued its dominance as American settlement expanded to the south and west. "A national conversation" began through print. Americans revered writers; British novelist Charles Dickens (1812–70) was treated as a celebrity. This interest in reading extended to oral performance. Lecture halls sprang up across the nation. Americans flocked to hear writers, scholars, and entertainers deliver speeches.

Postman reiterates that the United States, founded by European intellectuals, was dominated in its early centuries by the printed word. Print had a monopoly on the media. With no other ways to receive education, information, or entertainment, people relied on print.

As a result, printed discourse shaped every aspect of American life—including, for instance, the way people spoke. They modeled conversations on the structure of print. French writer Alexis de Tocqueville (1805–59) pointed out that "[a]n American ... speaks to you as if he was addressing a meeting." Even the charismatic preachers of the 18th-century Great Awakening valued skilled oratory based on a print tradition.

"Form will determine the nature of content," Postman emphasizes. For instance, he quotes German cultural theorist [Karl Marx](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/key-figure-analysis/#Karl_Marx)'s (1818–83) point that the _Iliad_, a Greek epic poem from an oral culture, could never have come from a print-based civilization. Print makes "the singing and the telling and the muse cease," Marx says. To Postman this example shows how different forms require different contents and different audiences. The printing press required a "serious and rational public conversation" and an audience willing to participate.

## Analysis

[Neil Postman](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/author/) defines the worldwide typographic age—an era when people communicated through the printed word—as about four centuries long. He dates it from the 15th-century invention of the printing press to the mid-19th century combination of the photograph and telegraph. In the United States the typographic age lasted from the colonial settlers' arrival in the late 17th century to the mid-19th century.

American settlers recognized that print is powerful. Michael Welfare, an 18th-century practitioner of the Dunker faith, realized what Greek philosopher Plato realized: print leads to permanence. It allows thoughts to be preserved in history so later generations can read them. And it stretches the cultural conversation over time. If the Dunkers' beliefs were written down, modern readers could learn more about religion in colonial America. But to Welfare and other Dunkers, the act of writing their beliefs would shape their religious practice.

To Postman the printed word helped form the United States' idea of itself as a diverse, inclusive, and vibrant culture. His description of 17th- and 18th-century America isn't a complete picture of the country at the time. Though both the upper and working classes could read, class division did exist. Most women, Native Americans, and people of color were excluded from discourse, much more so than in the 20th century. But Postman's main goal is to show how the form of print itself leads to intellectual discussion and exchange of ideas. Because the early United States got its information from print, people were more prepared to share thoughts about important topics.

The popularity of writer Thomas Paine's 1776 pamphlet _Common Sense_ shows how early settlers used print to engage in issues affecting their lives. In _Common Sense_ Paine argued for American independence from Great Britain after the Battles of Lexington and Concord. This was a major topic in the colonies—controversial and immediately relevant. Postman sees the pamphlet's popularity as evidence colonists wanted a voice in the political process. They sought to be involved citizens, not just spectators.

Soon, newspapers and pamphlets became a larger metaphor for freedom of thought. As America emerged as an independent nation, it needed a forum for debate where everyone could speak. The volume of newspapers demonstrates a diversity of opinion and interest in current events. Print, unlike television, forced writers to express their ideas in a linear fashion. It forced readers to engage with arguments.

Even when people weren't learning, Postman emphasizes, their brains were working. He knows the value of entertainment to a culture. As an entertainment medium, print dictated how Americans spent their leisure hours and determined their notions of celebrity. Print-based America wasn't naturally more studious, noble, or serious than television-based America. People still liked to have a good time.

Postman's point is that print and spoken word based on print encourage traits vital to critical, independent thinking. This is the case whether someone is reading for business or pleasure. The structure of printed matter requires readers to analyze claims, pay careful attention to words, and exercise intellectual curiosity. Readers have to give the text their full attention and confront what it has to say.

If these are the traits a medium encourages, these are the traits people will value and respect, whether they intend to or not. And they'll unconsciously apply these skills to other areas of life. Their spoken dialogue will be clearer and more formal, for example. Their problem-solving abilities will be rooted in analysis. Their thought process will take details into account.

He quotes Alexis de Tocqueville, a French historian known for his insightful observations of 19th-century American culture. de Tocqueville noticed something unique about how Americans communicated, something he didn't observe in his native Europe, another print-based society. The structure of print seeped into Americans' oral conversations, especially in the generations after America's founding. Citizens had never known anything but a print-centric culture.

Postman goes further to say the Founding Fathers, the men who set up the early United States government, prized an intellectual, rational mindset. A country's founding circumstances inform its development and sense of identity. And Postman argues that print played a crucial role when the young country decided what it wanted to be.

He uses verbal irony when he mentions the United States' ability to "recover" from a print-based discourse. Though recovery is usually a positive development, Postman takes the opposite stance. He's concerned the changing form of discourse will permanently alter both how and what people communicate. For example, he mentions the _Iliad_, an eighth-century BCE Greek epic poem that came from the tradition of oral storytelling. Epic poetry was rooted in oral, or spoken, discourse. Even when poets wrote their epics down, they used a certain rhyme, meter, and flow to mimic the cadence of a story that was recited or sung. As print replaced oral storytelling, the epic gradually disappeared. Postman suggests print-based communication techniques—rhetoric, critical analysis, and logical frameworks—might become less common too.

# Part 1, Chapter 4 : The Typographic Mind | Summary

## Summary

An 1858 debate between United States politicians Abraham Lincoln (1809–65) and Stephen A. Douglas (1813–61) lasted for seven hours. The large, intrigued audience stuck around despite the length of the speeches. At the time Lincoln and Douglas weren't yet presidential candidates. Audiences considered debates such an important part of political and social life that they gave their attention to relatively unknown figures. "Stump" speeches, where orators spoke by the stump of a tree, drew involved audiences who responded emotionally to the speakers' points.

These talks made demands of their listeners. First of all, audiences needed a long attention span. They needed some knowledge of the topics the speakers were debating. And they needed to understand many features of persuasive speech, such as sarcasm, verbal irony, contradiction, and metaphor. The debates were enjoyable social events, not challenging academic exercises. Audiences in the mid-19th century were comfortable with "language as a means of complex argument."

[Postman](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/author/) connects this mindset to the "Empire of Reason" in 18th-century America, a time when literature and oratory were valued in the country. The 20th century, he mentions, would end the Empire of Reason, when photography and telegraphs became more widespread.

But in the 19th century, print still controlled discourse. Speakers such as Lincoln and Douglas modeled their speeches on the complicated sentence and paragraph structures of written text. They built arguments, rebutted their opponents' claims, and used critical thinking strategies. The audience was required to think critically in response.

The act of reading requires and rewards such critical thinking. First, Postman says, written words come with a specific content. Words make a claim or state an idea. They have a certain meaning, and a reader must work to understand the meaning. The process of reading demands the reader use a serious and rational approach. Written content must also present ideas in a coherent order. Readers should be able to recognize lies and illogical statements.

Postman connects the rise of American print culture to the Enlightenment, or the age of reason, a European cultural movement emphasizing science, education, and knowledge. Print encouraged an analytical thought process in all areas of life. Religion, for example, used the rational discourse encouraged by the printed word. Many prominent early Americans were deists, believing in a creator who didn't intervene in human affairs. Deists fought religious superstition and defended their beliefs with reasoned arguments. Even devout American revivalist preachers such as Jonathan Edwards (1703–58), George Whitefield (1714–70), and Charles Finney (1792–1875) prized scholarly thought and logic. Edwards researched his sermons thoroughly, and Finney trained as a lawyer. Several religious denominations founded American universities. Harvard and Yale, for instance, were created to educate potential ministers.

Law also showed the effects of print-based discourse. Lawyers needed an extensive education and sophisticated argumentative skills. Famous 18th and 19th-century lawyers such as John Marshall (1755–1835) and Daniel Webster (1782–1852) were known for their brilliant, logical analyses and nuanced use of language.

Even advertising was affected by the reasoned mindset of a print culture. Advertisers assumed consumers would be "literate, rational, analytical." As a result American advertisements from the 17th to the 19th centuries offered details about the practical benefits of the product for sale. Their purpose was to give the consumer information. Potential buyers could decide if the advertiser's claims were true or false. But advertisements changed in the 1890s. Illustrations and photographs accompanied the words. Brief, catchy slogans and jingles became prominent. Advertisers focused more on the emotions of consumers and the look of the ad than on the truth of the ad's claims.

In earlier centuries Americans judged public figures, such as lawyers, ministers, and politicians, by their words alone. People didn't know what most famous personalities looked like. By contrast most 20th-century Americans recognize well-known figures by their faces. Americans in previous centuries also had less time to read for pleasure. When they did read it was a serious, sacred activity. Government leaders assumed anyone who participated in civic life would be educated and able to read.

Postman calls the first two print-dominated centuries of the United States the age of exposition. Exposition, or detailed description and explanation, characterizes print and the logical skills it demands of its readers. By the end of the 19th century the age of show business was taking over.

## Analysis

The 1858 Lincoln-Douglas debates tackled topics directly affecting their audience. Controversy was swirling over the potential abolition of slavery, an issue threatening to divide the country and eventually cause the Civil War. Like the earlier readers of Thomas Paine's _Common Sense_, audience members were attentive and active civic participants.

But the form of the debates was just as important as the topic. Speakers could provide thoughtful analysis and respond to each other in real time. Audience members added their opinions and felt involved. The speakers' long sentences and complex clauses meant they'd given the topic their full attention. They treated their listeners as intelligent adults capable of engaging in earnest debate. Listeners were entertained but not condescended to or patronized. Instead, the audience was expected to keep up with the speakers' dexterity and wit.

Similarly, Lincoln and Douglas expected their audience had been following along with developments in the U.S. government. For listeners to know the stakes of the debate, they needed access to a coherent narrative about current events. They needed to see how the past and present might affect the future.

Postman pays attention not just to the form of conversation—in person, on a page, or through a television screen—but the form of sentences themselves. Written sentences need complex grammatical structure to be understood. A sentence in a written paragraph has to connect to the rest of the paragraph in a logical way. Again, Postman associates print with logic, unity, and sequence. A world in print is a world that makes sense.

But language is dynamic, not static. It evolves as its speakers, writers, and forms change. The transition to "plain language" for "people of a television culture" implies language itself is undergoing a revolution.

[Neil Postman](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/author/) often uses words suggesting long-term, permanent change. He borrows American historian Henry Steele Commager's (1902–98) phrase "Empire of Reason" to put the Lincoln-Douglas debates and their environment in a more extended historical context. The word _empire_ indicates widespread domination. The phrase connects the United States to the 17th- and 18th-century European Enlightenment, a cultural revolution emphasizing science, rationality, and learned wisdom over religion and mysticism. The Enlightenment was a huge cultural shift, and communication played a major role.

Postman connects print to other kinds of post-Enlightenment progress in the Western world. People felt more in control of their own lives. They no longer accepted the authority of kings as divine or godlike. Capitalism, an economic system driven by private profit, encouraged independent financial growth. Science prized an objective outlook and an understanding of nature.

How does print itself encourage a rational mindset? Postman starts his analysis by considering what words do in the first place. They state an idea or make a claim. The claim can be fact or opinion, true or false, right or wrong. But the words have a definite meaning. The reader has to understand this meaning and then decide what to do with the information they're given.

Postman emphasizes the importance of exposition, or description and explanation. Readers require exposition to truly learn a concept. And only words can describe and explain. He calls the print-based era the age of exposition frequently.

Print does more than deliver statements; it helps readers process these statements and make sense out of them. American linguist Walter Ong's (1912–2003) phrase "analytical management of knowledge" suggests learners can't just collect information—they have to manage it. Readers have to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant facts, identify false claims, and develop their own opinions.

As a result, readers use their thoughts, not their emotions, to interpret print. Words can have a strong emotional effect. But first the reader has to know what is being said. They think before they feel. Image-based media, by contrast, encourage viewers to feel before they think. It's possible to have an emotional reaction to an image before fully comprehending what it is.

People in a print-based culture develop analytical skills because they have to in order to read. As a result, they can recognize lies and bad logic. They're well equipped to think for themselves, Postman believes, and less likely to be manipulated emotionally by media.

This mindset translated to every discipline. Religion, for instance, is an area many people associate with piety, superstition, and subservience to authority. The Great Awakening, a Protestant Christian religious revival in the 18th-century United States, had an emotional effect on converts. But in the print age, leading religious thinkers applied rigorous analysis to their faith. People were converted by "no force other than reason itself." Religious denominations founded universities to encourage intellectual exploration.

Along with reason came skepticism. Deism, the faith many of the Founding Fathers possessed, believes in a higher power that doesn't intervene in human lives. Along with libertines, or free thinkers in religious matters, deists felt humans were capable of making their own decisions without divine help. Even emotionally persuasive sermons gave listeners reasons to believe, showing respect for the audience's ability to make up their own minds.

Postman sees religion as a powerful cultural force associated with a community's definitions of morality. And he thinks discourse affects religion. When describing the 20th-century Protestant religious revival led by American evangelists such as Oral Roberts (1918–2009) and Billy Graham (1918–2018), Postman puts "great awakening" in quotation marks. In his view the new generation of evangelists focuses more on performance and public image than on the basics of faith. Roberts was known for his wealth and Graham for his spectacular circus-tent crusades. This focus has everything to do with the new medium of television, which centers on images rather than words.

The legal system is equally significant; it helps form a society's ideas of justice, crime, and punishment. Law is also a field that thrives on logic. Postman uses the phrase "Typographic Man" to describe an archetype, or typical example, of a public figure in the age of exposition.

John Marshall, former chief justice of the Supreme Court and founder of constitutional law, showed many traits that print-based discourse encourages. He read widely both in ancient and emerging law. He used logical thought processes such as the admission of facts before a conclusion. People admired these skills. Orator Daniel Webster was a folk hero. Postman brings up American writer Stephen Vincent Benét's (1898–1943) short story "The Devil and Daniel Webster," in which Webster successfully argues a case against the Devil to show how a public speaker became a hero in the popular imagination.

Then Postman transitions to advertising, a field modern readers probably don't associate with reason or logic. Through advertising, Postman begins to chart the decline of public discourse. His examples of early print-based advertisements deal in facts—what, where, when, who, and why. They are a paragraph long, giving the reader time to make a decision. They prove words demand thought and analysis no matter where people encounter them.

Slogans, or short memorable phrases, don't make the same demands. They tell people next to nothing about the product being sold. But they're easy to remember. As Postman will describe in Chapter 5, the pairing of an image with a short phrase doesn't give much context. It can, however, produce an instinctual emotional response. The H-O image of a happy baby eating cereal, for instance, may bring up positive emotions in the viewer. Viewers will associate the advertised brand with these positive feelings. They are not reasoned with—they're manipulated.

Postman sees a fundamental difference in the information people get from words and the information they get from images. This difference goes further than advertising. It affects how people act. Constant reading, he argues, makes people believe the world is "a serious, coherent place" that can be improved through logical methods. So, people work to make their surroundings better. They think through decisions about what to buy or whether or not to join a religious faith. They can tell when others are lying or contradicting themselves. They expect exposition—description and explanation—and they expect the world to make sense.

These aren't just mindsets associated with print. They are associated with maturity and adulthood. A world run by print is fundamentally a more grown-up world according to Postman. He believes print also contributed to American equality of opportunity. The frontier opened up new options for women because women were already literate and part of the cultural conversation. The literacy requirement kept voters well informed. Everyone took responsibility for the world they wanted to see.

#  Part 1, Chapter 5 : The Peek-a-Boo World | Summary

## Summary

In the mid-19th century two ideas, one old and one new, created a new metaphor of public discourse in America. The new idea proposed information could travel over a great physical distance, represented by the telegraph. The old idea offered images as a way to understand the world, represented by the photograph.

When electricity became commonplace in America during the mid-19th century, inventor Samuel Morse (1791–1872) figured out he could use energy to send messages. His discovery gave birth to the telegraph. People in different areas of the country now could communicate quickly. Morse boasted that the telegraph would turn the United States into "one neighborhood."

[Postman](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/author/) argues that the telegraph redefined public discourse but not for the better. The telegraph would "not only permit but insist" on cross-country discourse even if there was nothing important to say. The new medium introduced "irrelevance, impotence, and incoherence" to public dialogue. Information could now be sent without a context. News didn't have to be significant or relevant to the reader; it just had to be interesting.

The telegraph quickly partnered with the printing press. Newspapers were no longer local documents delivering reports specifically to an area's residents. They became national organizations spreading information as quickly and widely as possible. When the nationwide Associated Press was founded in 1846, it filled the papers with "news from nowhere, addressed to no one in particular." The news lost its relevance to readers. Postman challenges contemporary readers to consider how this news environment affects their lives. Readers can hear and see news from around the world on a daily basis. They may discuss news stories with others. But how often will people take meaningful action in response to a story in the media? Information is only important when it leads to action, Postman argues. Few modern consumers of the news do anything when they hear about worldwide disasters, conflicts, or atrocities. They have few realistic options except voting for political candidates who can make change.

Posttelegraphy news also became incoherent, or impossible to understand. The telegraph's job was "to move information, not collect it, explain it, or analyze it," Postman says. Compared to books, which strive to make permanent records, telegraphs require readers to forget information immediately. Headlines are quickly replaced by more headlines. News items don't connect to one another. The reader experiences the news as disjointed fragments, not as a continuous story. This new form of public discourse also leads to a new definition of intelligence, which becomes "knowing _of_ lots of things, not knowing _about_ them."

While the telegraph changed the meaning of information, another invention changed the meaning of nature and reality. This was French scientist Louis Daguerre's early 19th-century daguerreotype, the first successful form of photography. Later in the century, English mathematician William Henry Fox Talbot created the negative-positive photographic process, allowing photographs to be reproduced, printed, and published. People could now access a new method of discourse through images.

To Postman an image-based discourse and a discourse based on words inhabit completely different universes. Postman is wary of describing photography as a "language," for instance. While words invite the possibility of abstract concepts, images deal only with concrete representations of objects.

Photographs and images also lack syntax, or the arrangement of words into fully formed ideas. Words present ideas in a certain logical order and context through phrases, sentences, and arguments. Photographs, by contrast, take a single image away from its broader context and freeze the image by itself. As a result, photographs show a series of individual, unconnected events without a beginning, middle, and end.

The mid-19th century was when photographs, posters, billboards, drawings, and other image displays began appearing everywhere in America. American historian Daniel Boorstin (1914–2004) calls this shift a "graphic revolution." Postman adds the phrase "a fierce assault on language." Images worked to replace language as a way for Americans to understand reality.

Between the photograph and the telegraph, people had to absorb information in a new way. Their experience of reading the news became "a sea of facts from unknown places about strangers with unknown faces." When a photograph accompanied a headline, the reader had a little more context for a strange news item. The mid-19th century also saw the rise of crossword puzzles as entertainment. Postman suggests people needed some way to put the onslaught of random information to use. They created a "pseudo-context" for the information—a structure where the disconnected facts would apply to their lives, but only to amuse them.

New forms of media such as film and radio in the late 19th and early 20th centuries followed the lead of the photograph and telegraph. They combined "image and instancy." Media presented intriguing but fragmented information without historical context or complexity. The world the new technologies created resembled the child's game of "peek-a-boo" to Postman—"entirely self-contained" and "endlessly entertaining."

Television perfected what the photograph and telegraph had begun. But this technology took the combination of image and instancy to a dangerous level. In the late 20th century, Postman observes a country centered on television. Everyone watches it, regardless of age or life situation. Every topic is eventually discussed on television. And television even influences people's consumption of other media. People learn about the possibilities of computers, for instance, through television programs.

In fact, television has now "achieved the status of 'myth,'" Postman says. He cites 20th-century French philosopher Roland Barthes's (1915–80) use of the word _myth_ to describe a natural, unconscious way of understanding the world. Television is taken for granted. It doesn't shape or reflect culture—it has become culture. Postman believes the most dangerous consequence of television's prominence is the fact it seems normal, not strange, to most Americans. People have adjusted to the versions of reality television presents.

Postman will use the second half of the book to reveal "the epistemology of television," or the way television shapes viewers' ideas about knowledge and truth. He will argue that television promotes a "way of knowing" directly hostile to a print-based culture. Furthermore, television speaks only in the voice of entertainment; it can only be trivial, never serious. And each cultural institution in America is becoming so affected by television that they will all become arenas for entertainment as well. Postman fears Americans may accept and enjoy this result.

## Analysis

Americans tend to view new technology as positive progress. The telegraph seemed like an exciting development, marking the new openness and possibility of the expanding American frontier. Postman describes the combination of the press and telegraph as promising the "dazzle of distance and speed." The word choice indicates people were enchanted by the ability to see the world in a way they had never seen it before.

Throughout _Amusing Ourselves to Death_, [Neil Postman](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/author/) encourages a cautious, critical approach to technology with an eye toward both short-term and long-term outcomes. He knows new devices and their capabilities come with a sense of romance and magic that can cloud judgment.

One of Postman's central arguments in Chapter 5 is the difference between information and knowledge. Information can take the form of an isolated fact, such as a piece of interesting trivia with no relevance to the life of the learner. But knowledge requires the ability to remember, interpret, analyze, and use information rather than just collecting it. In other words, just because someone has information doesn't mean they are informed.

In fact, greater access to information leads to a _less_ informed population, Postman believes. When media sources deliver a constant stream of facts, people are more likely to absorb the facts and believe they've learned something new. Postman thinks they haven't learned anything. They didn't seek targeted knowledge about a certain topic, research what they found, or make conclusions.

The nature of the information also changes the audience's reaction. When people learned facts with relevance to their lives they took these facts seriously—they were expected to take an action or form a belief as a result. New facts came with no responsibility attached to them. They could be taken lightly, almost as if they did not really happen.

When someone else's reality becomes a piece of interesting trivia, Postman implies, the reality itself is diminished. The information means less to the recipient. It joins a parade of "sensational events" that can desensitize people to the lives of others.

Modern readers are accustomed to an information environment where they can access global news easily. Postman encourages his readers to think about how this news affects their thought processes. They may have emotional responses when they hear about tragedies in a faraway state or country, for instance. But they can turn this new information into knowledge by researching events in the country and learning about any concrete actions they can take. With only information, readers feel helpless; with knowledge, they're empowered.

He urges critical thought to combat what he calls the "demons of discourse." Postman describes these demons by using antonyms, or words directly opposing other concepts. Irrelevance replaces relevance. Impotence replaces potency or the power to make an impression. Incoherence replaces coherence.

Irrelevance came when the news lost a sense of an audience—a crucial aspect of information sharing. Anyone who makes an argument, for example, should know what they want their audience to do as a result. In rhetoric or persuasive speech, for instance, the argument has a goal: to convince the listener to take a certain stance or react a certain way.

To Postman good journalism requires a nuanced sense of audience as well. News stories can tell an audience about events happening across the country. But Postman believes the reporters' real job is to make the listeners care about the events. Only then can the "global village" lead to community in any meaningful sense. Readers might consider what makes a reported piece of media truly engage its audience and build empathy.

Impotence, or lack of power, Postman says, comes from too much information and too few action tips. Being overwhelmed by worldwide atrocities can make news consumers feel helpless. Postman's direct reader address considers a frustration he suspects many modern readers face. Even when people do decide to take action based on a reported story, they still have to pick from a multitude of stories. Also, they will likely need to research the problem further so they can proceed effectively. Research itself requires a sense of history and an ability to connect facts to other facts. The modern news environment does not give people the thinking skills to make these connections.

Postman isn't advocating for readers to turn off the news. Instead, he wants them to just consider it more thoughtfully. He wants readers to ask what it means to be an ethical consumer of information, or an informed voter and civic participant.

Incoherence emerges because news fragments don't give people the complete picture of a story. More information makes it harder, not easier, to know what is really happening. Postman finds misleading and incomplete information just as dangerous as outright false information. Chapter 9 further discusses the implications of people _thinking_ they know the whole story when they only know a small part of it.

He also highlights how the meaning of concepts changed as the news environment transformed.

"Knowing" the facts no longer meant "[understanding] implications, background, or connections." Knowledge became much simpler to achieve. People might believe they know a fact or situation if they read a news headline about it, for instance. But their knowledge begins and ends with the headline.

Seeing a photograph or image might similarly lead viewers to think they understand what's being portrayed. But images require a different type of understanding. Individual photographs, Postman says, have no continuity or connection to the wider world on their own. They offer no sense of a longer story explaining why these objects are in this place at this time. This sense requires syntax, or the grammatical structure of words and phrases used to create sentences. Syntax gives sentences their sense of past, present, and future possibilities. Verbs tell readers what happens, what has already happened, or what might happen. They provide a sequence of beginning, middle, and end. Without some grasp of this sequence, people can't understand what is happening in a photograph.

People can think critically about images and learn from them. To do so, however, they need to look beyond the obvious. Postman paraphrases filmmaker and writer Susan Sontag to drive home the importance of questioning "the world as it appears." A series of photographs, for example, can tell a story. But viewers still need tools to analyze this story, and those tools come from language. Words and languages have a precision that images don't have.

But words don't lead to understanding on their own. A headline attached to a photograph, as in the "news of the day" format, might tell viewers what they are looking at. However, the viewers still don't know why the image is important to their lives or why they should pay attention. They don't know what happened before and after the photograph was taken. And images often tend to evoke emotions before they encourage analysis. A viewer may feel strongly about a photograph without fully understanding its contents.

Still, photographs provided an intimate connection to faraway events, even if the connection was incomplete. People could see a photograph and mistakenly believe they knew its context. And news editors presented a world not nearly as complex and nuanced as the real world. To Postman this brand new information format led the media environment to create an artificial world. He draws on American social historian Daniel Boorstin's description of a "pseudo-event," or an event staged only for publicity. Boorstin believed pseudo-events appealed to people's desire to be informed about important topics.

A pseudo-event might not present relevant facts, but it might feature well-known public figures who give the public the illusion the event is significant. For instance, people may think a trivial fact is important simply because it is featured on the news. Or they may think they are fully briefed on an international conflict after seeing a series of photographs taken in another country. To Postman the "pseudo-context" is another form of misinformation. It doesn't take the tactic described in 20th-century British writer [George Orwell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/key-figure-analysis/#George_Orwell)'s dystopia _1984_ where the "Ministry of Truth" convinces the public to believe lies. But it does mislead.

Instead, the news environment resembles British writer [Aldous Huxley](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/key-figure-analysis/#Aldous_Huxley)'s earlier dystopia _Brave New World_, where residents are encouraged to forget about history. The leaders in _Brave New World_ invent fascinating distractions so that citizens get excited about the future. By comparison the past seems boring. Fascination, however, is easy. New information comes with the wonder of the unknown, so it always has the potential to be intriguing. History requires study, analysis, and sustained attention. This is one reason why Postman is skeptical of television as a teaching tool. The act of displaying one image after another, as in a television show, implies the viewer should always be prepared to see something new. Viewers don't have to remember what happened before or connect those events to what happens next—as they might if they were reading print. All they have to do is watch.

Postman's central thesis assumes television, no matter the topic, is always there to entertain. Modern viewers may expect all information to captivate them and keep them occupied, or they may expect every instructor or public figure to entertain them. More importantly, they may not even realize they have this expectation.

Postman's statement about how television impacts everyone's "ways of knowing" relates directly to the time in which he writes. In 1985 television was the dominant medium in the United States for getting information. Since then the dominant medium has evolved—but Postman's point is people will shape their worlds around whichever technology they use most often.

Television has become a myth, or a story everyone accepts as truth without really knowing why. Cultures originally created myths to explain natural phenomena. Myths, as Postman describes them, are crucial to understanding an often confusing world. Myths are also extremely powerful. Since myths saturate a culture's environment, it can be disorienting to take a step back and see how these myths are formed. But in Postman's view, a step backward is necessary.

Part 2 will examine "the epistemology of television," or what television teaches people about the truths of their world. Though technology has evolved since the time in which Postman wrote, he believes the prominence of images is here to stay. Therefore, he wants the arguments in Part 2 to contain valuable information for the reader about their world. His goal is to give readers tools to interpret the images they see and unpack what these images are really trying to tell them.

# Part 2, Chapter 6 : The Age of Show Business | Summary

## Summary

[Neil Postman](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/author/) disagrees with the idea that television can represent an extension of the literary tradition. In fact, he says television attacks literate culture. He encourages readers to ask themselves what television is, what conversations television allows, and what culture it shapes.

To clarify his discussion of television as a medium, Postman distinguishes between a medium and a technology. A technology is a physical device or a machine. A medium is a use for the device and the "social and intellectual environment" the device creates. Television becomes a medium when it affects the public dialogue.

For instance, television in the democratic United States is a different medium from television in a totalitarian government. Totalitarian states may only offer one channel and air only programs dedicated to a government agenda. Television in the United States has many channels and a free market for the channels to compete. The medium changes, but the technology is the same.

And American television is admired worldwide for its visually accomplished and diverse programming—even though America's global reputation has declined in other ways.

Television has made audiences expect all experiences and subjects to be presented as entertainment. News programs, for instance, cover serious and tragic events. However, the programs use inviting music, pleasant commercials, and attractive newscasters to enhance viewers' enjoyment. Viewers are encouraged not to take the news seriously. Postman doesn't blame the producers of the program but rather the medium of television itself.

To demonstrate how television is never the right place for instructional, thoughtful content, Postman describes a 1983 televised discussion about nuclear warfare. Producers meant for the discussion to be serious. They picked a controversial topic and didn't include background music. They invited six well-known scholars and intellectual figures to participate, including writer and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel (1928–2016), American diplomat Henry Kissinger (b. 1923), and former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara (1916–2009). Though the program promised viewers a discussion, it didn't provide one. Each participant got five minutes to speak on his own. The speakers didn't address or debate points made by others. Their remarks were intelligent but lacked context and explanation.

An actual discussion was impossible on television, Postman argues. Debate requires thought and reflection, which would bore viewers. Television requires performance. To be successful, a show needs to be something people want to watch. Vision is a concept included in the word tele_vision_—people enjoy watching rapidly moving pictures, not complex ideas.

Since television has "become the model for how the world is properly to be staged," people expect to be entertained off-screen too. Professionals in many fields work to hold the public's interest in engaging ways. Preachers play popular music during services, and students learn history and English through rock songs. Courtroom trials and medical surgeries are televised to eager audiences. Movie stars receive honorary degrees indicating the public's reverence toward these stars. And the televised 1984 presidential debates featured candidates more concerned with style and impressions than with policy. These developments prove to Postman that professionals in all fields are now expected to perform "good showmanship" rather than cultivate the skills of their jobs.

## Analysis

The questions in the paragraph beginning "What is television?" are ongoing ones. [Postman](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/author/) doesn't think his text can provide complete answers. But he wants the reader to keep these questions at the front of their mind.

The distinction between a technology and a medium emphasizes the symbolic importance of television, recalling Chapter 1's discussion of medium as metaphor. A communication technology becomes a medium once people use it. People's use of it is what grants the medium power. Borrowing from Canadian media theorist [Marshall McLuhan](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/key-figure-analysis/#Marshall_McLuhan), Postman suggests a social and intellectual environment is like a biological environment. When biologists change the medium or environment in which organisms grow, the organisms adapt to the new medium. Humans are surrounded by media the way organisms are surrounded by physical stimuli. When humans alter their media environment, their culture will adapt.

Postman mentions how the advance of the United States to a global superpower contributed to television-centered culture. America in the 20th century celebrated free-market economic competition, liberal democracy, and globalization. American television reflected the nation's ideas about itself—big, spectacular, and overcoming competition for attention.

A stronger influence on the television environment, however, is the way people experience images. Chapter 5 explained the viewers' instinct is to absorb an image, not reflect on it and analyze it. Most people can process images much more quickly than they can process words. Images have to advance rapidly to keep a viewer's sustained attention. When a medium shows one image after another, there's no time to slow down, let the viewer process the information, and explain what they should know. But there's plenty of room for novelty and variety.

Serious subjects, Postman says, can't be presented through a series of images. No viewer will have time to give the subjects the thought and attention they deserve. And no performer on a television show will have the time to explain. To illustrate this point he describes a 1983 show, which discussed a highly relevant topic at the time—the possibility of nuclear war. Over 100 million American viewers had just seen the TV movie _The Day After_, a fictional story of Americans who survive after nuclear weapons destroy the country. Audiences were traumatized. The broadcast itself was controversial, inviting questions about the national government's role in nuclear development and arms reduction. The film's devastation seemed like a real possibility.

A national dialogue could have been an opportunity for a frightened public to process what they'd seen and get answers to their questions. Like the Lincoln-Douglas debates described in Chapter 4, the 1983 panel could have engaged the participants in an earnest discussion.

But the format of the television program, which was filmed and/or broadcast before a live audience, and how the producers and network chose to edit it did not allow for the panelists to talk to one another. They couldn't exchange ideas, express doubt, or ask for clarification. They weren't even talking about the same thing. No one modeled the act of thinking—or of learning—for viewers. Just as in the disconnected "news of the day," panel viewers got facts without context. With "no agreement on exactly what the subject was, the panel had the flaws of telegraph news—irrelevance and incoherence. And each participant was pressured to play a role. Television requires performance, Postman says, and performance requires artifice. People on television have to become someone other than who they really are. Postman describes American diplomat Henry Kissinger as "superb in the part of the knowing world statesman." Kissinger wasn't just a statesman, he was playing the part of one, as an actor might. Astronomer Carl Sagan wasn't just a scientist but was performing the role of a scientist. Rather than present the panelists as experts in their lived professions, television presented them as characters. The public, despite knowing the panelists were real professionals, might have subconsciously seen them as characters because they were on television. As a result, viewers wouldn't take their words as seriously.

Postman compares the panel to a play by Irish absurdist 20th-century playwright Samuel Beckett (1906–89), whose surreal dramas suggested a world with no order or sense. Events might happen at random with no evident cause and effect. Absurdist plays intended to alienate and disturb, not instruct. Television, according to Postman, presents a similarly alienating and absurd world with no context for events.

Adding to the absurdity of television is the tendency of all topics to become performing arts. In Postman's view, just because anything can be televised doesn't mean it should be. When intimate, high-stakes events such as medical bypass surgeries and rape trials are televised, the nature of the events changes and so does the nature of professions. Everyone's under pressure to entertain. Otherwise, they'll lose the audience.

This emphasis on performance is highlighted by the reverence the public gives to actors. Actress Meryl Streep (b. 1949) was applauded with such fervor at the Yale commencement exercises because actors are shrouded in an aura of glamour and sophistication. They represent a world people admire.

One thing American culture learns about itself through television, Postman suggests, is that good performance has become the new standard for excellence. Postman's especially attentive to how performance requirements affect the institutions of education and organized religion. He sees these institutions as significant to shaping culture and community, and he'll discuss them at length in Chapters 8 and 10.

# Part 2, Chapter 7 : "Now ... This" | Summary

## Summary

Radio and television newscasters often use the phrase "now ... this" to transition from one topic to the next. To [Postman](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/author/) the phrase indicates that the two events—the one the viewers have just seen and the event they're about to see—have nothing to do with each other. The disjointed arrangement creates a world with "no order or meaning ... not to be taken seriously."

As Postman discussed in Chapter 5, this random, scattered presentation of facts was introduced by the combination of the telegraph and photograph. But television perfected the "'Now ... this' worldview." Almost every half hour of television is a different event. Viewers don't have to put the information in context or consider its value to their lives.

Postman offers an example of the daily news, which presents "news as pure entertainment." News producers choose attractive people as newscasters, knowing the public will accept these individuals more easily. And if viewers like the person delivering the news, they are more likely to trust the report. This indicates that the perception of truth relies on the performance of the person sending the message.

Other features of the news indicate its main goal is to entertain. Producers select engaging music to begin and end a news segment. They keep reports brief—the average news story is only 45 seconds long. Film footage is given priority over verbal reports, and newscasters don't react with emotion or concern no matter how distressing a story is. Commercials divert attention from news programs, implying the news isn't serious at all.

Postman believes this presentation of the news does great damage to viewers' ideas of the world. The format suggests world events are insignificant and that tragedy is exaggerated. News programs deliver "anticommunication .... [abandoning] logic, reason, sequence, and rules of contradiction." Postman quotes newscaster and news editor Robert MacNeil as proof. MacNeil reports that the goal of the news is to present concepts briefly, avoid complexity and nuance, and engage the viewers with constant variety. Producers need to reach a large audience to stay on the air, so they present an entertaining package.

In the long term this news format has led to Americans becoming "the least well-informed people in the Western world," Postman argues. For example, the 1979–81 Iranian hostage crisis received extensive television coverage. But few Americans learned much about Iranian history, faith, or politics. They did, however, cultivate strong opinions about the crisis, informed by emotion.

Postman goes on to say television delivers "disinformation" rather than information. Disinformation isn't necessarily false, but it's misleading: incomplete, irrelevant, or unimportant. But it creates the illusion of knowledge. As a result, viewers consider themselves well informed even if they aren't. As evidence Postman quotes a February 15, 1983, _New York Times_ article about then-President Ronald Reagan. The article states news reporters are giving less attention to misleading and inaccurate statements that Reagan makes as president. This lack of coverage reflects the public's lack of interest in the topic. The story illustrates how people define news in the age of television. First of all, the public appears uninterested in whether or not the president is lying. The subject isn't entertaining or amusing.

Additionally, most of Reagan's "misstatements" are not outright lies but contradictions, or statements that deny earlier ones he made. The statements cannot both be true in the same context. To recognize a contradiction in what someone says, the listener needs a context for the information. But the discourse of television lacks context. Instead, it presents fragmented events. Viewers don't connect two events to each other. They're so used to this absence of context that they don't recognize a difference between "what the President says _now_ and what he said _then_." There's no continuity between "now" and "then."

Unlike in the 20th-century British writer [George Orwell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/key-figure-analysis/#George_Orwell)'s dystopia _1984_, the press is not censored or deliberately packaging lies as truth. No information has been hidden from the public. Instead, the public has become "adjusted to incoherence and amused into indifference," as British writer [Aldous Huxley](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/key-figure-analysis/#Aldous_Huxley) predicted in _Brave New World_.

Other media are taking cues from television's model. The popular newspaper _USA Today_ keeps stories short and relies heavily on images, charts, and graphs. Paragraphs, not extended stories, are the most common unit of print news. Magazines increasingly cover television celebrities. Even radio relies less on complex language and more on sound bites. Postman compares the modern news landscape to the game of Trivial Pursuit, which "uses facts as a source of amusement."

## Analysis

The ellipsis, or series of three dots, in the chapter title is a punctuation mark suggesting tension in written text. It indicates a distance between what came before the ellipsis and what comes after it. An ellipsis keeps readers waiting. [Postman](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/author/) suggests its equivalent in television is newscasters' rapid transitions from one topic to the next. The ellipsis keeps audiences on the hook; it's one more way for them to be entertained. But it keeps audience and newscasters from giving any topics serious thought. Postman uses the ellipsis to show how television has warped language into an instrument of confusion, not comprehension.

He argues that people need a sequence to ground them in reality. They need some sense of cause and effect or some understanding of why events are happening and how these events might influence the future. No one can understand a world where discrete or individual events don't connect to one another. Postman thinks this world would resemble absurdist theater, a genre designed to baffle audiences by presenting a nonsensical world on stage.

Similarly, the format of television is designed to keep viewers engaged even at the cost of disorienting or bewildering them. The news, for instance, offers the promise of another event to watch even if viewers didn't understand the first one.

In fact, television creates its own version of reality. This creation includes the selection of newscasters, who are performers required to play roles. They're actors first and newscasters second, Postman suggests. And the skills needed to act are different from the skills needed to deliver essential information. A performer's main job is to make the audience believe they embody a character.

This is where Postman gets into the tricky topic of how television alters viewer definitions of truth. In an extreme example, viewers wouldn't believe news reports were true if they didn't like how the newscaster looked. Postman knows this probably isn't the case. The effect is more subliminal. For instance, people might be more skeptical of a news report if they don't find the newscaster accessible or engaging. Or they'll be more trusting of a reporter who projects a warm, friendly image. Viewers may engage in this bias without realizing they're doing so.

The implications point in a disturbing direction for evolving definitions of truth and trustworthiness. They also make audiences vulnerable to attacking the individual making the argument, not the argument itself. President Richard Nixon (1913–94) and Socrates in Chapter 2, both on trial, failed to give the right kind of performance. Their actual innocence or guilt became secondary.

Other factors put viewers at a distance from televised events. Postman compares reported events to "scenes in a play." Music comforts the audience, lulling them into a sense they're seeing fictional events unfold with no real stakes. Stories are so short that the newscasters don't have time to explain what they mean. Programs rely on the instant emotional impact of pictures. Commercial sponsorship diverts interest and erodes viewer trust.

The newscaster takes on the role of a storyteller. The performance becomes part of the story itself. Audiences will take their reaction cues from the teller of the tale. If the newscaster demonstrates a combination of enthusiasm and detachment, the public will respond in the same way. Newscasters also model satisfaction in the completeness of their story. Viewers might not fully engage with or understand the story, but they will think they have. Thus, they won't be likely to seek further civic education.

Moral issues are at work too. Young people will see topics such as global cruelty and death presented with minimal attention. They may internalize the idea the topics are not serious. When Postman compares television to philosophical nihilism, or the rejection of moral principles, he worries the parade of images will desensitize viewers to suffering.

His larger concern is more subtle. For people to understand their present world, Postman believes they need to understand the past. And this understanding requires a sense of narrative—people should see how events connect to one another. Only then can they grapple with an event's significance and understand its relevance to their lives. They can also see themselves and their communities as part of a larger social and cultural history.

Television deprives audiences of this narrative. A commercial interruption, for instance, may be necessary for a television station to earn money. But Postman argues commercials take viewers out of their place as spectators to an unfolding story. Instead, commercials treat viewers as consumers whose job is to buy products. Viewers might understandably be confused about what story they are being told and how they should respond.

In fact, Postman compares television to art forms designed to baffle. Dadaism, the artistic movement he references, emerged as an embrace of anarchy and nonsense. The theater genre of vaudeville, his final comparison, involves several unrelated and comically absurd theatrical performances. Vaudeville was designed not to make sense.

The inconsistencies in Reagan's remarks further demonstrate the importance of a continuous narrative. To Postman consistency shows integrity and confidence in a political platform, something to expect from a world leader such as Reagan. People may still expect the president to tell the truth. They may not, however, view consistency as essential to honesty any longer. Without the ability to connect a politician's past statements to his future statements, people might lose interest in holding their leaders accountable.

The claim that Americans are the "least-informed people in the Western world" may seem hyperbolic, or exaggerated. But Postman's point is the contrast between the massive volume of information available and the difficulty of truly understanding this information in a television-centered culture. The more news people hear or see, the less they truly know. For instance, television may not be good at explaining ideas, but it is great at soliciting emotions. When people offer their opinions on current events to polltakers, they may think they know the facts. But in truth they might just feel strongly one way or the other.

Giving the public "the illusion of knowing something" endangers them more than outright lies. Postman compares "disinformation" to the techniques of the KGB, or Soviet security agency, which deliberately misled the public. In this case, though, people have no sense they are not being told the whole truth.

When people think of altered truth from an authority, they may think of British writer [George Orwell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/key-figure-analysis/#George_Orwell)'s dystopia _1984_. The totalitarian government in _1984_ used Newspeak, deliberately ambiguous language designed to manipulate citizens' sense of reality. But a weapon used in writer [Aldous Huxley](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/key-figure-analysis/#Aldous_Huxley)'s _Brave New World_ can do just as much damage. The leaders of _Brave New World_ drug the population with soma, a feel-good narcotic that puts them in a chemical haze. Postman describes them as indifferent to world events and inconsistencies from public leaders—just like the American public.

People are also no longer willing to do the work of critical observation in any medium. Postman admits short-form content isn't less likely to be nuanced or thoughtful than long-form content. But shorter content often requires less effort from the reader. Graphs and charts do most of the analysis already. Postman questions how much modern readers are willing to understand even when the information is right in front of them.

# Part 2, Chapter 8 : Shuffle Off to Bethlehem | Summary

## Summary

[Postman](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/author/) begins the chapter by describing the shows of three popular television evangelists: Reverend Terry offers viewers advice on how to earn more money, preacher Pat Robertson (b. 1930) provides entertaining "docu-dramas" where people are converted onscreen, and Jimmy Swaggart (b. 1935) presents emotional, comforting sermons ideal for television. Postman draws two conclusions. First, television presents religion as entertainment. It eliminates any sacred and ritualistic aspects of faith and highlights the preacher instead of the deity. Second, the medium and bias of television itself weaken any religious expression.

Religious programming attempts to translate worship from a service to a television screen. But the translation, Postman maintains, doesn't work. Something significant is lost, and the new product becomes something else entirely. When the delivery changes, the message must change with it. Here Postman disagrees with prominent evangelists such as Robertson and Billy Graham, who believe television is an ideal medium to convert followers. Television can't provide a genuine religious experience for several reasons. Programs lack the consecrated and sacred physical space required for a religious service. Viewers who are used to seeing secular advertisements and profanity on television may find it hard to absorb a thoughtful, faith-based message from the same medium.

Televangelists compensate by spending a lot of money on religious shows. They hire handsome performers, build extravagant sets, and promote the shows heavily. Religious programs are designed to make the audience feel good. This desire seems to contradict the purpose of faiths such as Christianity, which make serious demands of their followers.

Postman distinguishes between the visual spectacle of many religious rituals and the performance of religion on television. Faith-based rituals are designed to enchant, giving a sense of magic and sacredness. Entertainment rituals are designed to distance viewers from the sacred. Furthermore, even nonritualistic faiths such as fundamentalist Christianity don't translate well to the screen. Instead of promoting a deity, they promote a preacher as a celebrity.

What about the millions of viewers and potential converts religious programming can reach? Postman quotes German American philosopher Hannah Arendt's warning against teaching great literature as an enjoyable diversion. Arendt questions whether the value and message of many literary works will "survive an entertaining version of what they have to say." Postman has the same question about religious traditions. He worries television's adaptation of religion will destroy the authenticity and cultural relevance of faith.

## Analysis

The chapter title combines "Shuffle Off to Buffalo," a song title from a 1933 musical, and Bethlehem, a town with religious meaning in the Christian tradition. [Postman](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/author/) deliberately merges the casual and the sacred. The title hints Americans approach television-based religion through a nonchalant "shuffle."

The portmanteau _televangelists_ suggests an entirely new genre of evangelists, or religious leaders who seek converts—those who preach on television. Televangelists Reverend Terry, Pat Robertson, and Jimmy Swaggart all seem to counter traditional approaches to faith on their shows. Terry links religious practice to prosperity and cheer. Robertson makes conversions public experiences performed for an audience, while Swaggart gives sermons designed to pacify any viewer who tunes in. Postman notes Robertson's 700 Club promises "[a]ll this and more ... tomorrow" with the same ellipsis used in Chapter 7's title, "Now ... this." Each ellipsis offers a promise of brand new content without a connecting narrative.

Postman picks religion, primarily Christianity, to examine because of its important role in American cultural life. He recognizes not every reader will be religious. But he plans to demonstrate how any institution with a purpose beyond entertainment will find this purpose corrupted on television.

Religious practitioners need a sense of tradition, including historical models of how to practice their faith. Television focuses on fleeting images without establishing a larger narrative. Any faith requires a foundation, or doctrine of belief, which in turn requires an explanation. Television by its nature doesn't explain its contents.

Furthermore, Postman indicates the profound, mysterious experience of religion requires a more intimate setting than television. Religion is one of many ways for people to encounter something sacred about the human experience. Poetry, music, art, and many other human activities can similarly help people transcend everyday concerns, connecting to themselves and others. Postman believes these activities are essential to the human spirit. But he thinks they require a certain mindset to experience properly. The physical space of worship, for instance, is central to religion. The space in which someone encounters a message affects how they receive the message. Postman observes television has already intruded into spaces formerly reserved for community and family, such as the kitchen in a home.

The flow of information affects how people receive a message as well. Chapter 7 established how television often places radically different images together in a jarring way. A disturbing news broadcast may be followed by a cheery commercial. With so much information, it is difficult to focus on a single aspect, let alone contemplate what it means.

In the case of religious services, the medium changes the nature of the audience. Postman is critical of faith leaders who turn congregants into performance audiences. Billy Graham, one of the best-known Christian evangelists in the United States, was particularly influential in getting preachers to take advantage of new media.

Though congregants and performance audiences may consist of similar people, leaders interact with the two groups in different ways. Congregants hear a message or practice a ritual—they aren't there to be entertained. But performance audiences have different expectations. Preachers offer them spectacle and wealth to keep them watching. If audiences continue to see faith and wealth in the same context, they may treat wealth with the same reverence they give to faith.

Television is also dominated by what and who people can see, not what they can't. Postman identifies the situational irony of human newscasters and preachers—made performers by the television medium—tackling large, abstract topics such as God and the universe. The topic may be something invisible intended to inspire wonder and enchantment. But audiences are honoring a human public figure, the presenter, instead. The "golden calf" Postman mentions was a gold statue the biblical Hebrews worshipped in place of God. The phrase "golden calf" has come to mean anything a worshipper uses to replace a deity.

By focusing on the visible instead of the invisible, television removes the sense of mystery from religion. Postman, like many other thinkers, believes contemplation and wonder are fundamental to the human experience. When people can see everything they're seeking on television, they may lose the inclination to seek at all.

The quote from German American philosopher Hannah Arendt (1906–75) points out some aspects of culture are designed for solemn encounters. English playwright William Shakespeare's (1564–1616) play _Hamlet_ is a tragedy. Yom Kippur is a religious fast of repentance in the Jewish tradition. Making these experiences entertaining would destroy their essence—almost eliminating the experience as it was intended. This erosion of all culture into amusement is what Postman describes as "culture-death" in Chapter 11.

# Part 2, Chapter 9 : Reach Out and Elect Someone | Summary

## Summary

Does politics resemble sports or show business? Sports encourage players to follow rules and pursue excellence. Show business aims to please an audience, and it strives for the appearance of excellence. Good advertising replaces true skill. [Postman](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/author/) states, "the fundamental metaphor for [American] political discourse is the television commercial," suggesting politics has become show business.

First, Postman discusses the commercial's effect on discourse and commerce. Commercials threaten capitalism, an economic system based on profit and private ownership and the dominant system in the United States. Capitalism emerged from the 18th-century Enlightenment, which prized rationality and knowledge. A capitalist system assumes buyers are mature enough to make smart decisions about the products they want to purchase. Sellers need to provide quality goods and tell the truth about what they are selling. They should provide enough information for the consumer to make a rational decision.

Modern commercials don't let consumers make these decisions. First of all, commercials use images as a substitute for language. Without language, commercials cannot make "true" or "false" propositions about a product's features. Instead, commercials sell a dramatic fantasy of happy people enjoying the product. They speak to "the fears, fancies and dreams" of potential consumers. The creators of commercials don't research facts about products. They research the people who might buy them.

Television commercials have also shaped how politicians present their ideas to the public. They've done so through two methods. First, political candidates are required to make commercials, and these commercials favor the candidate who offers a certain image of themselves. Second, commercials make certain assumptions about communication. A commercial is brief and demonstrates easy solutions to problems. It often delivers a "pseudo-parable"—a simple, dramatic, emotional story with a moral, and it employs visual symbols so viewers can understand quickly.

Viewers may have unconscious expectations when they see a political commercial. They may expect simple language, swift solutions, and theatrical performances from the candidates, and they may resist any complex arguments. Furthermore, they see politicians not as experts in a field but as celebrities. The public watches celebrities for amusement and considers them part of the show business world.

Politicians know they're expected to entertain. Candidates began seeking television appearances as early as the 1950s. By the 1980s local, state, and national candidates appeared on television shows constantly. As the "politician-as-celebrity" has risen, the importance of political parties has declined. To Postman this indicates people no longer vote according to their economic and political beliefs. Instead, they vote for individual candidates they like.

How do candidates cultivate an image? Postman argues a candidate in the age of show business will "offer himself as an image of the audience." He references the Bell Telephone advertisement slogan "Reach Out and Touch Someone"—from which Postman took the chapter title, "Reach Out and Elect Someone." The Bell advertisements promise intimacy and family togetherness across long distances. The slogan does not give information about a product or company but does appeal to emotional desires in the consumer.

Great television commercials offer "a slogan, a symbol, or a focus" through which the viewer can see themselves reflected in a positive light. Political commercials do the same. Voters are less likely to select candidates whose policies will improve their lives. They pick candidates whose charm and warmth make them feel good about themselves.

Just as "image politics" makes policy less relevant, it ignores the importance of history. Print-based discourse presents history as a conversation, with patterns from the past informing the present. The image-based discourse of television discards the past completely. Everything on television is happening _right now_. As a result, viewers become "unfit to remember" the past—they have no context for it. Television makes them live in the perpetual present moment. According to the "Electric Plug"—Postman's phrase to describe the television—history doesn't exist.

Next, Postman imagines how the "politics of image, instancy, and therapy" affects freedom of information in America. Many readers feared the totalitarian state in British writer [George Orwell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/key-figure-analysis/#George_Orwell)'s _1984_, where the government banned books and destroyed records of the past. But surrounding the public with entertainment, as British writer [Aldous Huxley](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/key-figure-analysis/#Aldous_Huxley) describes in _Brave New World_, is just as effective a way to make history disappear.

Orwell imagined Western governments threatening democracy by banning printed material. Past rulers have often censored written communication. The U.S. Constitution's Bill of Rights ensures the government can't restrict information or ideas. But television presents a different danger to freedom of information and thought. It surrounds people with irrelevant but entertaining material to watch. If people watch television instead of reading books, there's no need to ban books. If their entertainment is simple, they won't engage in critical thinking. To Postman this is the best situation a tyrannical government could hope for: a country where "the masses ignore that which does not amuse."

## Analysis

The early Americans of Chapter 3 were influenced by a best-selling pamphlet, writer Thomas Paine's _Common Sense_. The ideas in the pamphlet helped spark a political revolution. Television can also determine the direction of liberal democracy in a new age. The medium influences how Americans select their leaders and the government under which they will live; the stakes are high.

His initial comparisons determine politics has more in common with show business than it does with sports. The main goal is to please the crowd. He cites a book titled _The Selling of the President_ that suggests picking leadership is like picking a consumer good.

When [Postman](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/author/) was writing in 1985, the television commercial was among the primary ways consumer goods and services were advertised. His argument about commercials being anti-capitalist may seem counterintuitive. Capitalism is an economic system driven by private profit from the buying and selling of goods and services. Commercials aim to get buyers. Aren't these goals the same? But in Postman's view, commercials defy an assumption central to capitalism. For a capitalist system to work, the market needs informed buyers to create healthy competition. Many sellers can promote products. But the best product, the one that serves its purpose most effectively at a price consumers are willing to pay, comes out on top. Consumers have enough accurate information to decide what the best product is.

Late 20th-century television commercials didn't focus on product information. Consumers found it harder to compare and contrast different options and select the best one. They had no argument to convince them. Chapters 4 and 5 established that while words can make claims, images cannot. Television commercials are image-based. They can't appeal to reason, but they can appeal to immediate need. They actively create a need for a product to fill an emotional void so that the product, regardless of its quality, will sell.

Postman goes as far as calling television commercials a mythology of their own. Mythologies function as cultural attempts to explain the world and people's place in it. Like commercials, they appeal to deep longings and fears. Myths become part of the natural environment; no one questions their place in the world.

Most importantly to Postman's argument, people see themselves reflected in television commercials. Market research zeroes in on "what is wrong about the buyer" to manipulate potential consumers. A commercial may use images to assure viewers their lives will improve if they buy the product.

The political commercial can make similar claims, promising people's lives will get better if they support a candidate. But for people to see their own anxieties and hopes reflected in a politician, they need a blank slate. An image of a friendly face can interest any voter. Specific explanations of a candidate's views might hinder voters' ability to see a reflection of themselves.

Postman says this new marketplace represents a change from traditional economic thought. Adam Smith (1723–90), the Scottish philosopher whose work formed much of Western economic philosophy, thought in terms of capital, labor, and markets. He didn't think of emotions. The word _commercial_ comes from the root word _commerce_, meaning "buying and selling." The meaning of the word changed with the medium of television.

The implications for politics also demonstrates a television-centered change. British writer [George Orwell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/key-figure-analysis/#George_Orwell) expresses concerns about deceptive politicians in his dystopian novel _1984_ and his essay "Politics and the English Language." The totalitarian state in _1984_ practiced what Orwell calls doublethink, the belief in two contradictory ideas at the same time. The state used slogans such as "[w]ar is peace" and "[i]gnorance is strength" to eliminate the traditional meaning of each word.

Politicians don't need a drastic strategy such as doublethink to deceive the public, Postman thinks. Chapter 7 demonstrated Americans didn't notice if President Ronald Reagan believed two contradictory ideas at once—they had already moved on. Postman's concerns are different. He fears a politician will defend the indefensible and no one will care. This means national leaders may be able to get away with atrocities with no resistance from the public. People will stop expecting excellence from their government leaders.

Changing voter expectations of politicians may have other consequences for American democracy. Rather than competitions between two political parties—the original intention of the two-party system—elections became personal battles between two individuals. And commercials primed voters to anticipate easy solutions from their elected leaders, just like the 20-second solutions they see in commercials. But problems in politics take much longer to solve. Postman anticipates two major results of these changes. First, political parties and the ideas they represent may become less relevant. Voters won't select a policy platform; they'll select a personality. Secondly, leaders may be pressured to provide short-term but ineffective fixes.

Commercials also assume a posture of moral authority through parables, which are brief stories with instructions on how people should live their lives. It's old content adapted to a new form. The biblical figure of Jesus is famous for parables. Postman believes the form always changes the content, however. Televised parables suggest people should look to the screen for the right thing to do, not consult their own experiences and beliefs.

With solutions readily available, people may reject more difficult thinking techniques required for the democratic process to work. Voters may not care which candidate represents their personal values or proposes an effective solution to problems. They might not give the campaign enough attention and could end up voting against their own best interest as a result.

When Postman discusses politicians as celebrities, he refers to the elevated place celebrities occupy in the American imagination. Celebrities function as role models. People may admire a celebrity or support a politician whose lifestyle mirrors the life they want themselves. Celebrities rely on the approval of the public to maintain their status. A politician in a democracy is especially at the mercy of public goodwill; they have to be voted into office.

Postman indicates a successful campaign would model the emotional appeal of the "Reach Out and Touch Someone" Bell Telephone slogan. This brief slogan also demonstrates how the phone—as a medium, not as a technology—represents intimacy and connection over long distances. _Reach_ and _touch_ are action verbs promising reunification, contact, and love. Negative emotions such as loneliness and estrangement also come into play. The phone is offered as a quick fix or a substitute for a genuine human need. Postman replaces _touch_ with _elect_ in the chapter title, hinting a political candidate could triumph with a similar slogan playing on similar emotions.

When Americans vote based on their feelings, Postman thinks they miss the point. To think seriously about a candidate's policies, a voters need a historical perspective. They should have some idea which policies worked in the past and might work in the future. This mindset requires Americans to see the past as "more than nostalgia" and as a world they can learn from constantly. Remembering past mistakes ensures these mistakes won't be repeated.

To Postman a television-centered cultural landscape doesn't provide any reason to see patterns in historical events. History is seen as the province of books—distant and irrelevant to the present time. But if history disappears from the collective imagination, the loss could be incalculable.

Orwell imagined the loss of history too. One way to oppress a culture is to destroy its historical records, erasing the culture's tradition and sense of self. Censorship of threatening ideas is another way to cut off culture at the knees. Orwell's _1984_ portrayed a more traditional form of government oppression that totalitarian leaders used throughout history: purging written documents and limiting free speech.

But censorship is only effective when information and ideas threaten the existing order of power. For information to hold a power of its own, it needs the potential to influence the public. If no one is reading books, why would the government bother to censor texts? If viewers are enjoying what the "corporate state" has to offer— financial support for television programs —why would they challenge the state? Postman quotes Hungarian American journalist George Gerbner's (1919–2005) reference to the "Ministry of Culture," language taken from the four ministries of Orwell's _1984_. These ministries were government agencies supposedly promoting love, truth, peace, and plenty but in fact promoting the exact opposite.

The three major television networks running in the 1980s didn't conspire to create a ministry of culture. Americans simply give them this power in a gradual development no one has resisted. The new battle for liberty, according to Postman, will be getting Americans to care about information and history again. Then they can decide their own fates and build the country they want to see.

It surrounds people with irrelevant but entertaining material to watch. If people watch television instead of reading books, there's no need to ban books. If their entertainment is simple, they won't engage in critical thinking. To Postman this is the best situation a tyrannical government could hope for: a country where "the masses ignore that which does not amuse."

## Analysis

The early Americans of Chapter 3 were influenced by a best-selling pamphlet, writer Thomas Paine's _Common Sense_. The ideas in the pamphlet helped spark a political revolution. Television can also determine the direction of liberal democracy in a new age. The medium influences how Americans select their leaders and the government under which they will live; the stakes are high.

His initial comparisons determine politics has more in common with show business than it does with sports. The main goal is to please the crowd. He cites a book titled _The Selling of the President_ that suggests picking leadership is like picking a consumer good.

When [Postman](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/author/) was writing in 1985, the television commercial was among the primary ways consumer goods and services were advertised. His argument about commercials being anti-capitalist may seem counterintuitive. Capitalism is an economic system driven by private profit from the buying and selling of goods and services. Commercials aim to get buyers. Aren't these goals the same? But in Postman's view, commercials defy an assumption central to capitalism. For a capitalist system to work, the market needs informed buyers to create healthy competition. Many sellers can promote products. But the best product, the one that serves its purpose most effectively at a price consumers are willing to pay, comes out on top. Consumers have enough accurate information to decide what the best product is.

Late 20th-century television commercials didn't focus on product information. Consumers found it harder to compare and contrast different options and select the best one. They had no argument to convince them. Chapters 4 and 5 established that while words can make claims, images cannot. Television commercials are image-based. They can't appeal to reason, but they can appeal to immediate need. They actively create a need for a product to fill an emotional void so that the product, regardless of its quality, will sell.

Postman goes as far as calling television commercials a mythology of their own. Mythologies function as cultural attempts to explain the world and people's place in it. Like commercials, they appeal to deep longings and fears. Myths become part of the natural environment; no one questions their place in the world.

Most importantly to Postman's argument, people see themselves reflected in television commercials. Market research zeroes in on "what is wrong about the buyer" to manipulate potential consumers. A commercial may use images to assure viewers their lives will improve if they buy the product.

The political commercial can make similar claims, promising people's lives will get better if they support a candidate. But for people to see their own anxieties and hopes reflected in a politician, they need a blank slate. An image of a friendly face can interest any voter. Specific explanations of a candidate's views might hinder voters' ability to see a reflection of themselves.

Postman says this new marketplace represents a change from traditional economic thought. Adam Smith (1723–90), the Scottish philosopher whose work formed much of Western economic philosophy, thought in terms of capital, labor, and markets. He didn't think of emotions. The word _commercial_ comes from the root word _commerce_, meaning "buying and selling." The meaning of the word changed with the medium of television.

The implications for politics also demonstrates a television-centered change. British writer [George Orwell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/key-figure-analysis/#George_Orwell) expresses concerns about deceptive politicians in his dystopian novel _1984_ and his essay "Politics and the English Language." The totalitarian state in _1984_ practiced what Orwell calls doublethink, the belief in two contradictory ideas at the same time. The state used slogans such as "[w]ar is peace" and "[i]gnorance is strength" to eliminate the traditional meaning of each word.

Politicians don't need a drastic strategy such as doublethink to deceive the public, Postman thinks. Chapter 7 demonstrated Americans didn't notice if President Ronald Reagan believed two contradictory ideas at once—they had already moved on. Postman's concerns are different. He fears a politician will defend the indefensible and no one will care. This means national leaders may be able to get away with atrocities with no resistance from the public. People will stop expecting excellence from their government leaders.

Changing voter expectations of politicians may have other consequences for American democracy. Rather than competitions between two political parties—the original intention of the two-party system—elections became personal battles between two individuals. And commercials primed voters to anticipate easy solutions from their elected leaders, just like the 20-second solutions they see in commercials. But problems in politics take much longer to solve. Postman anticipates two major results of these changes. First, political parties and the ideas they represent may become less relevant. Voters won't select a policy platform; they'll select a personality. Secondly, leaders may be pressured to provide short-term but ineffective fixes.

Commercials also assume a posture of moral authority through parables, which are brief stories with instructions on how people should live their lives. It's old content adapted to a new form. The biblical figure of Jesus is famous for parables. Postman believes the form always changes the content, however. Televised parables suggest people should look to the screen for the right thing to do, not consult their own experiences and beliefs.

With solutions readily available, people may reject more difficult thinking techniques required for the democratic process to work. Voters may not care which candidate represents their personal values or proposes an effective solution to problems. They might not give the campaign enough attention and could end up voting against their own best interest as a result.

When Postman discusses politicians as celebrities, he refers to the elevated place celebrities occupy in the American imagination. Celebrities function as role models. People may admire a celebrity or support a politician whose lifestyle mirrors the life they want themselves. Celebrities rely on the approval of the public to maintain their status. A politician in a democracy is especially at the mercy of public goodwill; they have to be voted into office.

Postman indicates a successful campaign would model the emotional appeal of the "Reach Out and Touch Someone" Bell Telephone slogan. This brief slogan also demonstrates how the phone—as a medium, not as a technology—represents intimacy and connection over long distances. _Reach_ and _touch_ are action verbs promising reunification, contact, and love. Negative emotions such as loneliness and estrangement also come into play. The phone is offered as a quick fix or a substitute for a genuine human need. Postman replaces _touch_ with _elect_ in the chapter title, hinting a political candidate could triumph with a similar slogan playing on similar emotions.

When Americans vote based on their feelings, Postman thinks they miss the point. To think seriously about a candidate's policies, a voters need a historical perspective. They should have some idea which policies worked in the past and might work in the future. This mindset requires Americans to see the past as "more than nostalgia" and as a world they can learn from constantly. Remembering past mistakes ensures these mistakes won't be repeated.

To Postman a television-centered cultural landscape doesn't provide any reason to see patterns in historical events. History is seen as the province of books—distant and irrelevant to the present time. But if history disappears from the collective imagination, the loss could be incalculable.

Orwell imagined the loss of history too. One way to oppress a culture is to destroy its historical records, erasing the culture's tradition and sense of self. Censorship of threatening ideas is another way to cut off culture at the knees. Orwell's _1984_ portrayed a more traditional form of government oppression that totalitarian leaders used throughout history: purging written documents and limiting free speech.

But censorship is only effective when information and ideas threaten the existing order of power. For information to hold a power of its own, it needs the potential to influence the public. If no one is reading books, why would the government bother to censor texts? If viewers are enjoying what the "corporate state" has to offer— financial support for television programs —why would they challenge the state? Postman quotes Hungarian American journalist George Gerbner's (1919–2005) reference to the "Ministry of Culture," language taken from the four ministries of Orwell's _1984_. These ministries were government agencies supposedly promoting love, truth, peace, and plenty but in fact promoting the exact opposite.

The three major television networks running in the 1980s didn't conspire to create a ministry of culture. Americans simply give them this power in a gradual development no one has resisted. The new battle for liberty, according to Postman, will be getting Americans to care about information and history again. Then they can decide their own fates and build the country they want to see.

 People will come to love their oppression. 

Narrator, [Foreword](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/foreword-summary/)

Postman fears a television-saturated American culture will result in a dystopia similar to writer Aldous Huxley's _Brave New World_. The citizens of Huxley's imaginary state don't think for themselves or get much choice in how they live their lives. But they don't complain because the state distracts them with endless amusements. Though the citizens are content, they have lost the capacity for critical thinking—and their rulers make decisions for them.

Postman worries Americans' love for the easy entertainment of technology will lead to a similar lack of freedom. He believes it is easy for leaders to take civil liberties away from people who do not care.

 The concept of truth is intimately linked to the biases of forms of expression. 


Narrator, [Part 1, Chapter 2](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/part-1-chapter-2-summary/)

Is the meaning of truth timeless and universal? Or does it change based on a culture's preferred form of communication? Each new medium alters the truths its users are willing to accept, Postman proposes. Print-based cultures, for instance, may trust the authenticity of the written word over the spoken word, even if the content is the same.

3.

 Form will determine the nature of content. 


Narrator, [Part 1, Chapter 3](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/part-1-chapter-3-summary/)

This claim drives the central thesis of the book. Postman believes television is destroying American discourse because of its form, not its content. Written words require readers to analyze their meaning, while spoken words require listeners to pay attention. Yet, images only ask viewers to observe. The forms privilege different uses of the brain and lend themselves to different types of content naturally.

4.

 Words ... assemble a context in which the question, Is this true or false? is relevant. 


Narrator, [Part 1, Chapter 4](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/part-1-chapter-4-summary/)

Not everything written in print is true or trustworthy. But words always make a claim of some sort. Print asks the reader to think within the logical framework of truth or falsehood. This framework encourages readers to see the world as an understandable place with order and meaning. When advertisers make claims using words, for instance, potential buyers have the power to determine whether the claims are accurate or not.

5.

 Exposition is a mode of thought, a method of learning, and a means of expression. 


Narrator, [Part 1, Chapter 4](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/part-1-chapter-4-summary/)

Exposition or descriptive explanation is more than a literary technique to Postman—it is an entire worldview. Exposition in learning requires students to build on previous skills for understanding. Exposition in thought implies a reasoned, logical decision-making process, while exposition in expression means making a claim with thoughtful evidence to back it up.

6.

 The telegraph demands that we burn its contents. 


Narrator, [Part 1, Chapter 5](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/part-1-chapter-5-summary/)

The word _demands_ implies the telegraph, like all media, has its own bias or agenda. This bias is based on how the viewer encounters the media. The telegraph's purpose is to deliver temporary messages, making room for more messages to come. The contents of the messages do not build on previous messages or explain upcoming exchanges. They come with no sense of history or continuity for the reader, and they are not intended for readers in the future. Once telegraphs became commonplace, Postman suggests, people got used to receiving information in instant, quickly discarded packages. This prepared them for the rise of television.

7.

 Television does not extend or amplify literate culture. It attacks it. 


Narrator, [Part 2, Chapter 6](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/part-2-chapter-6-summary/)

This quote challenges the idea that television and literature can share dominant space in the American cultural landscape. The word _attacks_ suggests television's worldview is directly opposed to the worldview of literate or print-based culture. Television threatens to make reading irrelevant. It fulfills nearly all the purposes people once used reading for: news, education, and imaginative entertainment. At the same time, it discourages the patient, analytical thought processes reading encourages.

8.

 How television stages the world becomes the model for how the world is properly to be staged. 


Narrator, [Part 2, Chapter 6](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/part-2-chapter-6-summary/)

Postman often compares media environments to biological environments. Just as organisms adapt to their surroundings, humans adapt to their media. Television's primary goal is to entertain. Americans in the late 20th century, immersed in a world where most of their information came from television, strived to make life more entertaining in all areas. They prioritized image over substance and contentment over learning as a result.

9.

 What shall we do if we take ignorance to be knowledge? 


Narrator, [Part 2, Chapter 7](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/part-2-chapter-7-summary/)

Modern-day Americans can access a dazzling amount of information on a variety of topics. But Postman questions how helpful, accurate, and complete the information they get from televised news can be. He fears Americans absorb random, disconnected facts and fragments of full stories and then feel they are well informed. But knowledge requires both breadth and depth, which Americans don't often get from image-based media. Postman worries the American definition of knowledge will change so much that consumers won't be able to recognize misinformation.

10.

 Commercials ... provide a slogan ... that creates for viewers a comprehensive and compelling image of themselves. 


Narrator, [Part 2, Chapter 9](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/part-2-chapter-9-summary/)

What are commercials really selling? Postman's analysis concludes that commercials are never really about the advertised product. Instead, they provide what viewers want to see—a lifestyle fantasy they covet, an easy answer to a problem they face, or a remedy for their insecurities. The political commercial requires politicians to similarly mirror the desires of potential voters rather than advance a policy agenda. Political advertisements, like product advertisements, manipulate buyers and voters into making a decision that may not be in their best interest.

11.

 With television, we vault ourselves into a continuous, incoherent present. 


Narrator, [Part 2, Chapter 9](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/part-2-chapter-9-summary/)

In order for people to maintain their cultural identity and move toward meaningful progress as a society, they have to remember their collective past. Postman sees television as actively destructive to memory. The nature of the medium means one image is quickly replaced by another image. When people are accustomed to seeing the world represented this way, they may get used to looking forward rather than backward. They can fail to notice that patterns develop over time—and then repeat the same historical mistakes.

12.

 Censorship is not a necessity when all political discourse takes the form of jest. 


Narrator, [Part 2, Chapter 9](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/part-2-chapter-9-summary/)

Authoritarian governments often censor books or other media to prevent citizens from exchanging ideas. But they only do so when these ideas have cultural power. Most censored communication challenges existing authority. There is no reason for people to challenge an authority they find enjoyable and nonthreatening. If citizens are entertained by their politicians, they don't consider the ways politicians might try to help or harm them. They don't take their government seriously and are less likely to speak out against abuses of power.

13.

 Spiritual devastation is more likely to come from an enemy with a smiling face. 


Narrator, [Part 2, Chapter 11](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/part-2-chapter-11-summary/)

The phrase "spiritual devastation" indicates the destruction of something essential to the human spirit. Postman imagines a future United States where community, art, faith, education, history, imagination, and other aspects of culture hold less value to citizens. He also recognizes if a threat to liberty has "a smiling face" or seems appealing and positive, people will not recognize the threat.

Television is designed to be enjoyable, but if people rely on it too much, they lose autonomy and freedom of choice.

14.

 Technology is ideology. 


Narrator, [Part 2, Chapter 11](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/part-2-chapter-11-summary/)

This quote suggests each new technology embodies a series of values and ideals. These ideals become clear once people begin to use the technology. An image-centered communication tool, for instance, teaches people to interpret the world through pictures. They may soon respect images more than they respect words. The quote encourages the reader to consider what other values a particular technology encourages.

15.

 No medium is excessively dangerous if its users understand what its dangers are. 


Narrator, [Part 2, Chapter 11](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Amusing-Ourselves-to-Death-Public-Discourse-in-the-Age-of-Show-Business/part-2-chapter-11-summary/)

Though Postman feels television promotes a dangerous worldview, he knows readers cannot turn off the medium permanently. The technology has already saturated the culture. Instead, he urges readers to be informed viewers who question what they see on the screen. He believes humans should control technology rather than letting technology control them. And this control requires healthy skepticism rather than complete reverence toward new media.

# Neil Postman | Biography

### Early Life and Schooling

Educator and media scholar Neil Postman is best remembered for his insight into how mass communication affects individuals and communities. A native New Yorker, he was born in Brooklyn on March 8, 1931, into a Yiddish-speaking family. He got on a teaching track early, earning degrees from the State University of New York at Fredonia in 1953 and Teachers College at Columbia University in 1958.

Soon afterward he was hired at the New York University (NYU) School of Education, where he would spend most of his career. He eventually chaired the university's department of culture and communication. In 1971 he founded a media ecology program to study how media shapes human thought, behavior, and culture. Much of Postman's work warned about television and its potential damage to public discourse.

### Studies in Education

Along with his media studies, Postman stayed actively involved in improving education. At the beginning of his career, he spent time teaching in elementary and secondary schools. His early texts proposed new theories of education, including _Teaching as a Subversive Activity_ (1969) and _Teaching as a Conserving Activity_ (1979). In _The Disappearance of Childhood_ (1982) he claimed the concept of childhood developed as the printing press encouraged literacy. The evolution of television, a medium anyone could watch, immersed children in adult conflicts and made childhood "disappear" again. _The End of Education: Redefining the Value of School_ (1995) advocated an emphasis on diversity, global citizenship, and intellectual inquiry in schools.

### Media Theory and _Amusing Ourselves to Death_

_The Disappearance of Childhood_ (1982) expresses Postman's concern about the negative effects of television on young people. _Amusing Ourselves to Death_: _Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business_ (1985) furthers his analysis of the medium, revealing how television and other media shape thought patterns and social rituals. Postman compares media environments to biological environments. When new media evolves, such as the written alphabet or the printing press, the surrounding culture evolves as well.

_Amusing Ourselves to Death_ is an argument about how television diminishes the quality of public conversation. As his starting point, Postman uses British writer Aldous Huxley's 1932 dystopian novel _Brave New World_, where citizens are pacified by entertainment and lose the ability to govern themselves. No media is neutral, Postman argues. Every new technology favors certain forms of information over others. As an image-based medium, television is biased toward quick and trivial impressions, discouraging complex thought as a result.

The book expresses particular concern about television's tendency to make serious topics amusing. A 1983 televised discussion about the possibility of nuclear war, for instance, featured several knowledgeable participants. But their discussion lacked the counterarguments and explanations necessary for a debate, because television doesn't favor complex verbal discourse. Since "television demands a performing art," as Postman says in Chapter 6, panel participants had to perform a certain role to keep viewers' attention.

### Legacy of Curiosity

Postman's work as a cultural critic highlighted the many ways metaphor gives form to experience. Language intrigued him as a tool to understand the present and decipher the past. Postman was known for applying a poet's curiosity to his work. He grappled with language's relationship to technology in _Conscientious Objections: Stirring Up Trouble About Language, Technology__,_ _and Education_ (1988). He explored how people and social institutions revere technology without considering its negative implications in his 1992 _Technopoly: the Surrender of Culture to Technolog__y_. In this work Postman goes so far as to describe what he calls "technopoly, or the deification of technology, which results in social institutions and practices surrendering their sovereignty to technology."

When he died on October 5, 2003, from lung cancer, Neil Postman left a legacy of intellectual exploration and engaged teaching. He researched widely in media and education with over 200 articles and 20 books to his name. But Postman is best remembered for his critiques of mass media and its impact on human development.
