## What are Aztecs?

The Aztecs appeared in Mesoamerica around the beginning of the 13th century, most likely as a [nomadic](https://askanydifference.com/difference-between-nomad-and-nomadic/ "nomadic") tribe from northern Mexico.

The Aztec folk’s beginnings are unknown, but they have been thought to have originated as a northern tribe of hunter-gatherers named after their native land, Aztlan, which means “White Land” in the Aztec dialect of Nahuatl.

The Aztecs also were considered as the Tenochca (through which the identity of their country’s capital, Tenochtitlan, was inferred) or the Mexica (through which the initials of their provincial capital, Tenochtitlan, were abstracted).

Their emergence occurred shortly after the Toltecs, the previously dominant Mesoamerican culture, fell or may be aided in the fall of the Toltecs.

## What are Incas?

The Incas are best known for founding the Inca Empire in pre-Columbian America, which lasted from 1438 to 1533 and was centred in what became Peru. It was the pinnacle of the Inca civilization.

The Inca Empire, which was centred on the Andean mountain range, used conquering and peaceful internalization to integrate the region of contemporary Peru, followed by a massive component of western South America, into their imperial power. 

The final Sapa Inca (emperor) of the Inca Empire was caught and executed on the instructions of the conquistador Francisco Pizarro soon just after Inca Civil War, signalled the beginning of Japanese rule.

The empire’s remains fled to Vilcabamba’s isolated jungles, where they founded the little Neo-Inca State, which was defeated by the Spanish in 1572.
