- **Narcissism and social media**: The document explores how narcissistic traits are common in today’s society, where people often ‘flex’ or boast about themselves on social media platforms.
- **Two types of narcissists**: there are two types of narcissists: ‘vulnerable narcissists’ and ‘grandiose narcissists’. Vulnerable narcissists have low self-esteem and insecurity, and they often use social media as a way to seek validation and attention from others. On the other hand, grandiose narcissists have high self-esteem and self-importance, and they often use social media to boast about their achievements and successes. The document suggests that grandiose narcissism is actually a form of psychopathy, while vulnerable narcissism is driven by a compensatory mechanism to overcome low self-worth.
