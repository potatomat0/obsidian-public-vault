## Definition

Tructuralism is a school of thought that emerged in the mid-20th century that seeks to understand the underlying structures that govern human thought, culture, and society. It is based on the belief that all phenomena can be understood as part of a larger system, and that the meaning of any individual element is determined by its relationship to the other elements in the system.

Structuralism has its roots in the work of Ferdinand de Saussure, a Swiss linguist who argued that language is a system of signs that are defined by their relationship to each other, rather than by their inherent meaning. Saussure's ideas were later adopted by other thinkers, such as Claude Lévi-Strauss, a French anthropologist who applied structuralist methods to the study of myth, kinship, and other cultural phenomena.

Structuralism has had a profound impact on many different fields, including philosophy, anthropology, linguistics, literary criticism, and psychology. In philosophy, structuralism has been used to analyze the nature of knowledge, the self, and the relationship between language and thought. In anthropology, structuralism has been used to study the structure of kinship systems, myths, and other cultural phenomena. In linguistics, structuralism has been used to analyze the structure of language, including the relationship between phonemes, morphemes, and sentences. In literary criticism, structuralism has been used to analyze the structure of texts, including the relationship between characters, plot, and setting.

Structuralism has been criticized for being too deterministic and for ignoring the role of human agency in shaping the world. However, it has also been praised for its insights into the nature of human thought and culture.

The connection between structuralism and postmodernism is complex and contested. Some scholars argue that structuralism is a precursor to postmodernism, while others argue that they are fundamentally different. However, there are some similarities between the two schools of thought. For example, both structuralism and postmodernism reject the idea of a single, objective reality. They also both emphasize the importance of language and culture in shaping our understanding of the world.

Ultimately, the relationship between structuralism and postmodernism is a matter of debate. However, there is no doubt that structuralism has had a significant impact on the development of postmodern thought.
