_____
- **Brain ripples and memory**: A group of scientists found patterns of ripples that synchronize across the human brain during spontaneous waking and memory recall. These ripples may generate memory and conscious experience.
- **The soft problem of consciousness**: The quest to identify the physical processes in the brain that underpin mental events. Brain ripples may be the first observed mechanism that could potentially solve this problem.
- **Binding-through-synchrony hypothesis**: A theory of consciousness that postulates that a synchronization of neural activity is what organizes different sensory cues from different regions of the cortex into coherent experience. Brain ripples are the first observable and testable mechanism that could corroborate this hypothesis.
- **Decentralized consciousness**: The idea that consciousness may not have a center, or a fixed unifying organ controlling it, but rather a distributed and dynamic phenomenon that is coordinated by brain ripples.
