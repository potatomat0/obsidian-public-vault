Postmodernist mass media humor is a type of humor that is characterized by its **use of irony, pastiche, and subversion**. It often challenges traditional notions of what is considered funny, and it can be used to critique social and political norms.

Some examples of postmodernist mass media humor include:

- The satirical TV show The Daily Show, which uses irony and parody to comment on current events.
- The animated sitcom The Simpsons, which often features absurdist humor and metafictional elements.
- The films of Quentin Tarantino, which often blend different genres and play with audience expectations.

Postmodernist mass media humor can be seen as a way of negotiating the uncertainty and ambiguity of the postmodern world. It can also be seen as a way of challenging the power of the media and the dominant cultural order.

Here are some of the key features of postmodernist mass media humor:

- **Irony:** Postmodernist humor often relies on irony, which is a form of verbal humor that relies on a contrast between what is said and what is meant. For example, a postmodernist joke might make a statement that is literally true but that also has a hidden meaning that contradicts the literal meaning.
- **Pastiche:** Postmodernist humor often uses pastiche, which is a form of imitation that combines elements from different sources. For example, a postmodernist TV show might blend different genres, such as comedy and drama, or it might use historical figures in a fictional setting.
- **Subversion:** Postmodernist humor often subverts expectations, which means that it challenges the way that we think about things. For example, a postmodernist joke might end in a way that is unexpected or that challenges our assumptions about the world.

Postmodernist mass media humor can be a powerful tool for social and political critique. It can be used to challenge the status quo, to expose hypocrisy, and to make us think about the world in new ways. However, it is important to note that postmodernist humor is not always easy to understand, and it can sometimes be offensive to some people.

## vs postmodern theories 

Postmodernist mass media humor is related to postmodernism theories in a number of ways. First, both postmodernist humor and postmodernism theories challenge traditional notions of what is considered true or real. Second, both postmodernist humor and postmodernism theories use irony, pastiche, and subversion as tools of critique. Third, both postmodernist humor and postmodernism theories are concerned with the relationship between language and power.

However, it is important to note that postmodernist mass media humor is not simply a reflection of postmodernism theories. It is a unique form of humor that has its own history and development. It is also a form of humor that can be enjoyed by people who do not necessarily subscribe to postmodernist theories.
