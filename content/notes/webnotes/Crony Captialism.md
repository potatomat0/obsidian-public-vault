Crony capitalism is a form of capitalism in which businesses thrive not as a result of free enterprise, but rather as a return on money amassed through collusion between a business class and the political class. This collusion can take many forms, such as:

- Government officials granting special favors to businesses in exchange for campaign contributions or other forms of political support.
- Businesses using their political influence to pass laws or regulations that benefit them at the expense of their competitors.
- Businesses using their political influence to block or delay the enforcement of laws or regulations that would harm them.

Crony capitalism differs from traditional capitalism in that it is not based on the free market. In a free market, businesses compete on their own merits, and the most successful businesses are those that provide the best products or services at the lowest prices. In a crony capitalist system, businesses that are well-connected to the political class can gain an unfair advantage over their competitors, even if they are not providing the best products or services.

The negative effects of crony capitalism on society include:

- Increased inequality: Crony capitalism allows businesses with political connections to amass wealth at the expense of their competitors, which can lead to increased inequality in society.
- Reduced economic growth: Crony capitalism can stifle economic growth by discouraging competition and innovation.
- Corruption: Crony capitalism can lead to corruption, as businesses and government officials use their positions to enrich themselves at the expense of the public.

Some of the main critics of crony capitalism include:

- Economists: Economists argue that crony capitalism is inefficient and can lead to economic stagnation.
- Politicians: Politicians who believe in free markets and limited government often criticize crony capitalism.
- Activists: Activists who fight for social justice often criticize crony capitalism for its role in increasing inequality.

Some examples of crony capitalism include:

- The Enron scandal, in which Enron executives used their political connections to gain favorable treatment from the government.
- The subprime mortgage crisis, in which banks and other financial institutions were able to profit from risky lending practices because they were protected from the consequences by government bailouts.
- The current state of the US healthcare system, in which pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies have a great deal of political influence, which allows them to charge high prices and extract profits from patients.

Crony capitalism is a serious problem that can have a negative impact on society. It is important to be aware of the signs of crony capitalism and to take steps to fight it.
