Neo-Marxism is a broad term that refers to a variety of schools of thought that have developed out of Marxism since the early 20th century. Neo-Marxists generally agree with the basic tenets of Marxism, such as the idea that class conflict is the driving force of history and that capitalism is an exploitative system. However, they also disagree with some of Marx's ideas, and they have developed new theories and concepts.

Some of the main differences between neo-Marxists and Marxists include:

- **Neo-Marxists are more likely to emphasize the role of culture and ideology in shaping society.** They argue that Marx's focus on economics was too narrow, and that they need to take into account the role of culture and ideology in order to understand how society works.
- **Neo-Marxists are more likely to be critical of the Soviet Union and other communist states.** They argue that these states did not achieve true communism, and that they were often oppressive and authoritarian.
- **Neo-Marxists are more likely to be interested in developing new theories and concepts.** They have developed new theories about the state, ideology, and culture, and they have also been influenced by other schools of thought, such as post-modernism and feminism.

Some examples of neo-Marxists include:

- **Antonio Gramsci:** Gramsci was an Italian Marxist theorist who developed the concept of hegemony. He argued that the ruling class maintains its power not only through force, but also through the control of culture and ideology.
    
- **Herbert Marcuse:** Marcuse was a German-American philosopher who developed the concept of "repressive tolerance." He argued that the ruling class uses tolerance to suppress dissent and to maintain its power.
    
- **Frantz Fanon:** Fanon was a Martinique-born psychiatrist and revolutionary who developed the concept of "anti-colonial consciousness." He argued that colonized people need to develop a sense of their own identity and culture in order to overthrow colonial rule.
    

Neo-Marxists and Marxists disagree on a number of issues, including:

- **The role of culture and ideology:** Neo-Marxists argue that culture and ideology are important factors in shaping society, while Marxists argue that economics is the primary driving force of history.
- **The Soviet Union and other communist states:** Neo-Marxists are more critical of the Soviet Union and other communist states, while Marxists argue that these states were a step in the right direction.
- **The possibility of achieving communism:** Neo-Marxists are more skeptical about the possibility of achieving communism, while Marxists believe that it is a realistic goal.
