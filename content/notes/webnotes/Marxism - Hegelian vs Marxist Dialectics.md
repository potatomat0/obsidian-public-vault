- **Materialism vs. Idealism:** Hegelian dialectics is an idealist philosophy, which means that it emphasizes the role of ideas in the development of the world. Marx and Engels, on the other hand, were materialists, which means that they believed that the material world is the primary reality. As a result, Marx's dialectic is based on the material conditions of society, such as the mode of production and the relations of production.
- **Trinitarian vs. Binary:** Hegelian dialectics is a trinitarian process, which means that it involves three stages: thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. Marx's dialectic, on the other hand, is a binary process, which means that it involves two stages: thesis and antithesis. The synthesis is not a separate stage in Marx's dialectic, but rather the result of the conflict between the thesis and antithesis.
- **Progress vs. Revolution:** Hegelian dialectics is a progressive process, which means that it is always moving towards a higher state of development. Marx's dialectic, on the other hand, is a revolutionary process, which means that it is characterized by conflict and change. Marx believed that the dialectical process would eventually lead to the overthrow of capitalism and the establishment of communism.

In summary, Marx's dialectic is a materialist, binary, and revolutionary process that is based on the material conditions of society. Hegelian dialectics, on the other hand, is an idealist, trinitarian, and progressive process that is based on the development of ideas.

Here is a table that summarizes the key differences between Marxian and Hegelian dialectics:

|Feature|Marxian Dialectics|Hegelian Dialectics|
