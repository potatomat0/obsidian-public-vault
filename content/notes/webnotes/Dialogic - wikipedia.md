_____
**Dialogic** refers to the use of conversation or shared dialogue to explore the meaning of something. (This is as opposed to monologic which refers to one entity with all the information simply giving it to others without exploration and clarification of meaning through discussion.) The word dialogic relates to or is characterized by dialogue and its use. A dialogic is communication presented in the form of dialogue. Dialogic processes refer to implied meaning in words uttered by a speaker and interpreted by a listener. Dialogic works carry on a continual dialogue that includes interaction with previous information presented. The term is used to describe concepts in literary theory and analysis as well as in philosophy.

Along with _[dialogism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue_(Bakhtin) "Dialogue (Bakhtin)")_, the term can refer to concepts used in the work of Russian philosopher [Mikhail Bakhtin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Bakhtin "Mikhail Bakhtin"), especially the texts _[Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problems_of_Dostoevsky%27s_Poetics "Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics")_ and _[The Dialogic Imagination: Four Essays by M.M. Bakhtin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dialogic_Imagination:_Four_Essays_by_M.M._Bakhtin "The Dialogic Imagination: Four Essays by M.M. Bakhtin")_
