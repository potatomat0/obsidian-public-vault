### At a Glance

One of the most influential documents in modern history, _The Communist Manifesto_ is simultaneously a theoretical treatise, a political program, and a revolutionary call to arms. Its purpose was to serve as the primary political document for the newly formed Communist League, an international party that was established in London in 1947. However, Karl Marx, the primary author, used the document to do even more. Most significantly it is a call for "workers of the world" to unite to overthrow the bourgeois (middle class) social order, for in the proletarian (working class) revolution, the workers have "nothing to lose but their chains." The _Manifesto_ states that the exploitation of the many by the few is unjust and that the proletariat has a historic role to fulfill in bringing about the era of communism, thus ending class struggle.

_The Communist Manifesto_ also lays out some fundamental principles of Marxist philosophy, including the following:

- **historical materialism****:** the theory that class and material factors shape history
- **alienation****:** the theory that workers are distanced from their products, their labor, and themselves
- **class struggle****:** the theory that workers' and capitalists' interests are permanently antagonistic
- **base-superstructure****:** the theory that the economic base of society determines its political, ideological, and cultural "superstructure"

### Perspective and Narrator

_The Communist Manifesto_ is written in the present tense.

### About the Title

Originally titled _Manifesto of the Communist Party_, written in its original German, _The Communist Manifesto_ is the main political creed of the Communist League, a revolutionary political party whose members were, for the most part, German and English workers and intellectuals. _The Communist Manifesto_ spells out the continuing issues of class struggle and the doctrines of communism—an ideology whose followers believe the capitalist system (in which private owners control production of goods) is harmful and should be overthrown.

# Main Ideas

## Capitalism, Workers, and Class Struggle

The most significant ideas from _The Communist_ _Manifesto_ are Karl Marx's class analysis of society and critique of capitalist democracy. Indeed, for a work with _Communist_ in the title, there is little written about what a communist society would look like or do. Instead, Marx focuses on the problems of bourgeois society, on bourgeois politics, and on the influence of class on every level of politics and history.

Perhaps the most significant insight, and one of the most frequently cited concepts, is that the "history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles." It is hard to overstate how radical an insight this was at the time, and continues to be. For Marx, the problems of European politics and history, the failures of the revolutions, and the disappointments of Enlightenment ideals were explained by a single frame of analysis: class. The Enlightenment revolutions, such as the one in France in 1789, were not primarily about the ideas of liberalism; slogans such as "liberty, equality, and fraternity" from French revolutionaries were more about class. The ideals of the revolutionaries were merely expressions of class interests that helped facilitate the revolutionary overthrow of monarchical power, according to Marx. This insight, placing class over and above ideas or ideals, is one of Marx's most famous and most influential principles.

Marx also explores how class operates within capitalist societies. For him, an inevitable and permanent "antagonism" exists between classes in a capitalist society and forms a basic two-class model for the division of society. The bourgeoisie own the means of production and use their wealth and ownership to accumulate more capital, while the proletariat have only their labor to sell and are thus forced to rent themselves under threat of starvation. While the bourgeoisie seek to increase profits by cutting wages and making people work harder, the proletariat want to earn higher wages and can do so only through cutting into profits. This is the source of the class conflict in a capitalist society and an irreconcilable conflict that will end only with the overthrow of capitalism. Although _The Communist Manifesto_ hints at other classes and at complications of this basic picture, those ideas are not explored. The reader is left with the broad outlines of class theory, with details obscured and questions unanswered about the scope, veracity, and explanatory power of the theory.

## Historical Materialism

Another significant insight of Marxist theory is the notion of "historical materialism." This term does not appear in _The_ _Communist_ _Manifesto_, and Marx himself used "materialist conception of history" in his other writings. Nonetheless, historical materialism is the guiding framework for the pamphlet; Marx's short account of the rise of the bourgeoisie is a clear example of its application. For Marx, to understand the course of political and social history, one needs to understand the motor force of history: class and economics. Marx argues that although ideas, ideology, and politics often appear to be major factors, they in fact reflect only the material conditions whose changes are what fundamentally drive history. For example, the "bourgeois revolutions" of the 18th century, Marx argues, were actually class revolutions that brought the new bourgeois class to power, rather than revolutions driven by the new egalitarian ideas of the Enlightenment. Marx further states that these ideas are merely a reflection of class interests. That is, ideas do not self-generate, replicate, and propagate according to some internal logic of the ideas themselves; rather, they are based on their relationship to material interests (specifically class interests) and the larger material constitution of society. In fact, Marx affirms that "the ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of its ruling class."

Related to this notion is Marx's concept of "base and superstructure" to explain social phenomena and social change. Marx believed material, or economic, factors at the base of society shape and determine the "superstructure" at the top, such as ideology, culture, and law. For Marx, this was a "scientific" insight. In some of his writings it resembles a deterministic relationship in which the material base defines and determines the ideological superstructure. In fact, culture and ideas also shape the base, giving a particular form or limit on how the economic structure functions. Thus, it is more accurate to say there is a codeterminative relationship between base and superstructure. Yet for Marx, the relationship looks more one-directional: the base is what matters in finding explanations for the course of history.

## Proletarian Revolution, Communism, and Role of the State

Much of Marx's work takes the form of critique, challenging the assumptions and reality of capitalism; _The Communist Manifesto_ is no exception. However, in _The Manifesto_, Marx does put forward some notions of a positive program of what communism would look like and how to achieve it. Central to that vision is the notion of the proletarian revolution, a climactic struggle to seize the means of production, nationalize capital, and create a working-class government. Here, Marxist notions of the state are crucial to understanding this vision.

For Marx and subsequent Marxists, the state is an implement of class power, or "class violence" in his language. Under capitalism its function is to support and defend the interests of property and capital, the bourgeoisie, and not much more. So when it comes to bringing about communism, it is hard for Marx and others to see how the bourgeois state could be used successfully to construct an egalitarian order; therefore, violent revolution against the state is necessary. However, other formulations in _The_ _Communist_ _Manifesto_ contradict this idea_._ For example, in the final section, Marx has communist parties participating in bourgeois parliamentary elections, and it is not clear how these strategies coalesce. Furthermore, because Marx sees the state as a neutral implement of class power, workers could construct a "workers' state." This would simply implement the egalitarian interests of the proletariat and gradually lead to a communist society. However, Marx and the Marxist tradition have taken significant criticism for an underdeveloped theory of the state. These critics argue that rather than a neutral class implement, the state is its own source of power, with its own objectives that can be at odds with the "ruling class," whether bourgeois or proletarian. Thus, many have questioned the state-centered vision of revolution and a communist society, and Marx provides few answers to these critiques.

And what about communism? Marx has little to say. _The Communist_ _Manifesto_ does spell out some specific policies communists would take should they win state power (whether through electoral or revolutionary means is unclear). These include steps such as nationalizing capital in public banks, centralizing the control of transit and communication, and redistributing rents. But this is hardly a vision of the free and egalitarian society promised by communism. How to get there from these admittedly incremental steps? _The_ _Manifesto_ leaves these questions unanswered.

# Context

The 19th century was a tumultuous time, and the publication of _The Communist Manifesto_ in the middle of the century speaks to this general upheaval. In particular, three social contexts are important to understand _The Manifesto_: the growth of industrial capitalism and the limitations of 18th-century Enlightenment-era revolutions that took place during a period of intellectual upheaval, the birth of workers' movements for socialism and reform, and the intellectual history of European philosophy.

## Industrialization and Inequality in the Modern Era

By the time _The Communist Manifesto_ was published in 1848, the impact of the industrial revolution on workers and wage earners was clear. The development of a German railroad system had created new demand for steel and coal, which in turn increased production of these commodities. Numerous works of literature, philosophy, and social science addressed the harmful effects of factory production on workers and the negative health and social effects of poverty and social disempowerment. For example, the account of workers' living standards published by Friedrich Engels ([Karl Marx](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Communist-Manifesto/author/)'s collaborator) in 1844, titled _The Condition of the Working Class in England_, shows how the industrial revolution worsened rather than improved the social conditions of England's working poor. Engels focused on increased disease and mortality rates, lower incomes, and poor living conditions. These circumstances found a literary outlet in the works of authors such as British novelist Charles Dickens, who wrote about poverty and the effects of industrialization. Known as the "social question," these problems left many wondering why workers were still so poor when industrial capitalism was producing great wealth and material richness.

Another complication arose from the nature of modern political democracies. These poor economic conditions came on the heels of the era of European revolutions, especially in France, which were founded on notions of universal emancipation and universal political rights. Yet by the mid-19th century, the promises of the revolutions had not improved the conditions of the populace, and further revolutions spread throughout Europe. As many social philosophers and thinkers sought to understand what was happening and why, _The Communist_ _Manifesto_ and other writings offered a bold and, in some ways, compelling interpretation.

Marx's answer to these conundrums was that both the process of industrialism and the failures of the revolutions stemmed from class divisions within society. According to Marx, the revolutions in Europe were "bourgeois revolutions." They benefited the rich who fought to gain political power over the remains of feudalism, the system in which aristocrats profited from the labor of peasants in exchange for military protection.

This political power did not trickle down to the poor, who now were facing deteriorating conditions and worsening exploitation under industrial capitalism. Therefore, Marx argued that industrialization, too, was a class phenomenon. Wealth went to the top, while the workers, not the owners, actually produced the wealth. In this analysis, Marx was trying to give a new revolutionary interpretation to the major political and economic issues of the day.

## Mid-century Socialism in the Age of Revolutions

Marx was not alone in the quest to find answers to the biggest social questions. Indeed, workers also were asking these questions and seeking answers. For many the answers lay in reform movements, such as limiting the workday to 10 hours, or extending voting rights beyond property qualifications to enable workers to vote or run for office in bourgeois governments. However, others saw these essentially political solutions as unsatisfactory because they ignored the fundamental source of workers' problems: capitalism. A critique of capitalist relations of production, of property, of market exchange, and of worker exploitation came from many quarters, and vibrant anticapitalist workers' movements began. At the core of these movements was socialism, the idea that workers should democratically control the processes of industrial manufacture and capitalist wealth-creation rather than be controlled by it. Some key insights of the growing movement were the following:

- All wealth was generated by workers; therefore, profits for owners were a form of exploitation.
- Private property, especially ownership of factories and means of production, was a kind of unjustified rent that should be abolished.
- Wages were exploitative and should likely be abolished.

Marx took these ideas, among others, and brought them together to help solidify the core of socialist philosophy. He also added some notions of his own, which have since become core socialist tenets.

More than asking questions and developing ideas, workers also began to take action. Through organizing unions, reform movements, street protests, riots, and rebellions, workers demonstrated their opposition to the emerging order of capitalist society. Some sought immediate redress, whereas others advocated transformational or revolutionary change. Occasionally, these outbursts would take on revolutionary dimensions as they did in 1848, when a wave of revolutionary movements swept Europe, toppled monarchies, and sought greater democratic reforms. In France, the revolution deposed reigning monarch Louis Philippe I, leading the way to the establishment of the Second Republic. Revolutionary movements swept through other countries as well, including Italy, the German states and Berlin, and Denmark. In this climate, it is not hard to see how Marx and others would have believed that the success of a revolutionary workers' movement was inevitable.

During this time, democratic, liberal, workers', and revolutionary movements all faced severe state repression, forcing many to go underground. Marx and others faced exile, trials, and jail time for their activities and associations with revolutionary groups. One such underground group was the League of the Just, a socialist revolutionary organization that held clandestine meetings and issued publications and whose members were Marx's comrades and allies. This group, along with others, decided to become a public political party so it could organize on a mass scale. The result was the new Communist League, the group that tasked Marx with drafting its manifesto: the open, widely distributed statement explaining the League's politics and ideas. Chief among these, in addition to opposition to bourgeois society as laid out in the document, was the call for a worldwide workers' revolution to end private property and nationalize capital. The political, economic, and social goals of the Communist League were among the most radical and systematic of the socialists'.

## Enlightenment Philosophy and Hegelianism

In addition to his revolutionary proclivities and activism in workers' movements, Marx was above all a philosopher and a product of the Enlightenment, the intellectual and cultural movement that championed reason and scientific inquiry over religious faith. The traditions of Enlightenment political philosophy and that of German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel weigh heavily on his ideas. But Marx was also a sharp critic of both the Enlightenment and Hegelianism, rejecting central tenets of both traditions while striving to develop a philosophy more suited for the modern world.

For Marx, the Enlightenment principles that gave rise to the revolutions of the 18th century were little more than class interests masked as universal principles. Therefore, when revolutionaries in France or the United States called for free speech or universal rights, Marx argued these rights merely served their class interests in the struggle against monarchy and autocratic governments. Revolutionaries wanted these rights because they allowed greater maneuverability in their efforts to establish trade, develop manufacturing, and ultimately seize political power for themselves. To gain such power, they needed to seize the state and transform it to serve their interests; to enable them to do so meant limiting the power of the state to interfere in their private affairs, particularly with business and property. Marx was thus ready to condemn all rights as "bourgeois rights," reflecting values of bourgeois society—values including the exploitation and dehumanization of the working class. Indeed, for Marx much of society was shaped and defined by class, and although Enlightenment principles might seem like noble ideals, they in fact hid an uglier reality.

The leading philosophical figure in the formative period of Marx's youth was Hegel, an eclectic philosopher who developed his ideas in the aftermath of the French Revolution and the ascendency of Enlightenment principles. In many ways he sought to explain the revolutions, both in ideals and in politics, through what he called a dialectic synthesis of the countervailing "spirit" of the age. In short, Hegel argued that each moment and every thing contains both itself and its opposite (its thesis and antithesis) and that times of revolutionary transformation results from the synthesis of these two contrasting features, which makes something new.

This was Hegel's dialectic, a term describing a method of philosophical argument that includes a dialogue presenting opposing viewpoints. Marx saw potential insight to be gleaned from the dialectic method of argument. In particular, Marx took the dialectic and applied it to the history of revolutions in Europe. According to Marx, the feudal order (the thesis) produced its own antithesis (revolutionary bourgeois class) that then produced a synthesis of old and new in capitalism and "bourgeois society." Where Marx differed with Hegel was in understanding the motor force of these changes. For Hegel, the history of change was ultimately a reflection of the "spirit," or idealized form, of any particular moment or thing. Marx found this idea too abstract; wanting a more concrete answer, he saw class, or economic and material forces, as the ultimate driver of history.

# Brief Summary

## Summary

_The Communist Manifesto_ was written to promote the Communist League, a revolutionary communist party based mostly in Germany and England in the mid-19th century. _The_ _Manifesto_, however, is much more than a political party platform; [Karl Marx](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Communist-Manifesto/author/) uses it as an opportunity to develop his theories about the nature of capitalist society and as a startling call for a revolutionary movement to overthrow the bourgeois order.

### Introduction

With the specter of communism "haunting Europe," and entrenched powers of "old Europe" trying to downplay or eliminate the communistic threat, it is time for members of the Communist League to unite and make their views known. The manifesto, sketched out by an international group of communists at a meeting in London, is to be published in major European languages.

### Section 1: Bourgeois and Proletarians

_The Communist Manifesto_ begins with an account of history and the rise of the bourgeois class, the owners of capital and the means of production. The bourgeoisie arose from a unique combination of declining feudal society and growing trade and exchange that resulted from the European conquests around the globe. Although members of the bourgeois class were born of feudalism, their wealth derived from exchange and production; they were a new class that bucked the "fetters" of the feudal order, the social and political restraints of monarchy and aristocracy. Hence the "democratic" revolutions of the 18th century were really "bourgeois revolutions" to construct the modern "bourgeois society." This is an order based on the exploitation and alienation of another new class, the proletariat: the people who work for wages and occupy the bottom rung of society. Much as the feudal order produced the seeds of its destruction in the revolutionary class of the bourgeoisie, so the capitalist order is creating its destruction in the revolutionary proletariat. This class struggle has to advance through stages, but ultimately and "inevitably," it will result in the proletarian revolution, communism, and an end to class-driven society.

### Section 2: Proletarians and Communists

The Communist Party offers to the working class a universal, multinational movement that can heighten the class struggle and help bring about the revolution. Karl Marx dispels some myths about communism, claiming bourgeois critiques are rooted in class interests and social positions and, as such, reflect ruling class, not universal, values. The communists' primary goal is to abolish all private property. To do this, they advocate revolutionary seizure of the state, which can act to repress the interests of the bourgeoisie and construct specific programs, such as the democratic control of capital through the state, to undo class social relations.

### Section 3: Socialist and Communist Literature

Marx takes to task the "false" socialists—those who do not posit revolutionary struggle and believe instead in the ultimate harmony of class interests, and in achieving goals through peaceful political means or the establishment of communes. He identifies three strands of faulty socialism: reactionary socialism (fighting against the rise of the bourgeoisie and industrialism); conservative or bourgeois socialism (seeking to address social grievances to perpetuate the bourgeoisie); and "critical-utopian" socialism (successfully criticizing society but not offering practical reforms). Pitted against them is the Marxist version, which he calls real or "scientific" socialism, based on perpetual class struggle.

### Section 4: Position of the Communists in Relation to the Various Existing Opposition Parties

Marx claims that communists attempt to advance the movements for "immediate aims," but they also keep in mind the "future of the movement." Thus, Communist Party members ally with other parties for these reasons. In France, they ally with the Social Democrats; in Switzerland, they support the Radicals; and in Poland, they push for agrarian revolution. In Germany, communists ally with the bourgeoisie when such an alliance may further the imminent bourgeois revolution, to be followed by a "proletarian revolution." Communists support revolutionary struggle of all kinds as attacks on the established order, advocating the "overthrow of all existing social conditions" because they believe "the proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains." The revolutionary workers' movements must unite across national lines to overthrow the bourgeois system and free themselves of its exploitation.

# Introduction | Summary

## Summary

_The Manifesto of the Communist Party_ (_The Communist Manifesto_'s original title) begins, "A specter is haunting Europe—the specter of Communism." Although many in politics bandy about the term "communism" as an insult, few know what communism is or stands for. It is time to clear the air and for communists to make their views known. _The Manifesto_ represents the open face of communists, representing numerous European countries, who met in London and enumerated their positions and ideas.

## Analysis

Although brief, the introduction establishes the very vocal and visible presence of the Communist League as a distinct threat to the established order. Influential European leaders recognize the movement, and although they regard it with disdain, they would prefer it not exist at all. The mention of spies indicates that league activities are likely being monitored, infiltration may be taking place, and police are receiving information about membership and actions. That the document is to be published in six languages indicates it will be available in industrial European nations—England, France, Germany, Belgium, Italy, and Denmark—with a sizable working class and active communist groups.

# Section 1 : Bourgeois and Proletarians | Summary

## Summary

[Karl Marx](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Communist-Manifesto/author/) explores the communist ideas of history and social change, arguing that "the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles." In recorded history, from ancient to modern times, class divisions define the political content of the era, and the change in class composition defines the progress of history through various epochs. Class conflict also marks the modern era, "the epoch of the bourgeoisie"; the conflict now exists between new classes—the bourgeoisie and the proletariat—and it has "simplified the class antagonisms" between just two major classes.

The feudal order gave rise to industrial capitalism and the new revolutionary class, the bourgeoisie. Two phenomena combined to foster its emergence: political rights granted to burghers (the earliest townspeople, descending from serfs or "freemen" not tied to the land or other obligations) and wealth generated from global conquest, expanding markets, and trade. Colonization of the Americas and the resulting trade of goods generated new sources of wealth and dramatically transformed feudalism. The feudal system of manufacturing could not keep up with the changes, and the guild system of master artisans gave way to a division of labor, managed by the emerging "middle class." When the new manufacturing system became mechanized by steam power, productive capacity exploded, and the new industrial middle class gained power. These changes in modes of production correspond to the creation of the new class—the bourgeoisie—and making an important mark on the political history of modern Europe.

Throughout the centuries, the middle classes that populated medieval communes, free states, or urban republics also supported the monarchy as a bulwark against the interests of the noble classes. In the modern era, however, the bourgeoisie has gained control of the state, over which it has "exclusive political sway" and which serves to manage the "common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie."

The process and progress of the bourgeoisie is a history of revolutions; the bourgeoisie have "played a most revolutionary part," throwing feudal traditions into the "icy water of egotistical calculation." In particular, the bourgeoisie have reduced all forms of skilled labor to a wage relationship of "exploitation." Similarly, the family has been turned into "a mere money relation." Most important, the bourgeoisie have brought a constant revolution to the "instruments of production, and with them the whole relations of society." That is, technological change has exponentially grown with the industrial revolution, and with it, social transformation developed in lockstep. In the bourgeois era, "all that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned." The change is geographic, too, as the quest for new markets pushes the bourgeoisie all over the world. This globalization undoes nationalism, as new market forces push out, or undo, national industries, commodities, and knowledge. "New wants" are created for the globalized products. Even "the most barbarian" societies cannot resist new and cheaper products that, in turn, force the adoption of bourgeois methods and values. With these changes, the bourgeois create "a world after its own image."

The feudal order, particularly the "relations of property," were adverse to this new explosive force; "they became so many fetters" and had to be undone by the new productive forces and the new social class. Into that change came the modern era, based on free competition and the economic and political rules of the bourgeoisie. But these new forces resemble a sorcerer who can no longer control his spells. In particular, market competition leads to "commercial crises": economic depressions that paralyze industries. These are crises of "overproduction" in which a market cannot absorb a glut of product; the result is a dangerous market and social disorder that threatens property. The two possible solutions to overproduction are the destruction of the oversupply or the creation of new markets.

As the bourgeoisie took advantages of the crises caused by material changes in the feudal order, in the industrial era the relations of production are now creating a crisis for the bourgeoisie. In fact, the bourgeoisie have "forged the weapons that bring death to itself." The wielder of these weapons is "the modern working-class—the proletariats," born of the same conditions that produced the bourgeoisie. The proletariat class is defined by its relationship to production; proletarians work only so long as they contribute to capital, or as long as capital needs them, for without capital they have nothing. Thus, they are forced to sell themselves like a commodity, and "like every other article of commerce," they find themselves "exposed to all the vicissitudes of competition, to all the fluctuations of the market." Therefore, workers are "reduced to an appendage of the machine," with no control of themselves or their labor. With improvements to machinery, working conditions deteriorate, and individuals become interchangeable parts. Formerly independent classes (such as shopkeepers or artisans) sink into the proletariat in a race to the bottom.

Like the bourgeoisie, the proletariat, too, undergo stages of development. The proletarian "birth begins its struggle with the bourgeoisie." The first resistance is individual; it attacks the implements of manufacturing rather than the structures of production. At this stage, as workers begin to take collective action, they fight not the bourgeoisie but the "enemies of their enemy": the feudal order, which restrains them all. As industrial capitalism advances, the proletariat become more numerous and their conditions more universal. As capitalists struggle with competition and are forced to cut wages, workers begin to take collective action by forming unions, revolting, and rioting to improve wages and conditions. These struggles may make small gains, but the real ones come from the growth of unions as the fighting organs of the proletariat. Unionization centralizes the struggle and heightens tensions to a national stage. "Every class struggle is a political struggle," and workers turn toward party organizing and legislative action. In all these actions, the bourgeoisie assist the proletariat but use them in their own national or international squabbles and consequently pull the working class into the terrain of politics, which will be the bourgeoisie's undoing. As the class struggle advances toward its ultimate phase, a number of far-seeing bourgeoisie abandon their class and side with the revolutionary workers, much like what happened to the nobility in the era of bourgeois revolutions.

Because of these forces, only "the proletariat alone is a really revolutionary class." Other segments of the middle class (such as artisans, peasants, and shopkeepers) fight with the bourgeoisie to preserve their existence and are therefore conservative and cannot serve as the revolutionary agent. The very bottom of society, the "social scum," may be swept into a revolutionary movement, but will more likely be bribed as a reactionary tool. Yet for the individual proletarian, traditional custom and belief in family, law, religion, and morality have been stripped from him and now viewed with jaundiced vision as "bourgeois interests." It is therefore in their interest to do away with the entirety of the capitalist order. While previous revolutionary movements were led by minorities representing minority interests, for the first time in history the proletariat, in its movement to throw off the yoke of capitalism, represents the "interest of the immense majority." This struggle will likely take on a national character. While the bourgeoisie make their own "grave diggers," the ultimate victory of the proletariat is "inevitable."

## Analysis

In this dense and detailed section, [Karl Marx](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Communist-Manifesto/author/) lays out many of the fundamental principles of communism, including class struggle, the materialist concept of history, and the theories of alienation and exploitation of the proletariat.

First, Marx puts forward a basic two-class theory of society: workers and capitalists, or proletariat and bourgeoisie. Classes do not peaceably coexist; instead, they are engaged in conflict—the class struggle—which punctuates and defines the course of history. For the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, this struggle is defined by conflict over wages and profits. As capitalist competition brings economic downturns, employers are forced to cut wages, obviously harming the interests of workers. Marx says because of this situation, the proletariat is the only class that has the collective material interest of overturning the capitalist order, and thus can act for the benefit of all humanity, not merely their own class interests. In his words, "the proletariat, the lowest stratum of our present society, cannot stir, cannot raise itself up, without the whole superincumbent strata of official society being sprung into the air."

The proletariat has further reason to rise, according to Marx, because workers are "alienated" from their labor. Although the term "alienation" does not appear in _The Communist Manifesto_, the concept is a fundamental principle of his analysis of capitalism, developed in _Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844_ written a few years earlier. The basic idea is that workers in industrial capitalism are "alienated" from their labor because they work for wages. Working for wages means laborers have no interest in the product, don't see the benefit of its use or sale, and share no reward in profits. Instead, they are told what to do and how to do it, thus losing control of both the product of their labor and of themselves.

Marx claims alienation is a function of present class relations, but class struggle itself is the motor force of history. Elsewhere, this idea is called "the materialist conception of history," and after Marx's death it was shortened to "historical materialism." In this view, presented most succinctly in _The Communist Manifesto_, economic factors—the modes of production and the social relationship of class—develop in tandem and explain many features of political and social history. Marx uses the rise of the bourgeoisie as his chief example. Looking at the revolutions of the 18th century (such as those in France and the United States), Marx explains that the social upheavals of the era were driven not by Enlightenment ideals, such as the "natural rights of man" or notions of political equality, but by the emergent bourgeois class in its struggle for social supremacy as it came into conflict with the political and social "fetters" of feudalism and the aristocratic order. Thus, the revolutionary ideas of the Enlightenment developed to serve the class interests of the bourgeoisie and led the charge against the monarchy. This is another basic tenet of Marxism, introduced in _The Manifesto_ but fully developed elsewhere: the "base-superstructure" model of society. In it, the material factors at the economic base shape and determine features of the "superstructure": politics, ideology, and culture.

Marx is at his best in this explanation of history and the notion of class struggle and economic interpretations of history. His class analysis of European history and the rise of the bourgeoisie have changed the fields of history, political science, and sociology, and have provided new insights into literature and art as well. But Marx is not so strong in predicting as he is in his use of robust, definitive language about the "inevitable" and "ultimate" proletarian revolution that would not simply represent the next stage in the class struggle but instead would completely undo class relationships and lead to the liberation of all humankind. In both these aspects, Marx has been challenged as being perhaps too certain and utopian.

# Section 2 : Proletarians and Communists | Summary

## Summary

The Communist Party does not represent sectarian interests or political objectives separate from working-class politics as defined by the workers' objective position. Instead, communists work to advance the class struggle within nations and to unite the proletariat "independent of nationality." Communists, therefore, represent the "most advanced and resolute" layer of the working class and have a theoretical advantage "over the great mass of the proletariat" because they have a better understanding of the forces and the course of history guiding the workers' movement. The communists have the same aim as the working class and other working-class parties, namely the "formation of the proletariat into a class, overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy, [and] conquest of political power by the proletariat." These are not ideas imposed by some independent thinker but the result of the "actual relations" of society.

Communists' advocacy of the abolition of property is not unique to the party; indeed, history is dominated by changes in the relationship of property in society. During the French Revolution, for example, feudal property was abolished "in favor of bourgeois property." And the system of capitalist property is based "on class antagonisms" and on "the exploitation of the many by the few." Therefore, the communists favor abolishing bourgeois property, an idea that makes them unique. In fact, the theory and program of the communists can be summarized in the call for the "abolition of private property."

[Karl Marx](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Communist-Manifesto/author/) answers several questions about the abolition of property; specifically, whether the call to abolish private property will mean an end to personal possessions as "the fruit of a man's own labor." Marx states that the relations of artisanal production, in which workers are rewarded by position of the products of their labor, is already being abolished by wages and bourgeois property; workers receive wages but not the full "fruit of their labor." This type of labor produces only capital, a property relation that exploits the worker and is based on the "antagonism of capital and wage labor." Capitalist property relations mean that the capital created through collective labor becomes the sole property of the bourgeoisie. In effect, production and capital are already socialized, but property is defined by class ownership—not collective ownership—under bourgeois law. On the other hand, wages pay only the "minimum" to keep the worker alive. In this case, workers take personal possession of things to keep themselves going. This "personal appropriation" is the not the focus of communist abolitionist efforts. Instead, the communists want to reverse the bourgeois order of social priority; workers, or "living labor," exist to serve capital, or what Marx calls "accumulated labor." According to Marx, the communist society will use capital in the interest of workers, "to promote the existence of the laborer."

Bourgeois theorists fret that this transformation will mean the abolition of personal freedom, and they are correct if by liberty they mean the liberty of capital. Because bourgeois rights center on property, of "free selling and buying" and other "brave words" about freedom, these theorists fear the end of private property. But, according to Marx, property does not exist for 90 percent of the population; it is the reserve of the rich, and these relations should end. Critics claim that "individuality vanishes" with the loss of individual property. Communists counter by claiming that bourgeois property blocks access to the "products of society for all," and such propertied persons must be "swept out of the way," enabling all to appropriate property.

Countering the objection under communism that people will become lazy, Marx says capitalism rewards laziness and punishes workers; workers who make wealth "acquire nothing," while the rich accumulate great sums and "do not work." So, too, with culture, which critics fear will be destroyed under communism; however, only bourgeois culture, not culture in general, will succumb. And so, too, with law, which is not the law of justice "but the will of your class made into a law for all." These critics' mistakes stem from the misconception that historical and class interests and ideals are universal and eternal; when critiquing the feudal order for inequities, they cannot see the same processes playing out in their own era.

To the charge of communism eliminating the family, Marx says only the bourgeoisie exist as a family; others find it "absent," and therefore communists do advocate the abolition of the traditional bourgeois family. Communists also advocate ending child exploitation, rescuing "education from the influence of the ruling class." In fact, protests against the communist position are "all the more disgusting" while working-class children are forced into labor in factories, and families "torn asunder." To the charge of communism, making women communal property (stemming from the bourgeois notion of women as mere instruments of production), Marx explains that the goal of communism is to liberate women from the role of production and bourgeois sexual mores that lead to prostitution and adultery. Next, Marx addresses nationality, claiming communists do indeed want to abolish "countries and nations"; in fact, "working men have no country." Marx gives several reasons. Workers do not control the mechanisms of the state and are therefore not full parts of their countries. Moreover, because national antagonism stems from class interests, nations will cease to exist when classes are abolished.

Exploring why these objections to communism exist, Marx finds the ideas produced by a society reflect its material order, which has a class character: "The ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of its ruling class." For example, when Rome was in the process of falling, polytheistic religions were abandoned in favor of Christianity, signifying a social turn and the end of the empire. As feudalism came toward its end, the Christian worldview gave way to "rationalist ideas" of the Enlightenment, including conceptions of liberty and freedom that have come to dominate the bourgeois era. Marx believes "the Communist revolution is the most radical rupture with traditional property relations; no wonder that its development involves the most radical rupture with traditional ideas."

Ending the section, Marx explains the communists' positive program. First, the proletariat must gain political ascendancy and control of the state, seizing capital from the bourgeoisie and centralizing all production. Then the proletariat must "increase the total of productive forces as rapidly as possible." The goal is to make the proletariat the ruling class in much the same way the bourgeoisie are today. Such radical change necessitates imposing "despotism" against private property and capital. Further, the communists will take immediate measures, including the abolition of real estate and the diversion of rents to the public, the implementation of a heavy progressive tax system, the end of inheritance, the confiscation of property from those who flee or rebel, the centralization of credit in a national bank with an exclusive monopoly over capital, the centralization of transportation and communication, an increase in factory and agricultural production, the creation of labor requirements and industrial armies (especially for agriculture), the elimination of distinctions between "urban" and "rural" in favor of a more uniform geographic population distribution, the abolition of child labor, and the implementation of free public education for children. With these structures in place, classes and class antagonism will end.

## Analysis

In [Section 2](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Communist-Manifesto/section-2-summary/) [Karl Marx](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Communist-Manifesto/author/) presents a picture of the theoretical program of the Communist League, whose aims include nationalizing capital in the state and ending class antagonism by eliminating classes and abolishing private property. He also tries to counter arguments against communism, particularly by showing that the objections to communism have parallels in capitalism, with communism simply exposing these hypocrisies.

Marx further clarifies his ideas about the relationship between social base and superstructure. He paints a picture of the party as the "advanced" layer of working-class struggle (perhaps revealing some elitist attitudes) and elaborates more on the state's role in a society in which the communists have come to power. Marx is unclear whether the assumption of power was through electoral or revolutionary means.

After dispelling some erroneous notions about communism, Marx explores the relationship of ideas to the class character of society by asking why so many objections are brought against communism from bourgeois society. Here, he finds that the "ruling ideas" of any given society are the ideas of the ruling class; in this case, the bourgeoisie. This is his clearest explanation of the base–superstructure relationship. Marx is arguing for a relationship between economics and ideology. In this conception, it would seem the economic base _causes_ the formation of particular ideas at the top of society—in particular, ideas useful for the ruling order. Marx attempts to demonstrate that his opponents' positions have merely adopted these ideas, and he seems to treat them as inconsequential to the rise of the communists.

Another important notion here is Marx's conception of the role of the party. Marx seems to believe there are objective, unitary class interests, the Communist Party being the one that understands and internalizes these notions. His statements early in the section that the communists are not sectarian and represent only the true interests of the working class speak to this belief. But he clearly sees the party as separate from the workers, an advanced layer leading the working class through the stages of class struggle to the proletarian revolution. This advanced status, he claims, is based on the party's particular insights—their "theoretical advantage" over the "mass of the proletariat." What is important here is that Marx clearly attempts to side with workers and identify with the lowest level of society in the interest of collective liberation, but he also seems to harbor elitist attitudes about the nature of that struggle and leadership in relation to class.

Finally, Marx lays out a tentative notion of what a communist society would look like, and it clearly involves a large role for the state. A number of functions would be centralized in the state to undo the capitalist order; these include a monopoly on capital, centralized communication and transportation, and service in a "labor army," particularly for agriculture. This vision has long been a point of contention among communists, with many from the left and the right (including anti-state communists) criticizing Marx for using the state to create a communist order. Nonetheless, Marx was fervent on this point, leading to later antagonisms and splits within the workers' movement.

## Summary

[Karl Marx](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Communist-Manifesto/author/) evaluates the positions of other socialist traditions, taking them to task for failing to live up to the ideas presented in _The Communist Manifesto_. He identifies three strands of faulty socialism: reactionary socialism, "conservative or bourgeois" socialism, and "critical-utopian" socialism. Against these, Marx posits the ideas of the Communist League as the real socialism, what he calls "scientific socialism."

Reactionary socialism comprises three types: feudal socialism, petty-bourgeois socialism, and "true" German socialism. Feudal socialism arose from the attempts of the aristocracy to save their class interests by aligning with the proletariat against the bourgeoisie in the era of revolution and immediately after. This tradition has never convincingly supported anything like socialism, and is often argued against even modest reforms to benefit workers. Closely allied is Christian socialism, which also cannot be real socialism, despite some of its teachings and communal leanings.

The second reactionary type, "petty-bourgeois socialism," resembles feudal socialism in that it is an attempt for one class, the petty bourgeoisie, to protect its interests. Marx argues the petty bourgeoisie are a type of "intermediate class": in some instances the burgesses held over from feudal society, or peasants or other classes not yet forced into either bourgeoisie or the proletariat. Ruined by industrial capitalism (particularly competition), they typically look to restore old methods of production to protect their interests. In places such as France with a large peasantry, socialists of this type use peasant struggles to buttress their status.

The third reactionary type, the German or "true" socialism, was developed mostly by philosophers seeking to reconcile their ideas with French Enlightenment radicalism. They failed for the most part, "emasculating" French radicalism and missing their chance when revolutionary opportunity came to Germany.

The second strand of socialism Marx takes to task is "conservative or bourgeois" socialism, which has two varieties. The first is a kind of philanthropic humanitarianism that seeks to improve the conditions of the working class and lessen the potential for revolutionary struggle. The second is a challenge to working class revolutionary activity by arguing that socialism, together with reform, is possible only by changing the structural, material basis of society.

The third strand of Marx's faulty socialism is "critical-utopian" socialism. Emerging too early to see the full development of the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, this type of socialism makes crucial mistakes, calling for an end to capitalism through peaceful rather than revolutionary means. This tradition does have valuable critiques of capitalism, wages, the family, the urban–rural divide, and other important topics, but because its proponents envision a harmony of class interests, they distance themselves from the class struggle and construct experimental settlements. While critical of capitalism, they are nonetheless "of a purely Utopian character."

## Analysis

[Section 3](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Communist-Manifesto/section-3-summary/), as well as [Section 4](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Communist-Manifesto/section-4-summary/), is short, and it is likely [Karl Marx](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Communist-Manifesto/author/) was rushed for time to complete them as he raced to finish _The Communist Manifesto_ on the crest of the revolutions of 1848. The main topic of Section 3 is the critique of other varieties of socialism, all of which Marx finds deficient. These sections may be of less theoretical interest, for they essentially offer polemics against Marx's contemporary political opponents. But they do have practical value, and many Marxists use this section and the information provided in Section 4 to debate Marx's notions of the proper forms of class struggle and the relation of communist movements to the state and to other forms of social resistance.

Most significant is Marx's critique of "critical-utopian" socialism, often referred to as "utopian socialism." Unlike utopian socialism, based on ideals, Marx's socialism is "scientific," meaning it is based on the study of capitalist society and what Marx considers the immutable forces of society—class and economics—that set definitive laws of history and social organization in class-based societies. The utopian socialists, Marx argues, have no such understanding of society; the laws of class struggle, pitting one class against another in permanent antagonism, are nowhere reflected in the utopians' ideas. For them, the unpleasant aspects of capitalism could be undone through mutual agreement, through the recognition of shared interest in the productive value of labor. Thus, many took to building voluntary rural communes organized around collective labor, thinking to bring about the socialist order in this way. Marx has nothing but ridicule and invective for these notions. Even though their critical stance against capitalism is similar to his own, Marx finds their path to socialism hopelessly naive.

Marx's "scientific" notion of socialism is important in other ways. In [Section 2](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Communist-Manifesto/section-2-summary/) Marx says the communists represent only the clearest expression of the interests of the working class; consequently, no separation of communist interests and working-class interests exists. At the same time, Marx argues that the communists represent an "advanced" layer that can instruct workers in the path toward revolution and socialism. Many of these ideas are based on Marx's understanding of these insights as being "scientific" discoveries. If class struggle were the law of history and the proletarian revolution as predictable as the path of planets across the sky, then there is but one working-class interest to be discovered and hastened. But factors such as race, gender, or even variations in one's relationship to the means of production can produce varied or multiple working-class interests, which a single party might have trouble representing or acting on.

Another important idea is Marx's notion of class society as far more complicated than a basic two-class structure. Most of the "reactionary" versions of socialism Marx condemns are, for him, based on the class positions of "intermediate" classes, neither bourgeois nor proletariat, which continue to operate in a capitalist society. Notable examples here include elements of the feudal aristocracy who seek to quash bourgeois revolutionaries by allying with other classes or the "petty-bourgeois" class. The latter serves as a catchall for various groups of people displaced by capitalism who don't quite fit into either of the two major classes. These groups include master artisans; shopkeepers; free-propertied peasants; and others who don't work in, manage, or own factories. The members of the petty-bourgeois have no rooted class position themselves but move between the major classes as they maneuver for political and economic advantage; sometimes employing the language of socialism, sometimes not. Left unsaid, however, is what will happen to them in the proletarian revolution.

# Section 4 : Position of the Communists in Relation to the Various Existing Opposition Parties | Summary

## Summary

In this section [Karl Marx](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Communist-Manifesto/author/) gives an account of communist activity in several European countries, claiming that the communists attempt to push forward the movements for "immediate aims" but are also mindful of the "future of the movement." In France, the communists therefore ally with the Social Democrats, while maintaining the ability to criticize the traditions "handed down from the great Revolution." In Switzerland, they support the Radical Party, while recognizing that the party is divided to some extent by class antagonisms. In Poland, the communists insist first on the primacy of the agrarian revolution as a step toward national emancipation. Germany, however, is the most important site of communist activity because Germany has the most "advanced conditions," a "developed proletariat," and is on the brink of a bourgeois revolution, soon to be followed by the proletarian revolution. In Germany, the communists ally with the bourgeoisie when such an alliance may further the revolution, but they also "instill into the working class the clearest possible recognition of the ... antagonism between bourgeoisie and proletariat."

The communists support revolutionary struggle of all kinds as attacks on the established order, and simultaneously they heighten the "property question" in those struggles, trying to bring about "the union and agreement of the democratic parties of all countries." In short, the communists advocate the "overthrow of all existing social conditions" because they believe "the proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains." They call for working people of every nation to unite.

## Analysis

[Section 4](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Communist-Manifesto/section-4-summary/) focuses on the practical activity of communist revolutionaries in advance of a revolution. For this, [Karl Marx](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Communist-Manifesto/author/) sees communists taking a variety of tactical and strategic positions in each country, depending on conditions and party formations. Perhaps most interestingly, he sees communists allying with any other revolutionary party—even bourgeois revolutionary parties—if it will help advance the "stage" of the class struggle. Germany is a particularly interesting example, where he argues that a bourgeois revolution will have to occur first against the Prussian autarchy, and he advocates that communists assist in hastening this revolution before launching a proletarian revolution.

This formulation is curious, for it seems to imply that egalitarian, class-based revolutions are not possible until nations have undergone the proper "stages" of the Hegelian dialectic. Therefore, if "bourgeois society" has not yet been established, then revolutionaries of the proletariat must first work to bring about the bourgeois rise to power, and from there embark upon their own agenda to overthrow the existing bourgeois state. The intermediate step should not be ignored. This concept, and Marx's position on it, would be of great importance in subsequent revolutions, particularly that of the Paris Commune in 1871 and the Russian Revolution in 1917. In the 1840s, however, Marx seemed to consider staged revolutions as the only way forward.

As a corollary, Marx's notions of social struggle are oriented toward party-system democracy and parliamentary politics. For all the discussion of revolution, the immediate activity of Communist Party members, as indicated by his discussion of various countries, is to involve themselves in the bourgeois party process and elections. Many have questioned this stance and Marx's vision of the practical activity of a revolutionary party. This section is far too short to provide clarity, and Marx has few writings elsewhere on the topic. Following the Paris Commune revolution in 1871, Marx did modify these views somewhat, but on practical questions, he continued to provide few answers.

1.

> A specter is haunting Europe—the specter of Communism. 

Narrator, [Introduction](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Communist-Manifesto/introduction-summary/)

Karl Marx opens the work with these now-famous words. He is saying in mid-19th-century European politics, _Communism_ has become a watchword, an insult bandied about to disparage political opponents. But like much in politics, the accusations are mostly false; there are few known communists in the parliamentary systems. Nonetheless, for bourgeois politics as usual, Marx is saying communism is already feared as being dangerous because of its mission to do away with capitalism and the bourgeois state.

2.

> The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles. 

Narrator, [Section 1](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Communist-Manifesto/section-1-summary/)

Karl Marx claims that the "motor force" of history is the struggle between classes. Over time, classes change—from slaves to serfs to peasants—in conflict with masters, lords or aristocrats; however, it is the same and continuing class conflict that defines the politics of a period and marks the shifts in epochs as class relations change. For Marx, class conflict is defined by the bourgeoisie and the proletariat in permanent conflict over wages and profits.

3.

> The executive of the modern State is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie. 

Narrator, [Section 1](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Communist-Manifesto/section-1-summary/)

Trying to show the relationship between class power and political power, Karl Marx says the result of the political revolutions of the Enlightenment was to overthrow the feudal order and put into power the new class that chafed against monarchies. Thus, modern democracies are implements of class rule and act more as "dictatorships" of class interests than as popular democracies.

4.

> Constant revolutionizing of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones. 

Narrator, [Section 1](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Communist-Manifesto/section-1-summary/)

Karl Marx is trying to show the relationship between the transformation in industrial production and social ideas and social formations. First, the industrial revolution unleashed a wave of change in technology and production unparalleled in history. Those changes in production, in turn, produced changes in ideas and social formations; for example, doing away with notions of paternalism (a system where authority meets the needs and monitors the conduct of individuals) or obligation in exchange for the indifferent market, whereby sentimentality gives way to calculation. The key ideas are that economic changes of production relate to social changes of ideas, and these changes come rapidly with industrialization.

5.

> The weapons with which the bourgeoisie felled feudalism ... are now turned against ... itself ... [and] called into existence the men who are to wield those weapons—the ... proletarians. 

Narrator, [Section 1](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Communist-Manifesto/section-1-summary/)

This quotation shows Karl Marx's staged vision of history as well as the basis of his ideas of class struggle. The weapons to which Marx refers are the means of production. With the rise of industrialism and the decline of feudalism, the bourgeoisie are the class born from manufacturing and later industrial manufacturing. Eventually the productive forces and the new class burst through old ideas, politics, and feudal systems to give rise to the modern era. Marx believes the same productive forces that support the bourgeoisie would eventually trap them by failures of overproduction and the shackles of private property. A new order would thus arise, helped by the proletarian revolution, to herald the era of communism.

6.

> Of all the classes that stand face to face with the bourgeoisie today, the proletariat alone is a really revolutionary class. 

Narrator, [Section 1](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Communist-Manifesto/section-1-summary/)

Karl Marx was the first writer to point to the proletariat as the agent of revolutionary struggle. This quotation reveals his thought that the proletariat plays a special historic role, one that will ultimately usher in a new era of political history.

7.

> What the bourgeoisie, therefore, produces, above all, is its own grave-diggers. Its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable. 

Narrator, [Section 1](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Communist-Manifesto/section-1-summary/)

This quotation again highlights Karl Marx's view of political history as stages of progression. Marx is predicting the future based on recent forms of social struggle and change that developed in Europe. Where the bourgeois were born in feudalism, it became the seed that undid the feudal order and sought a revolution in politics and social organization. A similar revolution will happen to the bourgeois order, the seed being the proletariat. According to his analysis of history, Marx was confident enough to call this eventual downfall "inevitable."

8.

> In bourgeois society, living labor is but a means to increase accumulated labor. In Communist society, accumulated labor is but a means to widen, to enrich, to promote the existence of the laborer. 

Narrator, [Section 2](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Communist-Manifesto/section-2-summary/)

In a capitalist economy, people work to increase wealth but see little return for their efforts. This is the bourgeois social order in which workers, or "living labor," exist to serve capital, or "accumulated labor."

9.

> In bourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality, while the living person is dependent and has no individuality. 

Narrator, [Section 2](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Communist-Manifesto/section-2-summary/)

Karl Marx sees political history as a class struggle based on wealth. Opposed to materialism and the accumulation of wealth and the power it grants, Marx's communist society has capital serving the interests of living people—workers—to provide "independence and individuality," rather than strip them from the workers as it now does under capitalism. Thus, capital would serve workers, not owners, directly.

10.

> Working men have no country. 

Narrator, [Section 2](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Communist-Manifesto/section-2-summary/)

Karl Marx says workers are not part of their political nations because they are excluded and exploited by the bourgeoisie that control the state, or the means of power. Further, antagonism between nations is a reflection of class antagonism at home. When class struggle ceases, national struggle will end as well, and nations will recognize a natural harmony of interest.

11.

> The ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of its ruling class. 

Narrator, [Section 2](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Communist-Manifesto/section-2-summary/)

Karl Marx is arguing that ideas, culture, and ideology in society reflect material interests—of class and economics. This notion is at the foundation of two of Marx's principles. The first principle is the idea of historical materialism: material forces drive historical change; the second is the "base/superstructure" idea that the economic base determines much of what happens in the political superstructure.

12.

> The Communist revolution is the most radical rupture with traditional property relations; no wonder that its development involves the most radical rupture with traditional ideas. 

Narrator, [Section 2](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Communist-Manifesto/section-2-summary/)

Karl Marx is again arguing that economics determines ideas. Because the communists want to undo property relations and create an egalitarian society, they also have radical political ideas, not related merely to property but also to other social relations as well. These ideas, if put into action, could change the way people work and live, causing huge upheavals on all levels of society.

13.

> Political power, properly so called, is merely the organized power of one class for oppressing the other. 

Narrator, [Section 2](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Communist-Manifesto/section-2-summary/)

This is a core idea in Karl Marx's concept of the state, conceived of as a neutral implement used in the interest of one class or the other. In bourgeois society, politics are the domain of the rich—the ruling class—and the state is a tool to express their interests. A proletarian revolution would reverse that order, making the state serve working-class interests and thus undoing the class divide in society.

14.

> As the parson has ever gone hand in hand with the landlord, so has Clerical Socialism with Feudal Socialism. 

Narrator, [Section 3](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Communist-Manifesto/section-3-summary/)

This excerpt comes from Karl Marx's critique of other forms of socialism. For Marx, both feudal socialism and Christian socialism are "reactionary." They are ideas of social harmony espoused by other classes (particularly feudal aristocrats or Christian clerics) to protect their interests in the era of bourgeois revolutions. This mirrors a shared perspective of these groups under feudalism, in which their ideas about the world are entirely false.

15.

> Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution ... Proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win. WORKING MEN OF ALL COUNTRIES, UNITE! 

Narrator, [Section 4](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Communist-Manifesto/section-4-summary/)

_The Communist Manifesto_ announced the emergence, above ground, of revolutionary communist groups previously forced underground by state repression. Karl Marx says they no longer must hide their views and can openly avow the "forcible overthrow" of all of bourgeois society, thus causing the rich to be afraid. In one of his most famous slogans, Marx urges the proletariat to unite and fight for the revolution, as workers have "nothing to lose but their chains."

#  Biography

### Karl Marx

##### University Years and Early Radicalism

Karl Marx was a German philosopher, writer, revolutionary, and active participant in early communist and working-class movements. Marx was born on May 5, 1818, to middle-class parents in Trier (in what is now Germany), and received a private education before going to public high school. From there he attended the University of Bonn, where he studied humanities. He developed a personal interest in the works of the German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. He left after a year and began studying law and philosophy at the University of Berlin. In 1836 he became engaged to Jenny von Westphalen, whom he had known since childhood, a baroness who abandoned her aristocratic background to be with Marx.

The two married after a seven-year engagement and remained together until Jenny's death in 1881. While at university Marx was attracted to various radical circles, including the Poets' Club in Bonn and the Young Hegelians in Berlin, a group that embraced the radical and revolutionary aspects of Hegelian philosophy. Because of its radicalism, Marx's dissertation likely would not have been accepted at the University of Berlin, so Marx submitted it to the more permissive University of Jena, which granted him a PhD in 1841. With the generally conservative atmosphere in Prussian Germany, Marx could not find an academic position and so took up journalism after graduating, writing for the radical press and cultivating his ideas on economics and socialism, the theory that advocates government ownership of goods production and distribution.

##### Journalism and Exile

Marx's writings got him into trouble, leading to a period of exile that lasted until his death. After publishing an article critical of Russian Tsarism (autocracy) in 1890, Marx was banned by the Prussian state (Germany was not yet unified). As Marx was adopting and developing the ideas he would put into _The_ _Communist Manifesto_, his writing got him exiled from Paris. He moved to Brussels, where he wrote _The Communist Manifesto_ for the Communist League. The document contains many ideas from the broader socialist movements—socialism, another left-wing school of thought that has commonalities with communism, also includes social reforms such as universal health care for the welfare of the people. _The Communist Manifesto_ also included Marx's own insights, written for popular consumption, in their most condensed and approachable form.

After living in Paris and Brussels for brief periods, Marx settled eventually in London, which became his lifelong home. In these capital cities, Marx associated with a growing movement of revolutionary activists and thinkers, including people connected with the "League of the Just." This group later became the Communist League, which commissioned Marx to draw up a set principles, the _Communist Manifesto_. In this milieu, he met German philosopher Friedrich Engels. A lifelong friend and collaborator, Engels helped support Marx and his family.

Following the 1848 publication by _The Communist Manifesto_'s original name, _Manifesto of the Communist Party_, Marx was buffeted by the tides then overtaking revolutionary Europe. In 1848 a series of revolutions in France, some German states, Austria, Italy, Denmark, and elsewhere convulsed continental Europe, in several instances leading to the construction of constitutional democracies. Influenced by these forces, Marx attempted to establish revolutionary newspapers. For his efforts he faced police harassment and prosecution, forcing him, to flee from Brussels by 1849. At the time Marx arrived in London in 1850, there was an international hub of exiled revolutionaries from across Europe, and Marx involved himself in greater political activism and more serious study.  

##### Marx and Revolution

Marx's participation in the Communist League led to internal strife regarding tactics and strategy. Some group members wanted to precipitate a workers' revolution through an action that would inspire people to revolt. Opposed to this action, Marx called it "adventurism" and forced a split in the group. Years later in the 1870s, this pattern would repeat itself in the International Workingmen's Association, a London-based federation of European worker organizations advancing socialism and communism. Also known as the First International, the organization had many internal differences of opinion, the biggest being the disagreement over the role of the state. Anti-state socialists converged around the figure of Russian revolutionary and anarchist Mikhail Bakunin, arguing that Marx's vision of a state-run workers' society was foolish. More than a theoretical difference, this was a matter of practical import about whether to participate in bourgeois elections and worker political parties as a pathway toward revolution. Marx forced a split in the organization, ousting the anti-statist members and moving its headquarters to New York, thereby contributing to the downfall of the group.

From 1850 to 1870 Marx wrote some of his most noteworthy works other than _The Communist_ _Manifesto_, including his history of the 1848 revolution in France, _The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte_, and his 1867 masterwork, _Capital_, which offers a far-ranging critique of capitalism and solidified Marx's position as a major philosopher of the 19th century. In 1871 revolutions again broke out in Europe, and in France where the Paris Commune (radical revolutionary government that ruled Paris from March to May of 1871, following French military leader Napoleon's defeat) and the struggle of the Communards excited the hopes of revolutionaries worldwide. For Marx, as developed in his long pamphlet on the revolution, _The Civil War in France_ (1871), the Paris Commune seemed to point a new way forward toward a potentially stateless version of worker democracy and class power. In the final decade of his life, Marx worked on two subsequent volumes to _Capital_: _Capital__,_ _Volume II_ (1885) and _Capital,_ _Volume III_ (1894)_,_ which developed the insights framed in the first volume and sought to give his philosophical ideas greater rigor.

##### Death and Legacy

In 1881 Marx's wife, Jenny, died of liver cancer. Soon after her death, Marx took ill, suffering from inflammation of the lungs and chest before succumbing to bronchitis on March 14, 1883. He and Jenny are buried in London's Highgate Cemetery. The legacy of Marx's views and writings cannot be overstated, for they radically moved the course of 19th- and 20th-century history.

### Friedrich Engels

##### Early Education and Influences

Friedrich Engels was born on November 28, 1820, in Barmen, Prussia (now part of Germany) where his father owned a textile factory. The product of a devout Protestant family, he attended secondary school before becoming a business apprentice under his father's guidance. He was interested in revolutionary writings from an early age and was particularly influenced by the writings of German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831). Hegel attempted to unite theories of philosophy, science, politics, and religion into a single discipline he called the "absolute idea." In 1842, after a year of military service, Engels joined a group of fellow Hegel followers called the Young Hegelians, who convinced him to become an atheist.

##### Conversion to Communism

Engels was converted to communism by Moses Hess (1812–75), whom he met in 1842. Hess was a German journalist for the liberal publication _Rheinische Zeitung_ (_Rhinelander Gazette_). It is after this meeting that socialist and communist ideas first appear in Engels's writing. According to political theory professor Terrell Carver, an expert on Marx and Engels, there was no distinction between the two ideologies at that time.

Engels arrived in London in November 1842 on his way to Manchester, where his father owned a cotton plant. While working at the plant from 1842 to 1844 he contributed articles about communism and political conditions in England to a Paris-based journal edited by Karl Marx. The two became friends and writing collaborators on various essays. After returning to Barmen in 1845, Engels published _The Condition of the Working Class in England_.

##### _The Communist Manifesto_

In 1847 Engels was commissioned by the Communist League along with Karl Marx to write _The_ _Communist Manifesto_. While Marx drew on Engels's ideas, the latter writer's role was more limited.

Engels wrote of his contributions:

>  I had a certain independent share in laying the foundations of the theory, and more particularly in its elaboration. But the greater part of its leading basic principles, especially in the realm of economics and history, and, above all, their final trenchant formulation, belong to Marx. ... Without him the theory would not be by far what it is today. It therefore rightly bears his name. 

Engels continued writing, and he also took part in the German revolutions of 1848–49, which were protests against the government of the independent states that made up the German Confederation. He returned to work at his father's firm in Manchester in 1850 and provided financial support to Karl Marx for the writing of _Capital_ before retiring from business in 1869. He told Marx in a letter, "I have finished with sweet commerce today and I am a free man."

##### Later Work

As _The Communist Manifesto_ (_Manifesto of the Communist Party_) became more widely known, Engels and Marx revised it, publishing a new edition in 1872. This edition was the first to bear the shortened title, _The Communist Manifesto_. After the death of Marx in 1883, Engels used his friend's notes to publish the second and third volumes of _Capital_. He died of cancer on August 5, 1895, having contributed to one of the most influential political texts ever written.

# 10 Things You Didn't Know

No intellectual figure is as inseparable from the worldwide socialist and communist movements of the 19th and 20th centuries as German philosopher Karl Marx. Along with German philosopher Friedrich Engels, Marx authored _The Communist Manifesto_ to provide a framework for communist thought and to detail a blueprint for proletariat revolutions throughout Europe. First published in 1848, _The Communist Manifesto_ presented Europe's tumultuous and violent history through the lens of class struggles, insinuating that aristocracy and the persistent oppression of the lower classes was to blame for many of the continent's greatest problems.

Upon the _Manifesto_'s publication and circulation, Marx and Engels found themselves declared enemies of Europe's most powerful regimes. The document was considered both treasonous and enlightened, both a rallying cry and a subversive discourse. Scholars continue to be fascinated by some of Marx's accurate predictions regarding the evolving global economy, as well as the number of revolutions and rebellions that owed their start to the ideas outlined in _The Communist Manifesto_.

## 1. Marx was criticized for his lengthy procrastination while writing _The Communist Manifesto_.

The composition of _The Communist Manifesto_ wasn't exactly a [speedy process](https://books.google.com/books?id=3KOyuSakn80C&lpg=PA118&dq=marx%20%22ceaseless%20procrastination%22&pg=PA118#v=onepage&q&f=false). In fact Marx procrastinated so heavily on the project that he drew the ire of many of his allies. When Marx and Engels were first commissioned to write a draft of _The Communist Manifesto_ by the Communist League—an international organization of communist intellectuals and radicals—Marx traveled around Europe for the next year, delivering lectures, writing articles for periodicals, and seeking further distractions. _The Communist Manifesto_ wasn't the only work that Marx procrastinated so heavily on, either—he took [two decades](https://books.google.com/books?id=lmOaAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA80&dq=marx%20communist%20manifesto%20procrastination&pg=PA80#v=onepage&q&f=false) to compose his book-long treatise, _Capital_, which he worked on from 1846 until its publication in 1867.

## 2. _The Communist Manifesto_ got Marx kicked out of several countries in Europe.

Marx's promotion of communist principles was not well received by many of the established aristocratic governments of Europe during the 19th century. Before the publication of _The Communist Manifesto_, Marx had been expelled from Prussia (part of modern-day Germany) and France, and he had renounced his Prussian citizenship. After the work's publication in 1848, he was [promptly expelled](http://www.history.com/topics/karl-marx) from Belgium, where he'd been temporarily residing. Marx finally fled to England where he found sanctuary for the rest of his life, but he was never granted British citizenship. Since he'd already given up his original citizenship, Marx technically died stateless.

## 3. Marx was inspired by the works of English playwright William Shakespeare—particularly _Hamlet_.

One of Marx's greatest inspirations wasn't a work of political theory or philosophy—but rather one of Renaissance drama. Marx loved the works of [William Shakespeare](http://www.counterfire.org/articles/analysis/18300-marx-s-shakespeare), particularly _Hamlet_, as he respected the characters' questioning of those in power. In _Hamlet_, although the titular protagonist is noble by birth, he stands up to his nation's regime to uncover a complex conspiracy. Marx also appreciated Shakespeare's use of psychologically complex characters as he felt the playwright presented lower-class figures as witty and intellectually engaged as opposed to mere tools to be used by the nobility.

## 4. _The Communist Manifesto_ fell into obscurity for years after its publication.

Despite all the work that Marx and Engels put into crafting _The Communist Manifesto_, the work's impact on Europe wasn't visible for decades after its publication. Although it created a stir when first published, _The Communist Manifesto_ was [largely ignored](https://books.google.com/books?id=0QIH2dOXuOcC&lpg=PT81&dq=%22By%20the%20middle%201860s%20virtually%20nothing%20that%20Marx%20had%20written%20in%20the%20past%20was%20any%20longer%20in%20print.%22&pg=PT81#v=onepage&q&f=false) and forgotten. When various revolutions sprang up in Europe in 1848—and failed miserably—communist ideology quickly lost its appeal as order was reestablished. There were only two translations of _The Communist Manifesto_ produced between 1848 and 1868, and by the mid-1860s Marx's works were nearly all out of print. _The Communist Manifesto_ had a revival in the form of a new 1872 edition, however, which became the staple for the communist movements of the late 19th century.

## 5. _The Communist Manifesto_ was originally published anonymously—until a translator spilled the beans.

_The Communist Manifesto_ was written to be a subversive and controversial work, so Marx and Engels wanted to keep their role in crafting it [secret](https://books.google.com/books?id=D4UyDAAAQBAJ&lpg=PT57&dq=communist%20manifesto%20anonymous&pg=PT57#v=onepage&q&f=false). When an [English translation](https://books.google.com/books?id=CjMhtCAWokYC&lpg=PA91&dq=communist%20manifesto%20authorship%20revealed&pg=PA91#v=onepage&q&f=false) was serialized in 1850, the editor and translator George Julian Harney included an introductory note that the original was written by the two communist intellectuals. This was the first time Marx and Engels had been acknowledged for the work publicly. The authors would eventually reveal themselves in 1872 in their prefaces to the new edition, but only because they had been outed beforehand.

## 6. Engels confessed that _The Communist Manifesto_ was really Marx's work, not his own.

Although _The Communist Manifesto_ is attributed to both Marx and Engels as coauthors, [Engels admitted](https://books.google.com/books?id=qhdxAwAAQBAJ&lpg=PA390&dq=%22The%20basic%20thought%20running%20through%20the%20Manifesto%20...%20belongs%20solely%20and%20exclusively%20to%20Marx.%22&pg=PA390#v=onepage&q&f=false) that Marx was the true force behind the publication. Engels was involved with the document's composition, and he was frequently consulted by Marx. However, Engels wrote in his preface to the 1883 edition, "The basic thought running through the _Manifesto_ ... belongs solely and exclusively to Marx." He elaborated on this claim in the subsequent 1888 translation, stating:

>  The _Manifesto_ being our joint production, I consider myself bound to state that the fundamental proposition, which forms its nucleus, belongs to Marx. 

## 7. _The Communist Manifesto_ helped spark riots and revolutions in Germany in 1848.

_The Communist Manifesto_ is often falsely credited for [encouraging revolutions](https://www.marxist.com/1848-revolutions.htm) throughout Western Europe, including France, in 1848—however, many of these revolts predated the _Manifesto_'s publication by several months. Scholars often attribute the 1848 uprising in Germany to the _Manifesto_'s influence, however, and Marx and Engels closely monitored the revolution's brief successes. When riots broke out in Vienna and Berlin in March, Engels hoped that power would reside:

>  Not [with] the cowardly German burghers but the German workers; they will rise up, put an end to the whole filthy, muddled official German rule and with a radical revolution restore the honor of Germany ... Germany will liberate herself to the extent to which she sets free neighboring nations. 

Although this revolution led to some democratic rights, control ultimately returned to the bourgeois, just as Marx and Engels had feared.

## 8. Marx is often credited for predicting 21st-century economic inequality.

One of the key reasons Marxism is still relevant is Marx's prediction regarding contemporary [global economic inequality](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/10/karl-marx-yesterday-and-today). Marx viewed the rapid industrialization of Europe as a preface to a globalized economy. He also saw the negative effect that this development was having: instead of improving the lives of everyone, industrialization was creating a larger divide between wealthy and poor. The process was causing the rich to get richer and the poor to slave away for stagnating factory wages. Marx predicted this economic trend would spark revolutions—which it certainly did throughout the 20th century—but that without revolutionary success, the wealth gap would continue to persist and grow.

## 9. A treason trial allowed _The Communist Manifesto_ to be republished in Germany.

_The Communist Manifesto_ saw a rise in popularity in 1872, more than two decades after its initial publication. The work was inadvertently "legalized" again, as it was read during the [treason trial](https://books.google.com/books?id=gsmdKT_TV8cC&lpg=PA6&dq=1872%20germany%20communist%20manifesto%20trial&pg=PA6#v=onepage&q&f=false) of German Social-Democratic leaders who had voiced opposition to war with France. The prosecution needed to secure copies to read at the trial, giving the Social-Democrats a chance to print the document. Against the intentions of the prosecution, the trial also provided a great deal of publicity for _The Communist Manifesto_, and demand for the work exploded in 1872. Over the next few years the document was translated and circulated in Europe far more widely than at the time of its original publication.

## 10. Engels left Marx's daughters—both of whom committed suicide—a large inheritance.

Engels's close friendship with Marx was apparent in his will, in which he left a sizable chunk of his [life savings](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/25/books/review/love-and-capital-by-mary-gabriel-book-review.html) to Marx's daughters. Despite his alignment with the proletariat, Engels was extremely wealthy at the time of his death, with an estate worth $4.8 million. Tragically, both of Marx's daughters later committed suicide. His daughter, Tussy, killed herself in 1897, while his daughter, Laura, committed suicide in a death pact with her husband in 1911.
