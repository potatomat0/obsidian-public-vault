Dialectics in Marxism is a method of understanding the world that emphasizes the role of conflict and change. It is based on the idea that everything in the world is constantly changing, and that these changes are driven by the conflict between opposing forces.

Marx and Engels developed their theory of dialectics in opposition to Hegelian dialectics, which they believed was too abstract and idealistic. They argued that dialectics should be based on the material world, and that it should be used to understand the real-world processes of conflict and change.

The Marxist dialectic is a three-part process that involves:

1. **Thesis:** The thesis is an initial state of affairs, or a set of ideas.
2. **Antithesis:** The antithesis is the opposite of the thesis, or a set of ideas that challenges the thesis.
3. **Synthesis:** The synthesis is the resolution of the thesis and antithesis, or a new set of ideas that incorporates elements of both the thesis and antithesis.

The Marxist dialectic is often used to explain social change. For example, Marx argued that the capitalist system is a thesis that is inevitably challenged by the antithesis of the working class. The conflict between these two forces will eventually lead to a synthesis, or a new social system, such as socialism or communism.

The Marxist dialectic is a complex and nuanced theory, and there is still much debate about its merits. However, it remains an important and influential theory in the social sciences and political thought.

Here are some of the key tenets of dialectics in Marxism:

- The world is constantly changing.
- Change is driven by conflict between opposing forces.
- The synthesis of opposing forces is a new and higher state of development.
- The dialectical process is a never-ending cycle.

## Examples 

- The rise of capitalism can be seen as a dialectical process. The thesis was the feudal system, which was based on serfdom and agriculture. The antithesis was the bourgeoisie, a new class of merchants and traders who emerged in the late Middle Ages. The conflict between these two forces led to the synthesis of capitalism, a new economic system based on private property and wage labor.
- The Russian Revolution can also be seen as a dialectical process. The thesis was the Tsarist autocracy, which was based on absolute rule and serfdom. The antithesis was the Russian proletariat, a new class of industrial workers who emerged in the late 19th century. The conflict between these two forces led to the synthesis of the Soviet Union, a new political system based on communism.
- The development of the internet can also be seen as a dialectical process. The thesis was the telegraph, which was a new technology that allowed for the rapid transmission of information. The antithesis was the telephone, which allowed for two-way communication. The synthesis of these two technologies led to the internet, which is a global network of computers that allows for the rapid and easy transmission of information.
