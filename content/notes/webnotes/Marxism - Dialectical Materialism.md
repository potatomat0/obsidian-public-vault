## Definition 

Materialism in Marxism is the belief that the material world, or the world of physical objects and processes, is the primary reality. This means that ideas, consciousness, and other immaterial phenomena are ultimately determined by the material conditions of society.

Marx and Engels developed their theory of materialism in opposition to idealism, which holds that the immaterial world, or the world of ideas and thoughts, is the primary reality. Idealists argue that the material world is ultimately a product of our minds, while materialists argue that the material world is the foundation of all reality, including our thoughts and ideas.

Marx's theory of historical materialism is based on the materialist conception of history. This theory holds that the material conditions of society, such as the mode of production and the relations of production, are the primary determinants of social change. In other words, the way that people produce and distribute goods and services in a society determines the social, political, and cultural structures of that society.

For example, Marx argued that the rise of capitalism was due to the development of new technologies and the need for a more efficient way to produce goods. The capitalist mode of production, with its emphasis on private property and the exploitation of labor, led to the development of new social classes, such as the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. These social classes eventually came into conflict, leading to the socialist revolution.

Marx's theory of materialism has been influential in many fields, including sociology, anthropology, and economics. It has also been used to justify political movements, such as communism and socialism.

Here are some of the key tenets of materialism in Marxism:

- The material world is the primary reality.
- Ideas and consciousness are ultimately determined by the material conditions of society.
- The mode of production and the relations of production are the primary determinants of social change.
- History is a dialectical process, characterized by conflict and change.
- The goal of history is the emancipation of the working class.
