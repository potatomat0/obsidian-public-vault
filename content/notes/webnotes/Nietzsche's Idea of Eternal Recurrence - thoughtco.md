_____
- **Eternal recurrence** is the philosophical concept that everything that has happened will happen again, an infinite number of times.
- Nietzsche first introduced the idea in his book _The Gay Science_, and he returned to it in later works, such as _Thus Spoke Zarathustra_.
- The idea of eternal recurrence is meant to challenge us to think about the meaning of our lives and whether we are living them in a way that we would be willing to repeat eternally.
- If we are not, then we need to make changes to our lives so that we can live them with greater meaning and purpose.
- Nietzsche believed that the idea of eternal recurrence could be a powerful tool for self-transformation. If we can face the prospect of living our lives eternally and still be able to say that we have lived them well, then we have achieved a great deal.
