 The **dew point** is the [temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature "Temperature") to which [air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air "Air") must be cooled to become saturated with [water vapor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_vapor "Water vapor"), given a particular air pressure and water content. When air is cooled below the dew point, its [moisture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moisture "Moisture") capacity is reduced and airborne water vapor will [condense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensation "Condensation") to form liquid water known as [dew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dew "Dew").When this occurs through the air's contact with a colder surface, dew will form on that surface.

The dew point is affected by the air's [humidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity "Humidity"). The more moisture the air contains, the higher its dew point.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dew_point#cite_note-WallaceHobbs2006-3)

When the temperature is below the freezing point of water, the dew point is called the **frost point**, as [frost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frost "Frost") is formed via [deposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_(phase_transition) "Deposition (phase transition)") rather than condensation. In liquids, the analog to the dew point is the [cloud point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_point "Cloud point").

## Humidity

If all the other factors influencing humidity remain constant, at ground level the [relative humidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_humidity "Relative humidity") rises as the temperature falls; this is because less vapor is needed to saturate the air. In normal conditions, the dew point temperature will not be greater than the air temperature, since relative humidity typically does not exceed 100%.

In technical terms, the dew point is the temperature at which the water vapor in a sample of [air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air "Air") at constant [barometric pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometric_pressure "Barometric pressure") condenses into liquid water at the same [rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_rate "Reaction rate") at which it evaporates. At temperatures below the dew point, the rate of condensation will be greater than that of evaporation, forming more liquid water. The condensed water is called [dew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dew "Dew") when it forms on a solid surface, or [frost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frost "Frost") if it freezes. In the air, the condensed water is called either [fog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog "Fog") or a [cloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud "Cloud"), depending on its altitude when it forms. If the temperature is below the dew point, and no dew or fog forms, the vapor is called [supersaturated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersaturated "Supersaturated"). This can happen if there are not enough particles in the air to act as [condensation nuclei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensation_nuclei "Condensation nuclei").

The dew point depends on how much water vapor the air contains. If the air is very dry and has few water molecules, the dew point is low and surfaces must be much cooler than the air for condensation to occur. If the air is very humid and contains many water molecules, the dew point is high and condensation can occur on surfaces that are only a few degrees cooler than the air.

A high relative humidity implies that the dew point is close to the current air temperature. A relative humidity of 100% indicates the dew point is equal to the current temperature and that the air is maximally saturated with water. When the moisture content remains constant and temperature increases, relative humidity decreases, but the dew point remains constant.

[General aviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_aviation "General aviation") pilots use dew point data to calculate the likelihood of [carburetor icing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carburetor_icing "Carburetor icing") and [fog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog "Fog"), and to estimate the height of a [cumuliform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumuliform "Cumuliform") [cloud base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_base "Cloud base").

This graph shows the maximum percentage, by mass, of water vapor that air at [sea-level pressure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea-level_pressure "Sea-level pressure") across a range of temperatures can contain. For a lower ambient pressure, a curve has to be drawn above the current curve. A higher ambient pressure yields a curve under the current curve.

Increasing the barometric pressure increases the dew point.This means that, if the pressure increases, the mass of water vapor per volume unit of air must be reduced in order to maintain the same dew point. For example, consider New York City (33 ft or 10 m elevation) and Denver (5,280 ft or 1,610 m elevation. Because Denver is at a higher elevation than New York, it will tend to have a lower barometric pressure. This means that if the dew point and temperature in both cities are the same, the amount of water vapor in the air will be greater in Denver.

## Dew point weather records
- **Highest dew point temperature:** A dew point of 35 °C (95 °F) — while the temperature was 42 °C (108 °F) — was observed at [Dhahran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhahran "Dhahran"), Saudi Arabia, at 3:00 p.m. on 8 July 2003.
- **Highest temperature with 100% of relative humidity**: A temperature of 34 °C (93 °F) with 100% of relative humidity in [Jask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jask "Jask"), [Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran "Iran"), on 21 July 2012.

## Relationship to human comfort

When the air temperature is high, the human body uses the evaporation of perspiration to cool down, with the cooling effect directly related to how fast the perspiration evaporates. The rate at which perspiration can evaporate depends on how much moisture is in the air and how much moisture the air can hold. If the air is already saturated with moisture (humid), perspiration will not evaporate. The body's [thermoregulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoregulation "Thermoregulation") will produce perspiration in an effort to keep the body at its normal temperature even when the rate at which it is producing sweat exceeds the evaporation rate, so one can become coated with sweat on humid days even without generating additional body heat (such as by exercising).

As the air surrounding one's body is warmed by body heat, it will rise and be replaced with other air. If air is moved away from one's body with a natural breeze or a fan, sweat will evaporate faster, making perspiration more effective at cooling the body. As there is more unevaporated perspiration, discomfort increases.

A [wet bulb thermometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet_bulb_thermometer "Wet bulb thermometer") also uses [evaporative cooling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaporative_cooling "Evaporative cooling"), so it provides a good measure for use in evaluating comfort level.

Discomfort also exists when the dew point is very low (below around −5 °C or 23 °F).The drier air can cause skin to crack and become irritated more easily. It will also dry out the airways. The US [Occupational Safety and Health Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration "Occupational Safety and Health Administration") recommends indoor air be maintained at 20–24.5 °C (68–76 °F) with a 20–60% relative humidity, equivalent to a dew point of approximately 4.0 to 16.5 °C (39 to 62 °F) (by Simple Rule calculation below).

Lower dew points, less than 10 °C (50 °F), correlate with lower ambient temperatures and cause the body to require less cooling. A lower dew point can go along with a high temperature only at extremely low relative humidity, allowing for relatively effective cooling.

People inhabiting [tropical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_climate "Tropical climate") and [subtropical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humid_subtropical_climate "Humid subtropical climate") climates acclimatize somewhat to higher dew points. Thus, a resident of [Singapore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore "Singapore") or [Miami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami "Miami"), for example, might have a higher threshold for discomfort than a resident of a temperate climate like [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London "London") or [Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago "Chicago"). People accustomed to temperate climates often begin to feel uncomfortable when the dew point gets above 15 °C (59 °F), while others might find dew points up to 18 °C (64 °F) comfortable. Most inhabitants of temperate areas will consider dew points above 21 °C (70 °F) oppressive and tropical-like, while inhabitants of hot and humid areas may not find this uncomfortable. Thermal comfort depends not just on physical environmental factors, but also on psychological factors.
