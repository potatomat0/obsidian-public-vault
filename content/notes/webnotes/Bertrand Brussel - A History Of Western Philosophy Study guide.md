### Type

Nonfiction

### Genre

Philosophy

### At a Glance

Bertrand Russell wrote his treatise _A History of Western Philosophy_ to show that philosophy is an important part of the political and cultural lives of civilizations. He also shows how earlier philosophy influences later philosophy. Philosophy is embedded in a cultural context, and for this reason Russell provides connections between the thoughts of philosophers and the events of their time periods. Russell's history was well received when it was published as an important comprehensive survey of Western philosophy. No doubt Russell has also been faulted for bias, flaws in his understanding of philosophers and historical periods, and omissions—and his survey also stops in the early 1940s. Nonetheless, his work has stood the test of time because it is scholarly and highly readable, and it provides a credible view of the sweep of philosophical history by an author who is himself a respected philosopher.

### Perspective and Narrator

_A History of Western Philosophy_ is written in the third person, for the most part in the past tense. The author frequently interjects his own opinions in this survey, and when he does he often uses present tense.

### About the Title

The author calls his book _A History of Western Philosophy_ to emphasize he is writing about philosophers within their historical contexts. This is a historical as well as philosophical text.

# Main Ideas

## Relationship between History and Philosophy

The understanding of both philosophy and history requires the teasing out of how they mutually influence each other. In the introduction to this treatise Bertrand Russell says philosophy is something like an "intermediate between theology and science." The business of philosophy is to study the questions science cannot easily answer, such as, "Is there a way of living that is noble and another that is base, or are all ways of living merely futile?" If it is difficult—if not impossible—to answer such questions, then why do human beings continue to study them? The answer lies in history. The circumstances of human life help determine their philosophy, and at the same time philosophy influences those specifics or circumstances. Thus, history and philosophy are reciprocal, and that symbiotic relationship is the main topic of Russell's survey of Western thought.

In his examination of Western philosophy Russell shows how "social cohesion and individual liberty, like religion and science, are in a state of conflict or uneasy compromise throughout the period." Principles of governmental organization come from the city-state in Greece, for example, which limited the freedom of individuals under democracy. Plato imagines what, in his view, is a more perfect state in the _Republic_. While Aristotle finds all governments bad, he offers a qualified defense of democracy. After Alexander the Great conquers Greece, philosophers turn from the social to the individual ethic. For example, the Stoics see a virtuous life as an individual affair and concentrate on how a person can be good in a wicked world. Such ideas are carried over to Christianity, which popularizes the belief that man's duty to God comes before his duty to the state. This idea shapes Catholic philosophy and explains the push-pull power relations between Church and state once Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire in the 4th century. These are examples of how Russell provides a historical lens through which the reader can understand and contextualize the ideas of philosophers. The author consistently shows how history shapes philosophy and vice versa, examining the ideas of Western philosophy in light of their contexts.

## Rationalism versus Empiricism

While Bertrand Russell rarely uses the term _rationalism_ (and sometimes uses the term _subjectivism_ instead), he shows throughout his treatise the tug-of-war between what is often called rationalist philosophy and empiricist philosophy. (Russell uses the term _empiricism_ quite often.) Rationalists say knowledge is gained partially or entirely through the mind, independent of the senses, while empiricists say knowledge comes entirely through sensory experience.

Russell locates this dichotomy as far back as the Greeks, who have a commonsense empirical side and a religious and mystical side. By the 17th century René Descartes formalized this dichotomy by splitting the human being into two substances, mind and matter, and putting subjective man at the center of philosophy, "from which the external world is to be inferred." The rationalist philosophers who followed Descartes were themselves followed by the empirical philosophers. David Hume, the last and most important, went to the other extreme, overturning the very idea that there is a scientific basis for inductive reasoning and claiming man can know for sure very little indeed—and only what is fed to him by his paltry senses. Hume was followed by other philosophers who attempted to correct him, and Western philosophers are not finished with this argument.

## Autocracy versus Democracy

Russell sees the movement of history as one in which human beings form social organizations that can sufficiently control individuals, even while individuals struggle to assert their freedom. This state of affairs is inevitable, given that human beings desire freedom and at the same time are often a danger to themselves and others. The human dilemma of freedom versus control, along with people's innate desire to live in community, is naturally the subject of philosophy. Moreover, the growth of science and technology has affected both people's ability to exercise more freedom as well as the state's ability to exercise more control. Scientific advancement has affected the way people live in community, which in turn has affected philosophy. At the same time, philosophers living in various time periods are affected by the social organizations in which they are embedded, which in turn affect the way they see the world and the philosophies they produce. Russell includes a long section on John Locke for this reason. While Locke was far from a stellar philosopher (his thinking is often contradictory and piecemeal), his influence was profound. Russell calls him the first of the empiricist philosophers. Locke also invented liberalism, which is the way modern societies find a happy medium of sorts between social control (autocracy) and individual freedom (democracy).

## Romantic Roots of Totalitarian States

Bertrand Russell makes a case that 19th-century Romantic thinking is the seedbed for ideas that result in the rise of totalitarian states. He is a philosopher and political activist writing in 1943, and his treatise is colored by concerns about World War II being fought between republican governments (the Allies), particularly the United States and Great Britain, and fascist governments (the Axis), particularly Germany and Italy. This war is a fight against a world takeover by Adolf Hitler's fascism, which is a very real threat in the first part of the conflict. In addition to imposing a harsh, absolutist government, Germany is killing millions of people in concentration camps and singling out entire ethnicities for extermination—the Jews and Gypsies of Europe.

Russell is a dedicated pacifist, but he decides in 1940 that fighting Hitler is the lesser of two evils (the first being world fascism). He sees the glorification of an absolutist German state as naturally growing out of the ideas of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Friedrich Nietzsche. Moreover, he sees Nietzsche's ideas as part of the Romantic movement, which began in Great Britain. Russell includes George Gordon Byron in his survey, not because he is a philosopher but rather because he exemplifies the Romantic attitude. Romantics revolt against tradition, but they are aristocratic rebels, not sympathetic supporters of the working class. Byron and other Romantics glorified conquerors like Napoleon Bonaparte, who subjects much of Europe in the early 19th century before he is finally stopped (at Waterloo in 1815). Such people have a lot in common with Lucifer in John Milton's _Paradise Lost_; they would rather rule in hell than subject themselves to a benevolent God (or less metaphorically, to a government in which power is shared). In Russell's view "the romantic revolt passes from Byron, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche to Mussolini and Hitler."

# Context

## Ancient Philosophy and Geography  

In reading the first part of [Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/)'s philosophy covering the early Greeks (Book 1), he often mentions places where philosophers were born, lived, or worked. Russell's history begins roughly in 585 BCE (Russell uses the designation BC), with the philosopher Thales. Greece is located in southern Europe, mostly on the Balkan Peninsula, although Greece is not a Balkan state from a political perspective. Mainland Greece is located below modern Albania, Macedonia, and Bulgaria, on the bottom on the peninsula. Greece has some 2,000 islands. The country is bordered by the Mediterranean, Aegean, and Ionian seas. Crete is the largest of the Greek islands, the place where Minoan culture originated and then spread to the mainland. Russell speaks about the spread of Greek culture to Sicily and southern Italy (current-day Sicily is part of Italy), and some Greek philosophers lived in or originated from Sicily and southern Italy. Sicily is about 500 miles across the Ionian Sea from mainland Greece.

Russell mentions that in the 6th century BCE, when the epics of Greek poet Homer were being fixed, similar cultural events were going on in other parts of the world. In fact this period of history is referred to as the "Axial Age," in which intellectual and religious thought blossomed in many parts of the inhabited world, from 800 to 200 BCE. Some of the great figures of this period are Chinese philosophers Confucius and Lao Tzu, Nepali sage Siddhartha Gautama (later called the Buddha), the sages who wrote the Indian Upanishads, and Iranian prophet Zarathustra. Russell also mentions Egypt, where many Greek philosophers traveled to study. Egypt, a country in northern Africa, was a major center of learning in the ancient world. Thales was a native of Asia Minor, which refers to the peninsula in Asia that is part of the country of Turkey. [Aristotle](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Aristotle) was born in Thrace, which is mostly part of modern Bulgaria and the European part of Turkey. Alexander the Great was a Macedonian king, born in Pella, which is now in Greece. He conquered the Persian Empire, centered in modern Iran. The Greeks borrowed the Phoenician alphabet, and Greek philosopher Zeno is from Phoenicia, which corresponds to Lebanon in the Middle East and parts of Syria and Israel. Other important civilizations in the ancient world mentioned by Russell are the Babylonians (Iraq; specifically the river valley culture between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers) and Mesopotamians (Iraq or ancient Babylonia plus Kuwait, the eastern parts of Syria, and southeastern Turkey).

## Catholic Philosophy

Bertrand Russell devotes Book 2 to Catholic philosophy. To better understand the historical context in the founding and development of Catholic philosophy, it helps to have more information than Russell provides on both Christianity and the Roman Empire. He assumes a lot of prior knowledge on the part of his readers.

#### The Birth of Christianity

When Russell uses the term _Catholic_, he is mostly referring to Roman Catholicism, which was the form of Christianity that spread in the Western Roman Empire. Christianity came into existence as a religion after the death of its founding figure, Jesus Christ, a Jewish rabbi and sage born in Bethlehem in modern Palestine on the West Bank, a territory occupied by modern Israel. One of the early proponents of the teachings of Jesus was Paul (originally Saul) of Tarsus, in modern-day Turkey. The early missionaries of the Jesus movement spread their interpretations of the teachings, which was at first a Jewish movement. As the message spread to the Gentiles (non-Jews), the Jesus movement became its own religion.

The first usage of the term _Christian_ can be found in the Acts of the Apostles in the New Testament of the Judeo-Christian Bible. The Christian Bible includes both the New Testament and the Old Testament, which is somewhat equivalent to the Hebrew Bible, the scripture of the Jews. The books included in the Old Testament differ slightly from those included in the Hebrew Bible. Christianity spread through Asia Minor (Turkey) and the Greek cities in the East and to Rome in the West. Christians believed that Jesus was the incarnation of God, also called the second person of God (although Arian Christians did not believe that Jesus was coequal with God the father). Russell doesn't refer to Arian Christians as Christians but simply as Arians.

By the time the Emperor Constantine converted to Christianity and made it the official religion of the Roman Empire in 313 CE, Christianity had already spread throughout the empire, and by 500 CE, most of the people in the Roman Empire were Christian.

#### The Eastern and Western Roman Empire

The Roman Empire was established in 27 BCE under Augustus (Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus) and ended in 476 CE, when the Germanic tribes under Odoacer (whom Russell calls "barbarians") overthrew the last emperor.

At its height the Roman Empire extended as far east as Mesopotamia and Armenia, bordering the Caspian Sea, west to Spain, north to Gaul (modern-day France), and south through North Africa. Third-century civil war fragmented the empire, which was reunited under Emperor Diocletian in the beginning of the 4th century. To rule effectively, however, he was forced to divide this large territory into eastern and western parts. After his death in 311 CE Constantine the Great wrested power from his rivals and reunited the empire, establishing his capital at Byzantium (renamed Constantinople), the site of current-day Istanbul in Turkey. After Emperor Constantine's death his sons fought over the empire. The empire split again after the death of Emperor Jovian in 364 CE. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the Byzantine (Eastern) Empire continued until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in the middle of the 15th century.

#### The Two Schisms

Bertrand mentions the first schism in the Christian Church only once in passing, although he refers to the second schism as the "Great Schism." The first schism further separated the religious philosophies of the Eastern and Western churches. Roman or Latin Christianity came to be exclusively identified with the designation of Catholicism (also called Roman Catholicism) after the first schism in 1054 (also called the East-West Schism).

The immediate cause of the schism was an argument between the pope in Rome and the patriarch of Constantinople (the highest church official in the East but still subordinate to the pope) about enforcing Western church customs on the Greek Catholics in southern Italy. The Eastern churches also resented the imposition of priestly celibacy, which the Western church had begun to enforce in the 11th century. Finally, there was a disagreement about whether the Holy Spirit, the third person of God, proceeds from only the Father (the first person of God) or the Father and the Son (Jesus, the second person of God). In truth the Eastern and Western churches had begun to grow apart as early as the 5th century, because, as scholars note, Eastern theology had partial roots in Greek philosophy while Western theology had partial roots in Roman law. The schism was also a result of a growing power struggle in which the Western church sought to establish its sole authority. The resulting breach was inevitable, resulting in the Orthodox churches of the East.

The second schism occurred only in the Western church and grew out of power struggles among rival popes. The Western Schism (also called the Great Schism or the Great Western Schism) refers to the papal rivalry between 1378 and 1417, when two and then three popes vied for power with their attendant cardinals (ecclesiastics or clergymen who are elevated to the highest rank beneath the pope). In 1309 Pope Clement VII, a friend of the French king Philip IV, was persuaded to move the papal court to Avignon, papal lands just outside of France. The papacy stayed in Avignon until 1377, when Pope Gregory XI moved it back to Rome. This event triggered a power struggle for the papacy. The schism ended when members of the conciliar movement forced the arguing popes to resign and saw that Martin V was elected to the office. The successful intervention in the papal dispute by the conciliar movement helped to break the political stranglehold of the Roman Church, which lost a significant amount of power in the 15th century.

## Russell and Modern Philosophy

As a neutral monist, Bertrand Russell is not strictly a materialist philosopher: his position is that the world consists of one type of substance, neither exclusively mental nor physical. However, his work on logic and mathematics and his role as a founder of analytic philosophy places him in the camp of philosophical empiricists. Empiricists claim the only knowledge human beings can acquire is based on data that comes in through the senses. Analytical philosophy begins with the idea that language often does not accurately represent reality. Therefore, the analytic philosopher emphasizes clarity and precision in language and the use of formal logic and conceptual analysis in understanding and representing the world. Although Russell has respect for certain types of metaphysical or religious thinking, he does not think there is any truth in such viewpoints. Thus, he rejects views of such philosophers as French philosopher René Descartes, who believes in _a priori_ knowledge that exists in the mind prior to experience. He also rejects Immanuel Kant's idea of _a priori_ analytic knowledge, which is knowledge acquired when certain categories that exist in the mind are used to process data arriving through the senses.

Russell believes it is unfortunate that early on in Greek philosophy, beginning with Pythagoras, mathematics was tainted with mystical ideas. He strongly disagrees with [Plato](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Plato)'s view that true knowledge cannot be known through the senses and decries the long influence of Plato on Western philosophy. Aristotle also comes in for serious criticism, particularly for his misunderstandings in logic and for the fact that his faulty logic still widely influences thinking in many disciplines. In reading Russell's critiques and analysis of various philosophers, it is helpful to keep in mind his own philosophical stance and biases.

Also important in understanding Russell's history and critique of Western philosophers is to remain aware of his political biases as well as the time period in which he wrote. Russell was a committed Socialist, which means he believed that wealth should primarily be owned by the community of people and individuals should not be able to amass vast amounts of capital primarily to benefit themselves. He was also a committed pacifist, although after 1940 he supported the war against Nazi Germany as the lesser of two evils. In addition, he believed that only a world government could solve the problem of continual war. Finally, he blamed the German philosophers, particularly [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Friedrich_Nietzsche) and Georg Hegel, for the rise of Nazism, and he saw the Romantic movement as the precursor to the glorification of the nation-state, which allowed for the rise of absolutist totalitarian regimes in both Germany and the Soviet Union. The Romantic movement, beginning in the late 18th century and continuing through the mid-19th century, rejected the rational and democratic world order advocated by the Enlightenment philosophers in favor of the subjective, irrational, and disordered worlds of individuals. Romanticism is related to the nation-state through the glorification of individualist world conquerors, such as Napoleon Bonaparte.

All of Russell's assumptions and biases need to be kept in mind when reading his history of philosophy. Finally, the reader must remember that Russell was living through one of the darkest periods of human history. Although _A History of Western Philosophy_ was published in 1945, Russell wrote it between 1940 and 1943, during the somber days of World War II (1939–45). By then the Allies (Great Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union) were fairly certain they would ultimately win against the axis powers (Germany, Italy, and Japan), but people like Russell were assessing the extent of the horrific, mechanized killing that had been and was still going on—on both the battlefield and in concentration camps (where millions of noncombatants, including Europe's Jews and Roma, targeted for extermination, were being killed by the German state). In some instances Russell seems to see both behind and ahead as he worries about the future abuses of unlimited power in the hands of human beings and the ways in which faulty thinking can put civilization on a path to destruction.

### Preface and Introduction

[Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) announces his purpose, which is to show philosophy is part of the fabric of social and political life. Philosophical speculation cannot be isolated from its historical context, so he plans to take the reader through Western philosophy by examining his philosophical exposition against a historical context. In the [Introduction](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/introduction-summary/) Russell defines philosophy as a liminal space between theology and science. He will cover three periods of Western philosophy, beginning with the ancient Greeks. He also explains that civilization is equally threatened by too much "reverence for tradition" and too much individualism and hostility toward cooperation. In his survey of philosophy he will show how these opposing trends play themselves out in philosophical thinking. This is a perennial theme in the history of the Western world.

### Book 1: Ancient Philosophy

Western philosophy's beginning is marked as 585 BCE, the year in which the philosopher Thales predicted an eclipse. Russell divides ancient philosophy into the Pre-Socratics (Part 1); [Socrates](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Socrates), [Plato](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Plato), and [Aristotle](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Aristotle) (Part 2); and Ancient Philosophy after Aristotle (Part 3). In Part 1 Russell provides another introduction—this one on Greek civilization—and explains how two streams of thought became prominent in philosophy. The first stream involves mysticism and originates in the Dionysian and Orphic religious cults, alternative religions in Greece. The religion of mysticism involves inducing altered states of consciousness and positing a complex, immaterial world beyond the senses. The second stream is empirical and scientific, based on commonsense observation of the external world. The first philosophers belong to the Milesian School, including Thales, Anaximenes, and Anaximander. These philosophers are concerned with the nature of substances. They are followed by Pythagoras, among the most important of philosophers because of his contributions to mathematics, and Xenophanes, Heraclitus, Parmenides, and Empedocles.

The golden age of Athens begins at the end of the 5th century BCE, when Athens defeats the Persians and becomes a prosperous state under Pericles. The important philosophers of the early 6th century include Anaxagoras, Democritus, and Leucippus (the most important atomists), and Protagoras, an important philosopher in the Skeptical school of sophism. The Sophists teach young Greek aristocrats how to argue.

Socrates is the teacher of Plato and Plato the teacher of Aristotle. Most of what is known about Socrates comes through the dialogues written by Plato, primarily, and secondarily from the writings of Xenophon, another of his pupils. Russell notes it is difficult to tease out the thinking of the historical Socrates from Plato's own thinking. Russell identifies Socrates with the mystical trend in Greek philosophy, which carries over into Plato's philosophy. Russell provides a chapter on Sparta. The culture of Sparta influences the thinking of Plato and is idealized by the Roman historian Plutarch. Plutarch in turn influences writers and philosophers of the European Romantic period. Russell also devotes a chapter to the sources of Plato's opinions and notes Christian philosophy until the 13th century is more Platonic than Aristotelian. Plato's _Republic_ is his most important work, in which he imagines the ideal commonwealth, which is far from a democracy. Plato's theory of ideas is a key concept in Western philosophy, in which he posits a world of ideal forms—of which the physical world is a mere copy. Plato distinguishes between knowledge and perception and asserts true knowledge cannot be derived from the senses. Aristotle replaces this theory with a theory of universals, or one-of-a-kind things, distinguishing form from matter and providing four causes for all things. Russell spends time refuting Aristotle's antiquated logic that though remarkable is also faulty.

After a long discussion of Aristotle over several chapters, Russell devotes a chapter to Greek mathematics and astronomy. He provides a prefatory chapter on the Hellenistic world under Alexander the Great before turning to the Cynics and Skeptics. These philosophers are affected by the loss of democracy and "the eclipse of the City State" after Alexander conquers the known world. In turn the thinking of these philosophers, which turns inward, has an effect on the "other-worldliness" of the Christian era. Diogenes is the founder of the Cynics, and Pyrrho is the founder of the Skeptics. Epicurus founds a kind of cult in which people must adhere to a strict and dogmatic creed that is the opposite of hedonism. Zeno founds the philosophy of Stoicism, which advises cultivating nonattachment to the world. The Stoic philosophy is later taken up by Romans like Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius. The author ends Book 1 with a summary of the rise of the Roman Empire and how the Roman appropriation of Greek culture affected both history and philosophy. The new religion of Christianity also absorbs Greek culture, particularly in the form of Neoplatonism, whose chief proponent is Plotinus.

### Book 2: Catholic Philosophy

Catholic philosophy dominates Europe for 10 centuries, and Russell roughly dates this period from 400 to 1400 CE. The first part of the period is colored by the philosophy of Saint Augustine and the Platonists, successors of the Greek philosopher Plato, while the second period is colored by the philosophy of [Saint Thomas Aquinas](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Saint_Thomas_Aquinas), to which has been added Aristotelian influence. Russell devotes a chapter to religious development of the Jews since Judaism is the seedbed of Christianity. Beginning with Constantine, the religion becomes more and more formalized and dogmatic, and Church leaders determine what will constitute orthodox belief. Russell names four Doctors of the Western church—saints Ambrose, Jerome, Augustine, and Gregory the Great. Of these Saint Augustine is the philosopher, whose most important works are _The Confessions_ and _City of God_. Augustine establishes a) the idea that the state must give way to the Church in religious matters, b) the doctrine of predestination, and c) role of Christianity as a champion of the downtrodden.

In the 5th and 6th centuries barbarians from the north overran the Roman Empire and became the new rulers. Eventually the "Holy Roman Empire" is established, first under Charlemagne in 800 CE. Saint Benedict established a monastic tradition in the West in the 6th century, and Pope Gregory the Great informally increased the influence of the papal office while acting as a force against anarchy. During the Dark Ages (roughly 600 to 1000 CE) the pope and the emperor worked out an uneasy interdependence. The most important philosopher of this period is John the Scot, a pantheist who "refuses substantial reality to creatures," believing only in the principle of the One.

Islamic (which Russell calls "Mohammedan") culture and philosophy significantly affected Christian philosophy because Muslims took over parts of Europe and introduced new cultural elements. They brought with them the works of Aristotle in Arabic. These works were then translated for a Western audience, and Aristotle's philosophy thus made its way into Christian philosophy. Saint Thomas Aquinas, the greatest of the Catholic Scholastic philosophers, introduced Aristotle to Christians in the 13th century. In Russell's view Aquinas does a good job of adapting Aristotle to Christian dogma. Aquinas also has "sharpness and clarity" in distinguishing arguments derived from reason and revelation. Other important philosophers of this period were Roger Bacon, Duns Scotus, and William of Occam. In the last chapter of Part 2, Russell sums up the Catholic synthesis and its later disintegration in the 15th century.

### Book 3: Modern Philosophy

Modern philosophy begins with the diminishment of Church authority and the increase in scientific authority. The Church also lost power as a controller of culture because of democratic revolutions in the United States and France and the increasing democratization of other European countries. Finally, the Italian Renaissance ushered in secular culture, which substituted Church authority with the authority of "the ancients." The hegemony of the Catholic Church is shattered for good by the Reformation, which Russell calls a revolt against "the authority of the Pope" as well as a "rebellion of less civilized nations against the intellectual domination of Italy." The Counter-Reformation that followed was a revolt against the secular humanism and immorality of the Italian Renaissance and a movement to end corruption within the Church.

Russell devotes a chapter to the rise of science and the most important men in the field from the 15th through the 17th centuries. In philosophy Francis Bacon straddled the 15th and 16th century and stressed the importance of the inductive method of reasoning for science. Thomas Hobbes was an early empiricist who wrote a book of political philosophy (_Leviathan_) justifying the need for an absolute ruler. René Descartes, the first of the modern philosophers, sought to reconstruct the edifice of philosophy and introduces rationalism and dualism (the body-mind split) to philosophy. He says matter is knowable only through inference and true knowledge is in the mind, not the senses. Additional rationalists—Spinoza and Gottfried Leibniz—followed. Their ideas were challenged by the next group of philosophers, the empiricists, beginning with [John Locke](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#John_Locke), the founder of liberalism. Liberalism seeks to find a compromise between the desire for individual liberty and the need for government control. George Berkeley sought to correct Locke. While Berkeley was an empiricist he nevertheless denied the existence of matter. He was followed by [David Hume](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#David_Hume), who radically overturned rationalist notions and created a dead end in philosophy by credibly proving there is no such thing as a self and induction is a logical principle that cannot be inferred from experience.

Following a discussion of the empiricists, Russell provides background on the Romantic movement, followed by a discussion of philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, whose "appeal to the heart" had a profound effect on philosophy. David Hume's philosophy is challenged by Immanuel Kant, who seeks to inject back into the discussion a place for reason and prove that knowledge is partially _a priori_, or prior to experience. Kant is the first of the German idealist philosophers, followed by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Two other important German philosophers are Arthur Schopenhauer and [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Friedrich_Nietzsche). Russell faults Romanticism and German idealism for laying the groundwork for the rise of the German autocratic state. In Russell's view the ideas of Rousseau and Lord Byron (a Romantic writer) passed to philosophers like Schopenhauer and Nietzsche and fascist leaders Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler.

Philosophers picking up the liberal tradition were utilitarians such as Jeremy Bentham, who argued for the government producing "harmony between public and private interests." In the field of science Charles Darwin's theory of evolution had an effect on philosophy. Early socialist ideas preceded philosopher and economic theorist Karl Marx, who also was influenced by Hegel's notion of the dialectic.

A leading philosopher of the first part of the 20th century was Henri Bergson, whose philosophy Russell entirely discounts. The American pragmatists William James and John Dewey are in the same time period, and Russell faults Dewey especially for attempting to replace "truth" with "inquiry." The last chapter of Russell's treatise covers the analytic philosophers, who are mathematicians and logicians. Russell is among their number. The author ends by saying analytic philosophers acknowledge that philosophy cannot satisfactorily answer questions about how to live, but they do not believe in a "higher" knowledge that is not a product of the intellect. Yet they can still "suggest and inspire a way of life."

## Summary

### Book 1, Part 1, Chapter 1: The Rise of Greek Civilization

"Much of what makes civilization had already existed for thousands of years in Egypt and in Mesopotamia, and had spread thence to neighboring countries," says [Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/), in accounting for the rise of Greek civilization. Nonetheless, the Greeks "invented mathematics and science and philosophy; they first wrote history as opposed to mere annals; they speculated freely about the nature of the world and the ends of life."

Philosophy and science began around the 6th century BCE, and Thales is known as the first Greek philosopher. From 2500 to 1400 BCE, the artistically advanced Minoan culture flourished in Crete. Minoan culture spread to mainland Greece, where it survived until about 900 BCE. The mainland culture is called Mycenaean—depicted in the epics of Homer. It is uncertain to what degree the Mycenaeans owe their civilization to the Cretans or even if the Mycenaeans were Greek (and spoke some form of that language). Three successive waves of Greek-speaking invaders come to Greece: the Ionians, Achaeans, and Dorians. The religion of classical Greece was a blend of the Indo-European religion of the Dorians and the earlier religion of the Mycenaeans. The Dorians continued to spread beyond Greece into Sicily and southern Italy.

Greek society evolved into an aristocracy and then alternated between tyranny (nonhereditary rule by one man) and democracy (rule by citizens). Greek writing probably began around the 10th century BCE and borrowed the Phoenician alphabet. The first "notable product of the Hellenic civilization" was Homer. The poems attributed to him, the _Iliad_ and the _Odyssey_, were probably written over a 200-year period, between 750 and 550 BCE. During the 6th century BCE the Homeric poems became fixed, and philosophy and mathematics began. Similar events were happening in other parts of the world, with Confucius, Buddha, and Zoroaster coming of age in the same century.

Greece comprised a number of independent city-states, but only a small number of cities developed Hellenistic culture. Dionysus or Bacchus was originally a Thracian God and fertility figure. Eventually, Bacchus's fertility functions were subordinated to his status as the god of intoxication and "divine madness." When the cult of Bacchus migrated to Greece, his rite retained barbaric elements, such as tearing wild animals to pieces. The cult of Bacchus served as a corrective to overcivilization. A more spiritualized form of the "religion of Bacchus," associated with Orpheus, had an influence on Greek philosophy, according to Russell. The ascetic Orphic cult created an elaborate theology and substituted mental for physical intoxication. Its mystical elements "entered into Greek philosophy with Pythagoras," an early philosopher and reformer. The commonsense empirical side of the Greeks along with their religious and mystical sides (as seen in the Dionysian and Orphic cults) both influenced philosophy.

### Book 1, Part 1, Chapter 2: The Milesian School

Thales was a native of Miletus in Asia Minor and the first known Greek philosopher. He may have traveled to Egypt and brought back to the Greeks a rudimentary knowledge of geometry. According to [Aristotle](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Aristotle), Thales thought water was the original substance from which all others were formed. The second philosopher of the Milesian school, Anaximander, held all things come from one primal substance, which he believed is transformed into all other substances. These substances were then transformed into one another. The substances "make reparation and satisfaction to one another for their injustice according to the ordering of time," according to Anaximander. He saw the elements as constantly trying to enlarge their territory while nature keeps them in balance. Russell explains that the idea of justice as not overstepping "eternally fixed bounds" is a profound belief among the Greeks. Even the gods are subject to justice, an impersonal supreme power. Anaximenes was the third of the trio of important Milesian philosophers, succeeding Anaximander. For him the fundamental substance is air.

## Analysis

[Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) mentions that the Greeks invented mathematics but does include a footnote saying arithmetic and some geometry existed among the Egyptians and Babylonians, mainly as "rules of thumb." He says deductive reasoning from general premises is something the Greeks invented. While Russell clearly gives credit to Egypt and Mesopotamia, and in more than one place mentions philosophers who may have studied in Egypt, he perhaps does not give Egyptians enough credit. According to more recent scholarship, Egypt may have had more of an influence on Greek philosophy than originally thought. Beginning in 1987, Martin Bernal, an expert in Chinese, published _Black Athena:_ _The Afroasiatic Roots of Classical Civilization_ in four volumes. Bernal argues that classical civilization came from Egypt and Phoenician and Hebraic sources and speculates that racism colored scholars' assessments of African and the Middle Eastern influence in developing so-called Western civilization. The extent of these influences continues to be debated by classical scholars.

Russell is clearly writing a history of Western philosophy; nonetheless, both philosophy and science were going on in other parts of the world. While Russell mentions in passing the coming of age of philosophers in other parts of the world, it is important to understand that a great flowering of intellectual thought took place from 800 to 200 BCE. This period of history, referred to as the "Axial Age," saw great strides in philosophy in various parts of the world.

Russell mentions the importance of the cult of Bacchus or Dionysius, which adds a mystical element to Greek religion and is transferred to philosophy, counterbalancing the rational approach of the Milesian school. The intoxication sanctioned by Bacchus allows his followers to tap into the intuitive, unconscious side of their psyches, which give access to a nonrational type of knowledge. The religion of Bacchus is replaced by the more refined asceticism of the Orphic cults. Like the cult of Bacchus, Orphism is an alternative religion. The mainstream religion is belief in the various gods of Zeus's heaven. As early as the 6th century BCE, the Milesian philosophers are speculating about substances, or the most basic of realities, to understand the nature of the world. Russell notes these philosophers have contact with Egypt and Babylonia, and their speculations are early scientific hypotheses, without "any undue intrusion of anthropomorphic desires and moral ideas." Thus, the Milesians represent the scientific, empirical current of Greek philosophy, while the Dionysian and Orphic cults represent the idealistic and mystical current.

## Summary

### Book 1, Part 1, Chapter 3: Pythagoras

According to [Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/), Pythagoras is one of the most important men who ever lived. "Mathematics, in the sense of demonstrative deductive argument, begins with him, and in him is intimately connected with a peculiar form of mysticism." Russell says Pythagoras was partially responsible for the unfortunate influence of mathematics on philosophy. Pythagoras founded a religion and taught that the soul is immortal and transmigrates from life to life. In his circle of discipleship, he admitted men and women equally, and they held property in common.

From Pythagoras came the idea that pure mathematics is the result of intuitive thought, and much that is "mistaken in metaphysics and theory of knowledge" began with Pythagoras, says Russell. Pythagoras's greatest discovery was that the square of the length of the longest side of a right triangle (the hypotenuse) is equal to the sum of the square of the other two sides of the triangle. The Pythagorean Theorem raised other problems, which led the Greeks to establish geometry as a study separate from arithmetic. Geometry, in its turn, had a profound influence on philosophy and the scientific method, since it begins with self-evident axioms and proceeds with deductive reasoning to arrive at theorems that are not self-evident. Russell claims mathematics is "the chief source of the belief in eternal and exact truth, as well as in a super-sensible intelligible world." This combination of mathematics and theology influenced philosophy down through the philosopher Immanuel Kant.

### Book 1, Part 1, Chapter 4: Heraclitus

Bertrand Russell begins Chapter 4 by acknowledging the importance of geometry to modern science but also says the Greeks relied too heavily on deductive reasoning; only slowly did inductive reasoning based on observation take its rightful place in scientific thought. The philosopher Xenophanes, who came between Pythagoras and Heraclitus, believed all things are made of earth and water. He also believed in one God unlike human beings in form and thought. Russell calls him an early rationalist. Heraclitus is famous for his doctrine "everything is in a state of flux." Heraclitus believed in war and strife as inevitable and necessary, and Russell compares him to [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Friedrich_Nietzsche). "Heraclitus values power obtained through self-mastery, and despises the passions that distract men from their central ambitions," says Russell. Heraclitus also believed in the importance of mingling opposites, prefiguring the German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel in this regard.

### Book 1, Part 1, Chapter 5: Parmenides

While Heraclitus taught everything changes, Parmenides said nothing changes. Parmenides is known for inventing a metaphysics based on logic. According to this philosopher, sensible things are an illusion, and the only thing with true being is "the One," which is "material and extended," even though it cannot be divided. In Parmenides's metaphysics, anything that can be thought or spoken "must exist at all times." This is why he says nothing changes. In the case of imaginary objects, what is "real" is that something is imagined and named. What subsequent philosophers took from Parmenides is the idea that substance is indestructible, although the word _substance_ does not enter philosophical vocabulary until much later. The idea of substance as a "persistent subject of varying predicates" became a ruling idea "for more than two thousand years," says Russell.

### Book 1, Part 1, Chapter 6: Empedocles

Empedocles also lived in the 5th century BCE and is remembered for "his discovery of air as a separate substance," which he proves by showing that a bucket or similar vessel put upside down in water does not fill up with water. Empedocles claims that the four elements of earth, air, fire, and water are everlasting and "could be mixed in different proportions" to produce the myriad substances found in the world. Empedocles believes nature is "regulated by chance and necessity rather than by purpose," and in that respect he is more scientific than religious.

## Analysis

Early Greek philosophers are influenced by Asian sources, and most likely by the metaphysics of early Persian (Iranian) texts. Heraclitus and Pythagoras are influenced by Persian religious ideas. While monotheism is thought to be a new idea originating in Judeo-Christian religion, Parmenides is expressing a similar idea in his teaching of "the One." Monotheistic ideas also appear in Xenophanes, [Plato](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Plato), and [Aristotle](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Aristotle). Parmenides is expressing a similar idea in his teaching of "the One." Monotheistic ideas also appear in Xenophanes, Plato, and Aristotle. And while [Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) credits Pythagoras for discovering the famous theorem, it is likely that the Babylonians had arrived at the same discovery a least 1,000 years prior. Moreover, proofs of the theorem appear in both Chinese and Indian texts. Nonetheless, it is Pythagoras who established the theorem in Western philosophy and opens the path for Euclid's geometry. Geometry is important for philosophy and the scientific method because the axioms and theorems "are held to be true of actual space, which is something given in experience," Russell explains. This taught philosophers that it was possible to notice something self-evident in the world and then use deduction to find out additional things about the physical world.

Russell claims that the belief in a perfect, intelligible world beyond the senses comes chiefly from mathematics because when things are actually measured, the measurement can never exactly correspond to a mathematical concept. Thus a perfect circle exists only as a concept in geometry. This suggests that "exact reasoning applies to ideal as opposed to sensible objects," further leading to the speculation that thought is higher than sensory data and "objects of thought [are] more real than those of sense-perception." Furthermore, numbers may be viewed as eternal and out of time. Thus, while Russell's view that mathematics inspires theology may at first seem overstated, upon closer inspection it appears valid in the context of how theology evolved in the West. Russell further states that Platonism is nothing but Pythagoreanism—meaning Plato's concept of a world of ideal forms follows from the same presuppositions derived from Pythagoras's view of mathematics.

Russell also lays at Pythagoras's door the addition of mysticism to philosophy, since he was a prophet as well as a mathematician. This assertion on Russell's part also seems reasonable, since many philosophers who follow Pythagoras, from Plato to Kant, do blend "religion and reasoning" as Russell claims, and their "intellectualized theology" is different from the "straightforward mysticism of Asia." It is important to keep in mind that for Russell, the mixing of mathematics and theology and mysticism and philosophy is a bad thing, in the sense that it results in untruths and faulty views of reality. While Russell admires the genius of Pythagoras and appreciates his mathematical discoveries, he finds unfortunate the turn that Western philosophy takes as a result of Pythagoras's views. This is because Russell stands firmly in the empiricist camp and is skeptical of anything that is said to exist outside of the world of sense experience.

Heraclitus said everything is in constant flux, while Parmenides said nothing changes. These opposing views are interesting and important, prefiguring later arguments about space and time that take place in both philosophy and science. Both philosophers are material monists: Heraclitus believed everything originated from fire while Parmenides believed everything originated from "the One." Parmenides is important for being the first to use logic to create a metaphysical system, reasoning that, since everything that exists must be eternal, it follows that nothing changes.

## Summary

### Book 1, Part 1, Chapter 7: Athens in Relation to Culture

The golden age of Athens began around 490 BCE, after the city defeated the Persian king Darius at Marathon. Athens became rich and prosperous under Pericles, who ruled for 30 years until his fall in 430 BCE. In the age of Pericles Greek tragedy was born, and the "father of history," Herodotus, wrote an account of the Persian wars. The temples on the Acropolis were rebuilt, and [Socrates](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Socrates) came to manhood. "Most of [Plato](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Plato)'s dialogues are supposed by him to take place during the time of Pericles," according to [Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/). Athens was a democracy, but in practice power was mostly in the hands of the aristocracy. Athens lost its ascendency for a number of reasons. Athenians began to demand more political power, and government policies caused friction with Sparta, which led to the Peloponnesian War (431–04 BCE), in which Athens is defeated. Nonetheless, the city retained its cultural prestige, particularly in the area of philosophy, for at least a millennium.

### Book 1, Part 1, Chapter 8: Anaxagoras

Anaxagoras was the first to claim mind is the "primary cause of physical changes." He claims everything is "infinitely divisible ... and ... even the smallest portion of matter contains some of each element." He agreed with Empedocles that there is no such thing as a void, since air exists (for example, in an inflated skin) where there appears to be nothing. _Mind_ is a substance that "enters into the composition of living things" and has power over all that is imbued with life. Except for mind, everything is made up of opposites.

### Book 1, Part 1, Chapter 9: The Atomists

Leucippus (d. 370 BCE) and Democritus were the founders of atomism—although Leucippus is a shadowy figure, and more is known about Democritus. Democritus traveled widely, spending a lot of time in Egypt and visiting Persia. Atomism was an attempt to mediate between monism and pluralism, says Russell, as represented by Parmenides and Empedocles, respectively. Atomists believed everything is made of atoms that are physically indivisible, indestructible, eternal, and always in motion. Atoms are infinite and come in different shapes; between them is empty space (a void). The atomists saw no need to provide causation for the original motion of atoms, explaining the world "without introducing the notion of purpose or final cause." Their choice of a mechanistic question (What caused this event?) over a teleological question (What is the purpose of this event?) put the atomists in the materialistic, scientific camp, in Russell's view.

The atomists wanted to reconcile the argument of Parmenides—that nothing changes—with the empirical observations that things move and change. If things did change, then there must be a void in which change occurs. Empedocles's discovery that air exists where there appears to be nothing appears to have reinforced Parmenides's argument that the world is a plenum with no possibility of movement. The atomists insisted that since motion can be observed, there must be a void, although it is not corporeal. This seems to have solved the problem for them.

Russell then briefly traces the evolution of thought about space and matter until the modern era (the early 1940s) and notes that the atomists' ideas are somewhat akin to Isaac Newton's idea of absolute space, which was overturned by Albert Einstein's physics. In Russell's view the atomists, particularly Democritus, were the last of the Greek philosophers to embody a scientific attitude. After that philosophy became gradually decadent, with "an undue emphasis on man as compared with the universe."

### Book 1, Part 1, Chapter 10: Protagoras

Protagoras was chief among the skeptical Sophists. The Sophists made their living teaching young men useful skills, particularly how to speak in public on their own behalf. Protagoras was best known for teaching that "man is the measure of all things, of things that are that they are, and of things that are not that they are not." He argued there is no such thing as objective truth. To many ancient Greeks the Sophists seemed immoral because they were concerned with winning and were willing to follow an argument wherever it led. In that sense they were intellectually honest. Plato disliked the Sophists, since his purpose was to promote views that he believed would make people more virtuous.

## Analysis

Prior to the Age of Pericles, the philosophers came from Ionia (coastal Anatolia in present-day Turkey) and the Greek cities of southern Italy and Sicily. After the war against the Persians, the center of Greek philosophy was Athens. The Greeks defeated both Darius and his son Xerxes, but their ascendency is cut short by the Peloponnesian War with Sparta. To say that Athens prior to the war is a democracy ruled by an aristocracy means that Greek men who were citizens and at least 20 years old could vote. Neither women nor slaves could vote. In practice aristocrats were disproportionately represented on the main governing council, whose duties include deciding what issues will be brought before the Assembly.

The atomist philosophers are important because they represent an early empiricist view. They were more concerned with speculating about the ultimate purpose of a phenomenon and less interested in its cause. Further, they tried to reconcile the metaphysical view of Parmenides, that nothing changes, with the evidence of their own senses. They could clearly see that things change, and they attempted to account for that change. Thus they decided that the universe cannot be a plenum as assumed by Parmenides but must contain a void so that things can move around.

[Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) compares early ideas of philosophers about space and time until Isaac Newton—a 17th-century mathematician and the father of modern physics. Newton asserted that there is absolute space distinct from relative motion, while Albert Einstein's theory of relativity predicted distance between events rather than objects and involves both space and time. It is a "causal conception, and in modern physics there is no action at a distance," Russell says. In adding to Russell's explanation, Einstein posited space-time as a fourth dimension. Gravity bends space and makes it seem as if action takes place at a distance when in fact it does not. Modern physics does not call space a void, but rather a vacuum where there are no stars or planets. Nonetheless, at first glance it seems hard to tell the difference between a vacuum and the void posited by the atomists. According to one view in modern physics, 68 percent of space is made up of dark energy and 27 percent of it is dark matter, with everything else accounting for 5 percent of what is in space. According to another theory, "empty space" is full of virtual particles that continuously form and disappear. Thus is appears that one way or another, space is not empty.

# Book 1, Part 2, Chapters 11–13 : Ancient Philosophy (Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle) | Summary

## Summary

### Book 1, Part 2, Chapter 11: Socrates

History knows about [Socrates](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Socrates) only through his pupils, primarily [Plato](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Plato) and Xenophon. Socrates was "an Athenian citizen of moderate means, who spent his time in disputation, and taught philosophy to the young, but not for money, like the Sophists." He was condemned to death for impiety and corrupting the young and died at age 70.

With Plato it is difficult to know how much he portrays the real Socrates and how much he uses his teacher as the "mouthpiece of his own opinions." The dialogue of the _Apology_, which relates Socrates's defense at his trial, is generally considered to be historical. In it Socrates owns up to being the wisest man in Athens because he knows that his wisdom "is worth little or nothing." He exposes pretenders to wisdom out of a sense of duty and calls himself a "gad-fly, given to the state by God." Socrates does not fear death and believes he will migrate "to another world" and "continue his search after knowledge." Russell draws parallels between Socrates and Christian martyrs or Puritans because he feels himself to be guided by an oracle or daimon, which is similar to hearing the voice of God or angels.

Known for his mastery over bodily passions, Socrates seems impervious to heat, cold, and the effects of alcohol and is indifferent to death. "He was the perfect Orphic saint: in the dualism of heavenly soul and earthly body, he had achieved the complete mastery of the soul over the body," says Russell. Socrates does believe knowledge is obtainable and should be sought. Since no man sins on purpose in his view, knowledge is needed to arrive at perfect virtue. This connection between virtue and knowledge is found in Socrates, Plato, and all Greek thought, says Russell. This is different from Christian ethics, which contends that virtue can be found among the ignorant. Socrates refines the dialectic method of seeking knowledge through questions and answers, and "through Plato's influence, most subsequent philosophy has been bounded by the limitations resulting from his method," says Russell. Debates of logic rather than fact can be sorted out through the Socratic method, but it is not helpful in discovering new facts.

### Book 1, Part 2, Chapter 12: The Influence of Sparta

The culture of Sparta is known through both history and myth—the mythical portion fully developed in Plutarch's _Life of Lycurgus_. Russell says this text helped frame the doctrines of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Friedrich_Nietzsche), and Adolph Hitler's National Socialism. The Spartans were a warrior people who conquered Laconia (also Lacedaemon), of which Sparta was the capital, and reduced the conquered people to serfs who worked the land for them. Spartan males were raised from a young age for war, and sickly children were left to die. Both boys and girls were physically trained, and everything that people did, including marrying and procreating, was done for the benefit of the state and to obtain success at war.

What persisted in people's imaginations was not the real Sparta but the one idealized by Plato in his _Republic_, and Plutarch (46–119 CE) some 400 years later, says Russell. Reading these works, people aspired to become philosopher-kings. While the Spartans were excellent fighters, they did nothing to spread Greek culture. Rather, Alexander the Great, a "semi-barbarian," spreads Hellenism throughout the Near East and Asia Minor. Plutarch's works influenced 18th-century European liberalism and American republicanism as well as the Romantic movement in Germany, says Russell. But in Plutarch's account of Lycurgus and Sparta his influence has been categorically bad, he says.

### Book 1, Part 2, Chapter 13: The Sources of Plato's Opinions

In [Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/)'s view Plato and [Aristotle](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Aristotle) are among the most influential of all philosophers, with Plato having more influence "upon subsequent ages." Christian theology until the 13th century is more Platonic than Aristotelian. The most important aspects of Plato's philosophy are his vision of utopia, theory of ideas, arguments in favor of immortality, cosmogony (theory of the origins of the universe), and conception of knowledge as reminiscence instead of perception.

Plato was born in the early days of the Peloponnesian War. A prosperous aristocrat, he was not a supporter of democracy and likely attributed the fall of Athens to this form of government. Moreover, Socrates, his beloved teacher, was put to death by the democracy, so it is not surprising that he looked toward Sparta in imagining an ideal society. Other influences on Plato were Pythagoras, Parmenides, and Heraclitus. Platonic philosophy raised two important questions: (1) "Is there such a thing as 'wisdom'?" and (2) "Granted that there is such a thing, can any constitution be devised that will give it political power?" In Russell's view Plato would likely answer the second question by saying a ruler should be informed by "knowledge of the good." No doubt people will also disagree about the kind of training needed for political wisdom. "The problem of finding a collection of 'wise' men and leaving the government to them is thus an insoluble one," says Russell, which is "the ultimate reason for democracy."

## Analysis

Everything that is known about [Socrates](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Socrates) comes through secondary sources, which is true of most of the pre-Socratic philosophers as well. Texts of the pre-Socratics are mostly fragments. The term _Pre-Socratic_ may also be problematic since some of the early philosophers were contemporaries of Socrates. Socrates himself would not deign to write his philosophy down, so historians have to take [Plato](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Plato)'s word for what Socrates said. Some information also comes through his pupil Xenophon, but [Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) says he is less trustworthy, being somewhat dull witted. However, according to David K. O'Connor, a philosopher at the University of Notre Dame, Xenophon is also a brilliant student of Socrates. After the death of Socrates, a number of his students memorialize his life and conversations using the dialogue genre so familiar in Plato's work, which mimics the way in which Socrates taught philosophy.

Socrates is likely accused of impiety because of his claim he is guided by a divine spirit (daimon), a belief that violated conventional religious beliefs and practices. The charge of corruption of the young is probably based on his criticisms of the current democracy and his friendships with people of the antidemocratic factions in Athens. Socrates disliked democracy because the majority of people were uneducated, and he believes government is an art or a skill that should be entrusted to an intelligent minority. He also is aware of how mob rule can quickly become the norm since masses of people can be easily swayed.

Russell is a Socialist and champion of democracy, and perhaps for this reason he is not overly impressed with Socrates. Russell perhaps somewhat disparagingly calls him an "Orphic saint," although Russell's description as such proves himself, not Socrates, to be a dualist. Rather, Socrates's ability to master his body-mind does not make him a dualist but rather a philosophical master, or if Russell likes, a saint, but not a dualist saint.

Russell says Plato and [Aristotle](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Aristotle) are the most influential of all philosophers in the Western tradition because they are the founders. Both left behind extensive bodies of work, and both integrated the thinking of previous philosophers in creating their own comprehensive philosophical systems. Plato has more influence than Socrates because the people who carried on the Western philosophical tradition—primarily Catholic clergy after the fall of the Roman Empire—had no access to Aristotle's work until the 13th century, when translations became available. There is a little more access to a few of Plato's works, however, as well as to the Neoplatonist Plotinus. These texts are read in Greek by Christian theologians and scholars such as Tertullian, Ambrose, and Boethius. While Aristotle represents the scientific and empirical trend in Western philosophy, Plato represents the mystical, religious, and idealistic trend, so it is no surprise that Western philosophy leaned in the latter direction for hundreds of years, especially given than the torch of philosophy is passed from the Greeks to the Christians.

# Book 1, Part 2, Chapters 14–18 : Ancient Philosophy (Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle) | Summary

## Summary

### Book 1, Part 2, Chapter 14: Plato's Utopia

[Plato](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Plato)'s most important work is the _Republic_. The first part imagines a utopia or ideal commonwealth; the second part defines "philosopher," the type of person who should rule a utopia; and the third part discusses various kinds of constitutions for government. In his ideal society gravity, decorum, and courage are cultivated by way of a strict education and rigid censorship. This means most types of art are prohibited. Plato advocates a type of communism among the guardian (ruling) class and the soldiers, in [Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/)'s view. Plato also advocates the sharing of women and children and complete equality between the sexes, who will receive the same education from the state. Mating takes place according to eugenic principles, and deformed or inferior children are "put away."

In Plato's utopia the state will also lie to the people when necessary for their own good. For Plato justice is somewhat synonymous with "law" as he has construed it. The Sophist Thrasymachus argues that "justice is nothing else than the interest of the stronger," and Russell opines this argument is never adequately refuted. Plato firmly believes in "the Good," whose "nature can be ascertained." He thinks he can prove his ideal state is good while a democrat can prove it is bad, Russell says. Meanwhile, from the Sophist's perspective, the state is good or bad according to whether one likes it, and that decision will be made by force, not reason.

### Book 1, Part 2, Chapter 15: The Theory of Ideas

Russell notes that sections of the _Republic_ have literary beauty, even if the reader disagrees with the actual content of Plato's philosophical ideas. A philosopher, according to Plato, is a lover of wisdom, which is not the same as knowledge. Opinion belongs to the world presented to the senses, while knowledge is apprehension of a super-sensible eternal world. The philosopher loves the "vision of truth," or absolute beauty itself as opposed to beautiful things—which belong to the realm of knowledge. Plato posits a world of forms or ideas. For example, every individual cat partakes of "universal cattyness," which has no position in time or space and is eternal. The word _cat_ refers to an ideal cat created by God. This "cat is real; particular cats are only apparent." Plato distinguishes two types of intellect—reason and understanding: reason is the higher kind, concerned with pure ideas. In the allegory of the cave Plato compares sensible reality to shadows of objects that prisoners in a cave perceive with the help of firelight. Russell argues the distinction between reality and appearance made by Plato and those who followed him is moot, since "if appearance really appears, it is not nothing, and is therefore part of reality."

### Book 1, Part 2, Chapter 16: Plato's Theory of Immortality

Russell uses the _Phaedo_ to discuss Plato's ideas about the afterlife. Death is the separation of the soul and body, which continues Plato's dualism, according to Russell—between reality and appearance, ideas and sensible objects, and reason and sense perception. The distinction between mind and matter continued after Plato in both philosophy and science, Russell notes. Plato attributes to [Socrates](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Socrates) the idea that "the body is a hindrance in the acquisition of knowledge" and "true existence, if revealed to the soul at all, is revealed in thought, not in sense." Russell points out that such a view is a rejection of empirical knowledge, including history and geography. Scientific knowledge and experiment thus become unimportant in the attainment of knowledge. The body is "doubly evil, as a distorting medium ... and as a source of lusts [that] distract us from the pursuit of knowledge." Socrates offers several arguments for the existence of the soul, which Russell finds weak and unconvincing. He says the good go to heaven, the bad to hell, and the intermediate to purgatory. Russell finds the Platonic Socrates to be "dishonest and sophistical in argument," interested in proving what he finds agreeable rather than disinterestedly searching for knowledge.

### Book 1, Part 2, Chapter 17: Plato's Cosmogony

_Timaeus_ lays out Plato's cosmogony or theory of how the universe was formed. "What is unchanging is apprehended by intelligence and reason; what is changing is apprehended by opinion," says Timaeus. God brought the world to order out of disorderly matter and first made the soul before the body. The soul is made up of what is both unchangeable and changeable and is thus a third or intermediate essence. He names two kinds of causes: intelligent causes and those that are moved by others and thus are compelled to also move others. The first has a mind while the second produces chance effects. Russell notes it is difficult to know what Plato means to be taken seriously in this dialogue and what is simply a "play of fancy." Russell says much in this dialogue is "simply silly," albeit influential on ancient and medieval thought.

### Book 1, Part 2, Chapter 18: Knowledge and Perception in Plato

This chapter reiterates Plato's distinction between knowledge and perception, in which true knowledge cannot be derived from the senses. Plato's idea is (1) existence is a property that belongs to everything and (2) the mind can apprehend existence by itself. "Without reaching existence, it is impossible to reach truth," explains Russell, but everything that Plato says about existence is simply bad syntax. Russell says that in the world only particular objects exist while the rest is abstraction. Therefore, the mind cannot be aware of existence in objects.

## Analysis

It is somewhat surprising to read [Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/)'s assessment of [Plato](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Plato), who is generally treated with some degree of reverence by modern-day philosophers and critics.

While Russell says early on that his purpose is to contextualize philosophy within its social and political milieu and to show how history affects philosophy and vice versa, he perhaps has another agenda as well. Russell believes in his own philosophical agenda, and his assessment of the philosophical canon is partly in the service of moving his own philosophical program forward. His philosophy falls squarely in the empirical camp, and he also sees the work of an intellectual as promoting a liberal and democratic outlook and battling autocracy and totalitarian regimes. The reader also needs to keep in mind he is writing his history while World War II is going on, and the need to preserve democracy must feel urgent.

For this reason Russell has little patience for an imagined utopia in which rigid censorship is enforced, reproduction is regulated by the state (which enforces the principles of eugenics), and art is forbidden. Plato's republic looks very much like a totalitarian state. But there is another way to look at Plato's philosophy. Philosopher Gerald A. Press notes that philosophy is an activity for Plato rather than "a set of philosophical doctrines." Plato exhibits "playful seriousness" in his work, and some of what he says can be taken as extreme verbal irony. For example, he says art, which is an imitation, would be banned from his utopia, yet he himself is a practicing imitative poet/artist, which is something that could not have escaped him. Similarly, the philosopher is described as someone who loves truth and apprehends the forms, and yet [Socrates](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Socrates), Plato's mouthpiece in the Republic, never describes the Good and claims to have no knowledge of it. Thus, perhaps Plato should not be taken entirely at his word while reading the Republic.

In discussing Plato's theory of ideas in the _Republic_, Russell does give him credit as a writer. He then summarizes the allegory of the cave, Plato's famous metaphor illustrating his world of form or ideas. Plato's view that the world of forms is real and the actual forms are but the shadow of the real continues the trend in Greek philosophy, going back to Parmenides, which claims that only a metaphysical ideal realm—however it is conceived—is real, while the sensible world is its mere phantom. This is something Russell vigorously disagrees with. He also objects to Plato's discounting of sensory knowledge, which leads to a rejection of science and the body as a "distorting medium." Using his unimpeachable logic, Russell demolishes Plato's notion that people experience only an appearance. An appearance is something and not nothing, he says. Someone might answer that appearance only "appears to appear," but Russell handily answers, "'Does it really appear to appear, or only _apparently_ appear to appear?' Sooner or later, if appearance is even to appear to appear, we must reach something that _really_ appears, and is therefore part of reality." Plato must face up to the implications of multiple appearances of beds in the world, for example, even if only one bed is crafted by God. Any attempt to divide reality into parts, "of which one is more 'real' than the other, is doomed to failure."

In discussing Plato's ideas about knowledge and perception, Russell attempts to demonstrate the bad syntax of Plato's argument with an example. When Russell speaks about bad syntax, he means that the structure in a person's language used to represent reality is illogical and therefore wrong or false. Here is a shortened paraphrase of his example: A parent takes a child to the zoo to prove lions exist. When they get there, the parent may say, "Look, that's a lion." However, if the parent then adds, "And you can see that that exists," the parent would be "uttering nonsense." Thus, a generically existing lion cannot be found in a particular lion, which is what Plato's faulty syntax indicates—that is, he says existence is a property in objects that the mind can apprehend. And since the generic lion does not exist, its existence cannot be apprehended by the mind. What Russell indicates is a particular lion exists and can be apprehended by the senses and understood by the mind.

# Book 1, Part 2, Chapters 19–23 : Ancient Philosophy (Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle) | Summary

## Summary

### Book 1, Part 2, Chapter 19: Aristotle's _Metaphysics_

In [Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/)'s view it took 2,000 years after [Aristotle](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Aristotle)'s death to produce a philosopher who could be regarded as his approximate equal. However, because of his authority, his philosophy also became an obstacle to progress. Aristotle was born in Thrace and studied at [Plato](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Plato)'s Academy for some 20 years. Aristotle was the tutor of the teenaged Alexander (later a world conqueror) for a few years. Then he returned to Athens and founded his school.

Russell characterizes Aristotle as more systematic and professorial than his predecessors and less influenced by the Orphic elements of Greek philosophy, meaning he is not passionate or deeply religious. He criticizes Plato's theory of ideas (ideal forms), saying that if man resembles an ideal man, for example, then there must be a still more ideal man that the ideal man represents, since the ideal man must be based on _something_. Thus he disproves the theory because it necessitates an infinite regression. Aristotle replaces Plato's ideal forms with his own theory of universals or one-of-a-kind things.

Aristotle distinguishes substance (a this) from universal (a such). Substances are proper nouns (used in a broad sense), one-of-a-kind persons or things like France, Napoleon, and the sun. Universals are common nouns, such as _nation_, _ruler_, _star_, or adjectives such as _white_ and _round_, that can be applied to any number of subjects.

He introduces the term _essence_ (a thing's essential nature). A thing is made of matter but relies for its essence on form. For example, the matter in a marble statue is the marble, while the shape created by the sculptor is the form. The way in which the statue has been rendered (its form) determines its essence. Aristotle equates form with both essence and "primary substance."

### Book 1, Part 2, Chapter 20: Aristotle's _Ethics_

Aristotle begins the _Nicomachean Ethics_ by defining the good as happiness, "an activity of the soul." Aristotle's "golden mean" asserts that every virtue has two extremes, which become vices: for example, courage is the mean between cowardice and rashness. But Russell notes this rule of thumb doesn't work for all virtues—for example, truthfulness. The best (most moral) individuals have "proper pride" and do not underestimate themselves. The virtues of a "magnanimous" man are possible only for a man in a high social position. The best happiness is contemplation, which shares in divine life. Not surprisingly, philosophers are the happiest and most godlike of people.

Russell finds Aristotle's book on ethics to be for the most part "self-consistent" and consistent with his metaphysics, which express an "ethical optimism." Aristotle's metaphysics reflect the "scientific importance of final causes" and "the belief that purpose governs the course of development in the universe." However, Aristotle's acceptance of inequality among people is "repugnant" to a modern sensibility. No trace of social benevolence can be found in Aristotle. Russell also accuses him of "emotional poverty" and a tepidness not found in other Greek philosophers, and he ultimately judges the _Ethics_ "in spite of its fame" as lacking in "intrinsic importance."

### Book 1, Part 2, Chapter 21: Aristotle's _Politics_

Russell calls _Politics_ interesting and important, as a source of principles that remain in force until the end of the Middle Ages. For Aristotle the state is of the utmost importance because it is the highest kind of community, aimed at the highest good. The foundation of the state is the family. Several families make a village, and several villages a state, which he equates with "human society, fully developed." The greatest benefactors are the founders of states, since human beings without law become the worst of the animals and law cannot exist without the state. When Aristotle turns to assess types of government, he ends up offering a "qualified defence" of democracy, since he believes most actual governments are bad and among them "democracies tend to be the best."

### Book 1, Part 2, Chapter 22: Aristotle's _Logic_

Aristotle's influence is greatest in the field of logic, says Russell. He retains his authority throughout the Middle Ages as a logician; in the 13th century Christian philosophers also "accorded him supremacy in the field of metaphysics." While his influence in metaphysics waned after the Renaissance, his influence on logic did not. Russell says he could admire Aristotle's remarkable achievements in logic more if they have not had such a stultifying effect on the field of logic, creating 2,000 years of stagnation.

"Aristotle's most important work in logic is the doctrine of the syllogism," a three-part argument with a major and minor premise and a conclusion. The most familiar is: All men are mortal (major); [Socrates](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Socrates) is a man (minor); therefore, Socrates is mortal (conclusion). A variant of this is: All men are mortal; all Greeks are men; therefore, All Greeks are mortal. Russell provides additional types of syllogisms and then lays out his criticism of Aristotle's logic by (1) pointing out the formal defects in the system; (2) explaining how the syllogism is overestimated in its usefulness as a form of deductive argument; and (3) explaining that deduction itself is overestimated as a form of argument.

With regard to the first criticism, he explains how formal errors in the logic created subsequent errors in metaphysics and the theory of knowledge. For example, enough knowledge exists to know that Socrates was mortal (at some point someone saw him dead), but the same cannot be said for the proposition that all men are mortal. This statement is believed according to inductive reasoning, because no one has seen a man live past a certain number of years. In subsequent syllogisms Aristotle blurs distinctions between names and predicates—or particulars (Socrates) and universals (men; Greeks). This resulted in the idea that a class with only one member is the same as that one member, which "made it impossible to have a correct theory of the number _one_, and led to endless bad metaphysics about unity." Russell's second criticism is that "the attempt to give pre-eminence to the syllogism in deduction misled philosophers as to the nature of mathematical reasoning." The third criticism is that, although Aristotle admits the importance of induction, he gives too much prominence to deduction in his theory of knowledge.

Russell also criticizes Aristotle's famous short work called _The Categories_, in which he names 10 (substance, quantity, quality, relation, place, time, position, state, action, and affection). There is no clear idea of what categories are, however, or any principle on which they have been compiled. Aristotle also introduces into philosophy the notion of essence: a thing's "properties which ... cannot change without [that thing] losing its identity." But essence, like substance, is "a transference to metaphysics of what is only a linguistic convenience." Russell categorically asserts Aristotle's doctrines concerning logic are "wholly false, with the exception of the formal theory of the syllogism, which is unimportant."

### Book 1, Part 2, Chapter 23: Aristotle's _Physics_

Russell covers Aristotle's _Physics_ and _On the Heavens_ in this chapter, since both are influential in the history of philosophy and science. Physics is the science of nature, which has to do with growth—for example, it is the nature of an acorn to grow into an oak tree. "The 'nature' of a thing, Aristotle says, is its end," or the goal for its existence. Thus, the word implies teleology—or the end purpose of a thing rather than its cause. While some things exist by nature, others have causes. "Those things are 'natural' which 'by a continuous movement originated from an internal principle, arrive at some completion.'" While such ideas may suit biology, Russell argues they are an obstacle to scientific progress and "a source of much that was bad in ethics."

_On the Heavens_ puts forth the theory that everything "below the moon [is] subject to generation and decay," while everything from the moon upward is indestructible. Aristotle's geocentric cosmos below the moon (sublunary) is composed of the four elements (earth, water, air, and fire). There is also a fifth element of which the stars and planets are composed. Later Nicolaus Copernicus, Johannes Kepler, and Galileo Galilei have to combat both Aristotle and the Bible in establishing the view of the heliocentric view of the solar system.

## Analysis

While Russell has esteem for [Aristotle](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Aristotle), he nevertheless lays the "demerits" in his philosophy at the door of his successors. This is because Aristotle became an unquestioned authority in science and philosophy, and for this reason the faults in his science and philosophy were ignored. Beginning in the 17th century, "every serious intellectual advance ... had to begin with an attack on Aristotelian doctrine," Russell says. The problems with Aristotle's logic are an especial concern of Russell, whose main area of interest in philosophy is logic.

After Russell explains some aspects of Aristotle's metaphysics, he makes short work of it with his logic, pointing out here as he does elsewhere how distinctions made by philosophers are sometimes simply linguistic "truths"—derived from faulty syntax. Syntax refers to the grammatical structure of sentences, but for a logician like Russell, syntax can be used to paper over sloppy thinking. For example, the word _France_ does not actually refer to a thing called "'France' over and above its various parts." France is nothing more than an idea. Like other proper nouns, it is a convenient way of "collecting events into bundles." Various events are associated over time with the notion of a country named France. If a person is referred to as Mr. Smith, to use another example, this is merely "a collective name for a number of occurrences" that have happened to one person over time. In essence Russell accuses Aristotle of transferring grammatical structures ("the structure of sentences composed of a subject and predicate") to the "world-structure." Thus it makes no sense to call France a substance.

Aristotle argues that forms are substantial (he calls them primary substance), although universals are not. If a person makes a sphere out of brass, the form already existed (the sphere), along with the matter (brass), and a person merely brings them together. The sculptor does not make the form (which is substance) in Aristotle's view. This view, in which form and matter exist independently, brings Aristotle back to [Plato](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Plato)'s theory of forms, Russell says, although Aristotle claims to have set this notion aside.

When Russell turns to Aristotle's ethics and politics, he dislikes much of what he finds because the old philosopher is an elitist and Russell is a republican. Plato and Aristotle both assume the highest virtue and greatest good is meant only for the few, but the Stoic philosophers, Christians, and democrats would disagree, says Russell. On Aristotle's page is the philosopher [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Friedrich_Nietzsche), whose "noble man" sounds a lot like Aristotle's "magnanimous man," someone proud who does not underestimate his worth and who doesn't hesitate to despise the unworthy. The magnanimous man is a good man in Aristotle's view, but he is very different from the good man of Christianity, who is humble and tolerant of others. For Aristotle virtues are means to an end—happiness. For the Greeks virtue is solely action that produces the good. On the other hand, "Christian moralists hold that, while the consequences of virtuous actions are in general good, they are not _as_ good as the virtuous actions themselves." While the Greek idea of the good is more in line with modern, secular sensibility, the modern reader cannot help but sympathize with Russell's distaste for many aspects of Greek ethics. For example, Aristotle accepts slavery, the subjection of women and children, and the use of the masses to promote what is good for "magnanimous men" and philosophers. Aristotle's ethics are diametrically opposed to the liberalism of philosopher [John Locke](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#John_Locke) and the principles of modern democracies—that all human beings are created equal and have a right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

Russell finds the most fault with Aristotle's logic, especially because his assumptions went unchallenged for such a long period of time. For philosophers _logic_ is the study of reasoning or the principles for making a valid inference and distinguishing good and bad arguments. Part of the study of logic involves the study of natural language (language developed naturally, for communication), and much of Russell's criticisms of logic are errors in syntax, or the structure of sentences. Language is used primarily in the acquisition of knowledge, which may seem self-evident, but what may not be transparent is that language shapes experience and the way people interpret sensory data. This is why philosophers are so careful about language. This is also why errors in the use of syntax can lead to wrong turns and dead ends when philosophers use language to delve into the meaning of life.

According to the _Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy_, in the 20th century logicians and philosophers came to realize serious limitations in Aristotle's logic, and [Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) and Gottlob Frege were Aristotle's most formidable critics. As result, few modern scholars would argue Aristotle's logic is adequate for understanding science, mathematics, or even everyday reasoning. At the same time, trained logicians of the 21st century have rehabilitated Aristotle, not necessarily for arriving at correct results but rather for sharing certain similarities with his modern counterparts, such as an interest in "metatheory" (theory-making about theory) and an interest in the properties of systems of inference.

### Book 1, Part 2, Chapter 24: Early Greek Mathematics and Astronomy

[Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) notes that the Greeks worked out early mathematical concepts and studied irrational numbers, which leads to a geometrical theory of proportion. Euclid (c. 300 BCE) wrote a textbook of geometry (_Elements_) that is still in use in the modern era. While most of Euclid's textbook is not original, the order of propositions and structure belongs to him. In Russell's view _Elements_ is "one of the most perfect monuments of the Greek intellect."

Aristarchus of Samos first came up with the idea of a heliocentric (sun-centered) solar system and calculated Earth rotates on its axis every 24 hours. Copernicus knew something of Aristarchus's theory when he fashioned his own similar theory centuries later. The Greek picture of the solar system "was not so very far from the truth," says Russell. Nonetheless, the Greek astronomers imagined the planets were fixed together and moved together. The two great mathematicians, Archimedes (c. 287–12 BCE) and Apollonius (c. 240–190 BCE), were the last great men in a great age of philosophy, says Russell. After the Roman conquest the Greeks lost their self-confidence, which belongs to political liberty.

## Analysis

[Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) notes that the Greeks were preeminent in mathematics and astronomy, but in fact the Indians and Chinese had uncovered some of the same principles as the Greeks in other parts of the world. The Hellenistic period is bookmarked by the death of Alexander the Great (323 BCE) and the ascendency of the first Roman emperor Octavian, soon to be called Augustus, who defeated his rivals and became sole ruler of the empire (27 BCE). The Greeks were conquered by the Romans in 146 BCE, and according to Russell, "the Roman soldier who killed Archimedes was a symbol of the death of original thought that Rome caused throughout the Hellenic world." Such a statement on Russell's part seems something of an exaggeration. The Romans rebuilt Greek cities after their conquest and preserved Greek culture. They patronized Greek intellectuals since they were enamored of the Greeks and appropriated much of their culture wholesale. Philosophy continued in the Greek world, although it was more eclectic and diverse than in earlier days.

## Summary

### Book 1, Part 3, Chapter 25: The Hellenistic World

[Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) divides "the Greek-speaking world in antiquity" into three eras: the period of the free city-states, dominion of the Macedonians, and rule under the Roman Empire. He calls the second period the Hellenistic age, in which the Greeks did their best work in science and mathematics.

Alexander the Great, a Macedonian, conquered Asia Minor, Syria, Egypt, Babylonia, Persia, Samarcand (Samarkand), Bactria, and the Punjab. He brought down the Persian Empire and spread Greek culture by encouraging its fusion with the cultures he conquered. Alexander reigned from 334 to 324 BCE, and when he died his empire was divided among the families of three generals. Persia (present-day Iran) was reconquered by the Parthians, and Hellenistic influences brought by Alexander were somewhat overshadowed by the spread of Buddhist culture under the Indian emperor Asoka (also Ashoka). Babylonia (present-day Iraq) and Mesopotamia (some of Iraq plus Kuwait, the eastern parts of Syria, and southeastern Turkey) were strongly influenced by Hellenism until the Islamic conquest in the 7th century CE. The urban areas of Syria were Hellenized, along with Alexandria in Egypt, which became a center of learning for mathematics.

Under Alexander old Greek city-states became "parochial and unimportant." But after Alexander "the Hellenistic world was sinking into chaos, for lack of a despot strong enough to achieve stable supremacy, or a principle powerful enough to produce social cohesion." While the civic spirit of the old cities mostly survived, this period after Alexander and before the Roman conquest is one of confusion and moral decay. Russell quotes C.F. Angus, who says that in the 3rd century BCE, metaphysics took a back seat, and ethics became a matter for individuals. Philosophy was no longer "the pillar of fire" followed by "intrepid seekers" but rather "an ambulance following in the wake of the struggle for existence ... picking up the weak and wounded."

### Book 1, Part 3, Chapter 26: Cynics and Sceptics

The emphasis on "other-worldliness" of the Christian era was related to the "eclipse of the City State," says Russell. After the conquest of Alexander Greek philosophers turned away from politics and focused on "individual virtue or salvation," asking how men can be good in a "wicked world" or happy "in a world of suffering." Four schools of philosophy founded around the time of Alexander's conquest were the Cynics, the Skeptics, the Stoics, and the Epicurians.

The founder of the Cynics was Diogenes, whose teacher Antisthenes was a student of [Socrates](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Socrates). Antisthenes wanted to return to nature and believed everything important can be learned from plain, uneducated men. Diogenes went further, rejecting all conventions and deciding to live like a dog, which is why he is called a Cynic (meaning canine). Diogenes was passionate about virtue and had no use for worldly goods. "He sought virtue and moral freedom in liberation from desire," says Russell. Though a contemporary of [Aristotle](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Aristotle), Diogenes belongs in temperament to the Hellenistic age. "Aristotle is the last Greek philosopher who faces the world cheerfully; after him, all have, in one form or another, a philosophy of retreat," says Russell. The doctrine of Diogenes appealed to weary men who have been disappointed and have lost their zest for life.

Skepticism was a radical continuation of earlier Greek ideas in which the value of perception was called into question by more than one philosopher. Russell calls Skepticism a philosophy of "dogmatic doubt," in which the philosopher claims "nobody knows, and nobody ever can know." Pyrrho (360–270 BCE) was the first Skeptic, and his disciple Timon of Phlius (320–230 BCE) used logic to argue that everything has to be proved "by means of something else," which makes all argument "either circular or an endless chain hanging from nothing." Thus nothing can be proved with certainty. The best one can say is that the "honey appears sweet," for example, which is highly probable but not certain. A contemporary of Timon was Arcesilaus (315–240 BCE), who maintained no tenets of his own but "would refute any thesis set up by a pupil." Because of his influence, [Plato](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Plato)'s Academy remained skeptical for about 200 years. Skepticism continued to have some appeal until the 3rd century CE, even after the Academy turned away from this philosophy (in the first century BCE). Nonetheless, Skepticism is "contrary to the temper of the age, which was turning more and more to dogmatic religion and doctrines of salvation."

## Analysis

[Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) backtracks in Book 1, Part 3, Chapter 25 to talk about the time period before the Roman conquest. His account of history from the time of Alexander the Great's conquest until the domination of the Greeks by Rome is confusing because he refers to the domination of the Macedonians—by which he means both the period of conquest under Alexander and the period following, when his generals carved up Alexander's kingdom. This period is also called the Hellenistic era or Hellenistic age. Russell also seems to contradict himself because he previously said Rome was responsible for Greek culture going into decline, but in this chapter he blames the decline of Greek culture on the splintering of Alexander's kingdom among the generals. He also seems to jump back and forth in time, so he says on the one hand that mathematics and science flourished during the Macedonian period and later says culture was in decline. Perhaps he is thinking about different parts of the period, which is at least 300 years long. Here as well as elsewhere in the text, Russell refers to "barbarians," meaning peoples who are not culturally Greek, Roman, or Christian.

The events of the Hellenistic Era can be summarized as follows: The first period of the free city-states ends with Alexander's conquest in 334 BCE. Alexander rules the Greek world for 10 years, and when he dies in 323 his empire is carved up by his senior officers, with the longest lasting kingdom of Ptolemy flourishing in Egypt and Libya (323 BCE to 30 BCE), according to scholar Anthony Kenny. The last of the Ptolemies, Queen Cleopatra of Egypt, kills herself to avoid becoming the prisoner of Augustus, the first Roman emperor who conquers Egypt in 30 BCE. The other kingdoms of Alexander's generals gradually come under the rule of the Romans. When the Romans battle Carthage the Greeks try to help them, but Carthage is defeated as well as Greece, which is conquered in 146 BCE. Although the Romans destroy Corinth to punish the Greeks, they quickly rebuild the ancient cities, and the Greeks prosper under the Romans who allow them to sail and trade.

Under the Romans Greek civilization around the eastern Mediterranean flourished, says contemporary scholar Anthony Kenny. Greek colonists in Bactria, at the eastern end of the empire, encounter Buddhism because of the missionary efforts of the Indian emperor Asoka. In Persia the Greeks were exposed to Zoroastrianism, whose prophet was Zoroaster (also Zarathustra). In Palestine the Greeks met the Jews. Kenny notes the early Ptolemies built the great library at Alexandria, which was a melting pot of people from all over the Greek world. In Alexandria the Hebrew Bible was translated into Greek by 70 scholars. Anthony Kenny says brilliant mathematicians and scientists in Alexandria competed with the scholars of [Plato](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Plato)'s Academy and the Lyceum, the school founded by [Aristotle](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Aristotle). Meanwhile philosophy was flourishing in Athens as a number of new schools are established.

Russell's lens on this historical period sees the eclipse of the city-state as a reason for philosophers' turning away from civic-mindedness and worldly engagement and focusing on individual enlightenment or salvation. Thus Russell accounts for the four schools of philosophy that ask how men can be good in a wicked world. But perhaps the new trends in philosophy can be partially accounted for by the fact that the Greeks came into closer contact with the religions of India, Persia, and the Middle East during the Hellenistic period and incorporated some of these "pessimistic" ideas from Eastern philosophies into the historically optimistic Greek view. Certainly the ideas of the Cynics and Stoics seem to have more than a little in common with the practices of nonattachment taught in Buddhism and earlier Indian philosophers in which Buddhism has its roots. To say that Cynicism was a philosophy in retreat is a cultural bias on Russell's part. This philosophy can also be seen as a turning inward upon realizing that the charms of the world are temporary satisfactions. For such people the gifts of the internal world may more than make up for what the external world has to offer.

# Book 1, Part 3, Chapters 27–28 : Ancient Philosophy (Ancient Philosophy after Aristotle) | Summary

## Summary

### Book 1, Part 3, Chapter 27: The Epicureans

The Stoics and Epicureans arose in the same time period. Epicurus founded his school in 311 BCE. His philosophical community is poor, and they subsist mainly on bread and water. Epicurus demanded from his followers allegiance to a dogmatic creed, whose purpose is to secure tranquility. For him the greatest good is pleasure, which begins with pleasures of the body, particularly food. But he is far from a hedonist and simply wishes to maintain in the body a state of equilibrium in which there is no pain. Thus the "absence of pain, rather than presence of pleasure" is "the wise man's goal." The wise man lives an obscure life and attempts to avoid enemies. The safest social pleasure is friendship, and he speaks of his community as "our holy body." He dislikes sexual intercourse and considers marriage and children a distraction. [Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) calls Epicureanism "a valetudinarian's philosophy, designed to suit a world in which adventurous happiness had become scarcely possible." Epicurus wishes to dispel fear caused by religion and the dread of death. Thus Epicurus believes the soul is dispersed at death and, while the gods exist, they do not involve themselves in human affairs.

Russell names the Roman poet Lucretius (99–55 BCE) as Epicurus's "only eminent disciple." Like Epicurus, Lucretius hates religion—a response to popular Greek religious beliefs beyond the "official cults of Zeus and his family." Russell says the Christian idea of hell can be traced back to the Greeks, who imagine punishment after death. The rejection of immortality of the soul may seem "gloomy and depressing" to modern readers, but it is a source "of liberation from the burden of fear" for the followers of Epicurus. Epicureanism endures as a philosophy for about 600 years, but people increasingly need "stronger medicine from philosophy or religion," says Russell. "The philosophers took refuge ... in Neoplatonism" and the uneducated in "various Eastern superstitions" and then Christianity.

### Book 1, Part 3, Chapter 28: Stoicism

Zeno, a Phoenician by birth who came to Athens, was the founder of Stoicism in the 3rd century BCE, which is different from later Stoicism espoused by the Romans in the 2nd century BCE. For Zeno only virtue is important. He believed everything was rigidly determined by natural law, and at the conclusion of a cycle the world ends and begins again, repeating what has happened, in a never-ending loop. Nature's course is determined by the Lawgiver or Providence, and everything connected with human beings has a purpose. The Supreme Power is God, or Zeus, who is not separate from the world. Virtue is will, which is agreement with nature, while the wicked who do not agree go along with nature involuntarily. In the Stoic view everything good and bad in a person's life depends on themselves. This does not refer to power over externals; rather, people have freedom to act in accordance with nature as well as to free themselves from worldly desire. Russell points out the logical flaws in the Stoic argument, saying that if virtue is the sole good then Providence must want to cause virtue, yet Nature has produced a lot of bad apples. Further, if the world is predetermined, then whether a person is virtuous or not lies out of their hands. Finally, the belief in an eternal recurrence seems futile, especially when considering all the terrible and painful things that happen in the world.

More important historically were the later Stoics connected with Rome: Seneca (a statesman), Epictetus (a slave), and Marcus Aurelius (an emperor). Seneca did not practice what he preached and amassed a large fortune before he fell out with Emperor Nero and was forced to commit suicide. Marcus Aurelius is famous for his _Meditations_, in which he makes many contradictory statements in espousing a Stoic point of view. Russell provides several quotations from Epictetus, who opines slaves are equal to other men since all are "sons of God." A long passage from Epictetus defines a Stoic as a "man who wishes to be at one with God," free of desire, passions, and aversions. The impersonal sections of the _Meditations_ are in close agreement with Epictetus, Russell says, but he points out additional logical contradictions in Stoic philosophy. In addition to its contributions to ethics, Stoicism adds to philosophy "theory of knowledge [and] the doctrine of natural law and natural rights." Despite [Plato](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Plato), Stoics accepted the validity of perception and acknowledged innate ideas that were "luminously obvious" and the basis for deductions. "This point of view was accepted throughout the Middle Ages, and even by Descartes," says Russell.

## Analysis

Although Epicurus wrote some 300 books, almost all that he wrote is lost, and most of what history knows of him comes secondhand from Lucretius's long Latin poem _On the Nature of Things_, which was likely written some 200 years after Epicurus's death. There are only fragments from the writings of the original Stoics, and what is known about them was written by others. No original writings of the Roman Stoics exist.

While most people associate Epicurus with hedonism or connoisseurship, he was nothing of the sort. Epicurus's primary purpose is to secure tranquility according to [Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/), but other sources indicate he is most concerned with freeing people from the fear of death—or rather, the fear of hell. As Russell notes, people feared damnation, a concept that has roots in Mesopotamian religion and carries over into the Greeks' nonmainstream religious beliefs. The Mesopotamians pictured the afterlife as a house of dust and a sealed fortress, the fate of all who die regardless of their rank or merit. The Greek cult of Dionysus imagines Hades as a place where people are eternally tortured unless they escape through spiritual initiation. The Orphic movement embellishes this picture, adding their own version of divine retribution as well as reincarnation. Through the Classical period (500–323 BCE) and Hellenistic periods (323–30 BCE) the underworld becomes more "infernalized."

The Greeks were exposed to Zoroastrian beliefs as well, which sort the dead for heaven, hell, and a proto-purgatory or limbo according to merit. In fact [Plato](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Plato) discusses three possible destinations for the dead in the _Phaedo_, as Russell has noted earlier. As Russell explains, Epicurus's idea that death is the end of the road for human beings is a comfort for those who fear unending torment in the afterlife. The natural corollary of Epicurus's philosophy is to make the most of time served on Earth. Since Epicurus is a wise philosopher, he knows unbridled hedonism will not net the most happiness, which is why he counsels moderation in all things. His recommendations for living a good life are meant to cultivate contentment rather than chimerical happiness, since contentment is a more realistic goal and makes life pleasant.

The Greek Stoics idolized [Socrates](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Socrates), who seemed to embody their teachings in his indifference to material comfort and calmness in the face of death. The Stoics advocated living in accordance with nature because its laws are divinely designed. Their belief that all things are predetermined yet human beings are free and responsible does seem contradictory, as Russell points out. The key to this paradox may be that the Stoics are free to voluntarily accept the laws of nature—thus there is freedom in resignation. Such an attitude prefigures later existentialism. While the existentialists do not believe in predetermination, and many do not believe in God, they also find comfort in the notion of resignation to the facts of existence as they stand. Like the Stoics, existentialists take responsibility for everything that happens to them, regardless of whether they are "responsible" or not, and believe it is up to them to make their lives count as something good.

# Book 1, Part 3, Chapters 29–30 : Ancient Philosophy (Ancient Philosophy after Aristotle) | Summary

## Summary

### Book 1, Part 3, Chapter 29: The Roman Empire in Relation to Culture

Rome conquered Carthage in Africa and Syracuse in Sicily during the Punic Wars in the 3rd century BCE. In the next century Rome conquered Macedonia and the territory that had been consolidated into Alexander's empire. By the first century CE the territory that today is Egypt, Spain, France, and England were all under Roman rule. The Roman Empire was generally stable and peaceful for more than two centuries, from the accession of Augustus in 30 CE to the turbulent period of the 3rd century CE. Under Augustus the administration of the empire became organized "with some regard to the welfare of the population." From 98 to 180 CE, "the government ... was as good as any despotic government [could] be." The empire could have fallen in the turmoil of the 3rd and 4th centuries, but its ultimate fate is delayed by the emperors Diocletian (r. 286–305) and Constantine (r. 313–37).

Diocletian reined in the army by hiring German barbarians, allowing them to hold the highest commands. By then the empire had been divided into Eastern and Western regions, roughly corresponding to Greek and Latin speakers. Constantine reunited the empire, established Byzantium (later Constantinople) as the capital of the East, and made Christianity legal. When the German barbarians finally overran the Western empire in the 5th century, they adopted Christianity and thus preserved "so much of ancient civilization as had been absorbed by the [Catholic] Church." The Eastern Empire survived until the 15th century, when it was conquered by the Muslim Ottoman Turks. But from the 7th to the 11th centuries, Arabs help preserve Greek culture when Muslims conquered Syria, Egypt, North Africa, and Spain. The Muslims further advanced the study of algebra, reintroduced [Aristotle](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Aristotle) to Europe, and introduced Arabic numerals and chemistry.

Rome's influence on Hellenistic thought was minimal. More important was the considerable influence of Greece and the East on Rome. The Romans learned Greek, copied Greek architecture, merged their gods with those of Greece, adopted their myths and poetic meters, and took over their theories. On the whole Rome is "culturally parasitic on Greece." As culture began to generally decay in the 3rd century, non-Hellenistic religions and superstitions gained some traction in the Roman Empire. By the time Christianity became the state religion in 380, it "had absorbed much from Greece, and transmitted this, along with the Judaic element, to succeeding ages in the West." The West owes to both Alexander and the Roman Empire the idea of a unified government and culture: "We are acquainted with what was done by the Greeks in art and literature and philosophy and science ... [because of] the stability introduced by Western conquerors who had the good sense to admire the civilization which they governed."

### Book 1, Part 3, Chapter 30: Plotinus

Plotinus was the founder of Neoplatonism and "the last of the great philosophers of antiquity." Plotinus was an important influence "in molding the Christianity of the Middle Ages." Born in Egypt, Plotinus studied in Alexandria. He had great respect for [Plato](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Plato) and borrowed and refined some of his ideas. Plotinus's metaphysics were based on a Holy Trinity of the One, Spirit, and Soul. The One is supreme—akin to God, transcending Being, and present in all things. The Spirit, called _nous_, is both spirit and the intellectual principle. _Nous_ is the image of the One, which comes into existence because the One in its self-quest has a vision. "The experience of 'ecstasy' (standing outside one's own body) happened frequently to Plotinus," [Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) notes. The Soul is the lowest and third member of the Trinity, "the author of all living things" and the "offspring of the Divine Intellect." The Soul is associated with downward movement, in which an image is generated—that is, Nature and the world of the senses.

Plotinus did not find the world evil, but rather beautiful. "Matter is created by Soul, and has no independent reality," explains Russell. Soul may have to experience reincarnation if it sins, but as it moves closer to eternal life it remembers less and less of the world, and finally has no memory of personality in "contemplative vision." Russell gives Plotinus kudos for the beauty of his vision and for preserving aspects of Greek intellect and moral devotion, which "made possible the rise of scholastic philosophy." He faults Plotinus for looking inward rather than outward and contributing to the bias of subjectivism over science.

## Analysis

The Romans have the good sense to admire Greek culture and preserve it, so the West can thank the Romans for that as well as their roads, bridges, tunnels, aqueducts, and other architectural structures they built throughout the lands they occupied. The Roman Empire was divided in 285 CE after it became too large to manage by the central government. Emperor Diocletian divided the empire into four sections to be ruled administratively by himself and three other designated Caesars; then Constantine brought the empire back together for a short time. Since Christianity is still in the process of defining dogma, Constantine also pushes bishops to agree on important items of belief. This results in the Council of Nicaea in 325.

Christianity had already made inroads throughout the empire by this time, and even many of the so-called barbarians were already Christian. (The peoples who overrun the Western Roman empire included Huns, Goths, Vandals, Bulgars, Alani, Suebi, and Franks.) Others adopted Christianity after conquest. Thus Christianity was preserved because conquerors adopted it as a religion rather than try to stamp it out, and both the Church and the empire absorbed a lot of Greek civilization by the time Rome succumbed to continued invasions. This is another reason Greek thought did not perish.

When [Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) is writing his history, it is common to call people without membership in the "great" civilizations of the West (Greek, Roman, and Christian) barbarians without thinking about the ethnocentricity such labeling implied. Although Russell uses the term _barbarian_ freely, modern historians rarely do because the term came to have a pejorative meaning and still means someone uncouth, uncivilized, or inhuman. Historians also do not much refer to the Dark Ages but rather refer to the period 476–800 or 400–1000 as the Migration Period or the early Middle Ages. From 476 to 799, there is no emperor in the West, and frequent warfare results in the disappearance of cities. The peoples who overrun the Western Roman empire included Huns, Goths, Vandals, Bulgars, Alani, Suebi, and Franks.

Plotinus's works were edited after his death by his chief disciple Porphyry (233–305) into nine treatises called _Enneads_. Though his school in Rome did not continue after his death, his ideas were disseminated through his disciples. One even founded a Neoplatonic school in Athens. Russell says Plotinus was important in molding the Christianity of the Middle Ages, but in fact he provided a key ingredient to Christian thought that became the backbone of Saint Augustine's theology. This is the belief in God as an incorporeal being. The notion of a corporeal God is widespread among followers of Judaism and Christianity as well as Gnosticism in the first centuries of Christianity. (The Gnostics are Christians who claimed to have access to special, secret knowledge handed down by the apostles of Jesus to a select group.) The Christians of Rome in the 4th century studied Neoplatonic texts, and under the tutoring of Bishop Ambrose and others Saint Augustine learned to reimagine God as an immaterial being outside the realm of time and space rather than as the anthropomorphic, material being often depicted in the stories of the Hebrew Bible.

# Book 2, Part 1, Introduction : Catholic Philosophy (The Fathers) | Summary

## Summary

Catholic philosophy dominated European thought for 10 centuries, beginning with Saint Augustine and ending with the Renaissance. In this period the greatest philosophers sought to perfect "the Catholic synthesis." The Church aligned philosophical belief with social and political life, from around 400 to 1400. The power of the Church derived from the devout belief of Catholics, including the lay (nonclerical) rulers. [Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) says that from the conversion of Constantine to the death of the philosopher Boethius, the thoughts of Christian philosophers were still dominated by the Roman Empire, but after the reign of Pope Saint Gregory the Great (r. 590–604) the separation between clergy and laity (nonclerics) became more pronounced. In this period the lay aristocracy created the feudal system, which is able to contain anarchy. In the 11th century the Church disentangled itself from the feudal system, which "is one of the causes of the emergence of Europe from the dark ages." The first period of Catholic philosophy is dominated by Saint Augustine (354–430) and [Plato](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Plato). The second period ends with [Saint Thomas Aquinas](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Saint_Thomas_Aquinas) (1225–74).

The Catholic synthesis and political domination of the Church unraveled for a number of reasons. First the growth of a rich middle class rivaling the clergy began to assert its own moral authority. Moreover, this class is friendly to democratic tendencies and eventually succeeded in emancipating "economic life from ecclesiastical control." At the end of the Middle Ages strong monarchies in France, England, and Spain allied themselves with the merchants against the aristocracy and became strong enough "to fight the Pope in the national interest." As a result the papacy began to lose moral prestige. Also dealing a blow to the papacy is the move of the popes to Avignon, France (1309–77), and the subsequent Western schism (1378–1417) in which rival popes fought for dominance. By the 15th century the papacy was subordinated to the Italian princes. The Renaissance (beginning in Italy in the 14th century) and the Reformation (c. 1517–1648) completed the disruption of "the medieval synthesis." Russell explains that Part 2 of his volume on Catholic philosophy will trace its growth and decay.

In providing preliminary historical background, Russell describes the Roman Empire in the 3rd century as a "disaster" in which "the general level of well-being was sharply lowered." By the 5th century barbarians established themselves in Western Europe, and the cultivated urbanites of Roman civilization were reduced to poverty or retired to estates. Arabs conquered territory in the Eastern Empire and established themselves in Africa and Spain. Danes and Normans created chaos in France, England, Sicily, and southern Italy. "Life, throughout these centuries, was precarious and full of hardship," says Russell, and most people held "gloomy superstitions." A ruling idea was that "the great majority even of Christians would go to hell," and people's general misery contributed to their religious sentiments, says Russell. People believed "nothing of value was possible in the sublunary world expect steadfast virtue that would lead, in the end, to eternal bliss." Catholic philosophy is the philosophy of an institution, and for this reason Russell must include ecclesiastical and political history relevant to the development of philosophical thought in this period in the pages that follow.

In this introduction to Catholic philosophy, [Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) uses the term _Catholic synthesis_, which is the melding of Greek philosophy and Catholic theology as well as the integration of Catholic and Latin culture and the way in which Catholicism regulated religious, political, and social life. The height of the Catholic synthesis occurred in the high Middle Ages, from the 11th through the 13th centuries. In providing a summary of the philosophy to follow, Russell paints in very broad brushstrokes for the purpose of setting the historical period. Some of his sweeping generalizations can be put aside: for example, his claims that life throughout the Middle Ages was full of hardship and people were gloomy and miserable, having no use for the material world and only looking forward to life after death. Incidentally, he contradicts himself when he says, on the one hand, people thought they were going to hell, but on the other they were looking forward to an afterlife of eternal bliss. Given Russell's insistence that others use precise language and stick to the facts, he is especially at fault for pretending to know what all medieval people were thinking and feeling throughout a historical period spanning several hundred years.

The important points Russell makes in thumbnail are the following:

- The Church held tremendous power during this period—even power over kings and emperors.
- The power of the Church was based on devout religious beliefs and allegiance to one religious vision.
- As time passes the laity (the nonclerics) and the clergy or ecclesiastics (priests, bishops, cardinals, pope) became more divided, and as a middle class developed among the laity, they aligned themselves with the highest secular powers against the monolithic power of the papacy (the pope and his cardinals and bishops). This led to more sharing of power and a movement toward democracy.
- Absolute power of the Church led to increasing corruption within the organization. This corruption seeded the Church's downfall as a political, religious, and philosophical powerhouse.
- Other factors that dissolved the Catholic synthesis were the Scientific Revolution and the Protestant Reformation.

## Summary

### Book 2, Part 1, Chapter 1: The Religious Development of the Jews

The Christian religion at the time of the late Roman Empire consisted of three elements: philosophical beliefs derived from [Plato](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Plato), the Neoplatonists, and Stoics; ideas about morals and history derived from the Jews; and salvation theories partly traceable to Greek Orphism and similar Near East cults. These elements from Judaism were imported into Christianity: (1) sacred history "justifying the ways of God to man"; (2) the idea of an "elect" chosen by God; (3) ideas about righteousness, particularly almsgiving; (4) the Law, written in sacred texts; (5) the Messiah; and the Kingdom of Heaven. Both Jews and early Christians conceived of the "Other World" as material.

Historians must depend on the Old Testament (or "Hebrew Bible") for the early history of the Israelites. The Assyrians conquered the northern kingdom of Israel in 722 BCE and removed most of the population, but the kingdom of Judah preserved the Israelite religion and tradition. In 586 BCE Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem, enslaving most of the population and bringing them back to Babylon. In 538 BCE Babylon fell and the Jews returned to Judea (Judah) and established orthodoxy. In the period of captivity they conceived of Yahweh as a jealous god. Fiercely nationalistic prophets of Jewish religion taught that other gods and religions are false: the Jews are chosen by God, and he will punish them for their wickedness. In this way they accounted for their sufferings.

The Jews were again disrupted in 175 BCE when King Antiochus IV tried to Hellenize them. A successful revolt against Antiochus was led by Judas Maccabaeus, who then negotiated with Rome and won Jewish autonomy for a time. Since the Jews living outside their homeland had become acculturated, the religion was saved by the Maccabees (followers of Maccabaeus). Judaism later became the seedbed for Christianity. Eventually Judea was put under the charge of a Roman procurator. In 66 the Jewish Zealots rebelled against Rome, and in punishment the Romans destroyed the Jewish Temple. For the most part the Jews were dispersed from their homeland. Because the Alexandrian Jews could not read Hebrew, the Old Testament was translated into Greek and called the Septuagint. Christians relied on this somewhat defective translation until Saint Jerome produced a Latin Bible, which became the authoritative Catholic text. After the diaspora (dispersion) the Jews established colonies all over the ancient world. As Christianity took shape, it grew hostile toward Judaism. Throughout the Middle Ages the Jews were persecuted in Christian countries. Only among the Muslims in Europe are "Jews ... treated humanely ... and ... able to pursue philosophy and enlightened speculation."

### Book 2, Part 1, Chapter 2: Christianity during the First Four Centuries

Christianity began as a reformed Judaism, as taught by Jesus's disciples James and Peter, but Saint Paul insisted on converting Gentiles (non-Jews) without subjecting them to such customs as circumcision and the food rules prescribed by Jewish law. Since Paul's view won, Christianity spread. The Gnostics mixed new Christian ideas with old Greek concepts; [Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) calls Gnosticism "a half-way house between philosophic paganism and Christianity." Manichaeism and other forms of Gnosticism flourished until Christianity became the official government religion. The Christian view of the Jews is that God had spoken to the prophets and foretold Christ's coming, but the Jews refused to recognize him. Further, Jesus has replaced Mosaic Law with his salvific death and new commandments. Thus when Christianity became a state religion, anti-Semitism began to flourish.

As Christianity became Hellenized, it became more theologically complicated, says Russell. The simplicity of Jewish theology can be seen in the synoptic Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. The Gospel of Saint John, however, has a Greek flavor, identifying Jesus with the Logos of Platonic and Stoic thinking. The Church fathers followed Saint John's lead and referenced his Gospel more than the others. Origen was the first serious synthesizer of Greek philosophy and Hebrew scripture. He identified God as wholly incorporeal. In his view all people will ultimately become bodiless when they submit to Christ, and even the devil will be saved in the end. In later times the Church called Origen a heretic because of some of his beliefs.

Church government developed during the first three centuries after Christ. In the early centuries certain doctrinal quarrels arose—for example, whether Jesus was a divine being. To settle this dispute Constantine convened an ecumenical council, which drew up the first version of the Nicene Creed enumerating the tenets of Christian faith. Russell discusses possible motives for Constantine's conversion to Christianity, relying heavily on Gibbon's analysis in _The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_. Constantine obtains an "organized bloc" of support by converting. Moreover, a large part of Constantine's army is Christian already.

## Analysis

In the first chapter on Catholic philosophy, [Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) provides background on the sources of Christianity, in Greek philosophy, Judaism, and the religions of the Near East. As already noted, concepts of heaven, hell, and purgatory can be found in Mesopotamian religion, which make their way into Greek Orphism. From Stoic philosophy came the idea of resigning oneself to the will of God. While Russell notes the Jews conceived of the "Other World" as material, as did the early Christians, Neoplatonism later added to Christianity a coherent explanation of a transcendent God. Neoplatonism also had a concept of a divine Trinity, perhaps prefiguring the three persons of the Christian God. From Judaism came shared history, beginning with the Creation story found in the Hebrew Bible.

Russell says the Christian idea of the elect of God, chosen for heaven, can be traced back to the Jewish idea that they are chosen by God, but perhaps the Christians followed the Jews more so in their insistence that all other notions of God except their own are false. Russell also claims the Jews preceded the Christians in coming up with the idea that the virtuous are rewarded in the afterlife and the wicked tormented. This occurs after Jewish persecution by Antiochus IV recorded in the First Book of Maccabees. While Judaism generally does not put a lot of emphasis on the afterlife, especially in the modern period, the idea that the wicked will be punished after death does appear in Jewish scripture.

Russell mentions the Jewish Dispersion in passing. The first diaspora (dispersal) of the Jews occurred when many were taken into captivity by the Babylonians. A large number of Jews fled to Egypt at that time and formed a large community there. After the Jews were freed by Cyrus the Great in 538 BCE, some stayed behind. Despite the Exodus story, there is no credible historical evidence that the Jews were ever in captivity in Egypt or that a leader named Moses defeated the pharaoh of Egypt and led his people through the desert. No doubt this is why Russell leaves Moses out of his history. The second great diaspora of the Jewish people occurs when Romans forced the Jews out of their homeland beginning in 70 CE because of their repeated rebellion against their conquerors, who first arrived in 63 BCE.

In providing a thumbnail sketch of the early years of Christianity, Russell mentions the Christian mystic Origen, who is the first to introduce into the Christian tradition the idea of an incorporeal God. In fact Origen had the same teacher as Plotinus, as Russell notes. Both men lived in Alexandria, Egypt, and studied with Ammonius Saccas, whom some historians identify as the true founder of Neoplatonism. Plotinus and his disciple Porphyry were later read by Bishop Ambrose and the Christian community in Rome, which introduced Saint Augustine to the same ideas. The incorporeal God entered Western Christianity more directly as a result of Augustine's teachings rather than Origen's. Although Origen is not given much space in Russell's survey of Catholic philosophy, he is the first systematic theologian and philosopher of Christianity.

Russell mentions the Gnostics in his survey but follows the general Christian bias of excluding them as Christians. In fact many Gnostics considered themselves to be Christians with alternative views. Scriptures of the Gnostic Christians found buried in Nag Hammadi, Egypt, in 1945 reveal some of their beliefs, excluded and suppressed as mainstream doctrine hardened and the leaders of the new religion regularized the dogma that would become the orthodox teaching of the Church. Russell also has a habit of referring to the Arian Christians as Arians throughout his treatise. The Arians were most certainly Christians, but they believed that God did not share his godhead with Jesus, contrary to what became orthodox belief—that Jesus is equal to God as one of the three persons of God. The Council of Nicaea, called by Constantine in 325 CE to settle this dispute, was the first of many counsels convened through the centuries to determine what Christians would believe. Eventually the Church breaks into Eastern and Western divisions, partially over the East's refusal to accept the authority of the pope. Russell does not distinguish between the first and second Church schisms, nor does he adequately explain the issues at stake.

# Book 2, Part 1, Chapters 3–4 : Catholic Philosophy (The Fathers) | Summary

## Summary

### Book 2, Part 1, Chapter 3: Three Doctors of the Church

[Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) names four men as Doctors of the Western church: Saint Ambrose, Saint Jerome, Saint Augustine, and Pope Saint Gregory the Great. But their correct title is the four "Latin Fathers of the Church." The first three were contemporaries in the period "between the victory of the Catholic Church in the Roman Empire and the barbarian invasion." These men "fixed the mold into which the Church was shaped." Ambrose created a model for Church-state relations; Jerome produced the Latin Bible and promoted monasticism; and Augustine created the theology of the Church until the Reformation. In this period the Church was "vigorous ... guided by men prepared to sacrifice everything personal in its interests" with "far-sighted" policies that kept the Church in power for many centuries.

Ambrose renounced a successful government career and became bishop of Milan "by popular acclaim" at the end of the 4th century. His duties required him to speak often with Rome's emperors, whom he approached as an equal. He was successful in establishing that the state must yield to the Church in matters of religion, a principle that has retained its importance until the present day, says Russell. In one case Ambrose supported a bishop who destroyed a synagogue, "an example of the manner in which, as soon as it acquired power, the Church began to stimulate anti-Semitism."

Jerome is known for his production of the Vulgate or Latin Bible, accepting help from Jewish rabbis for his translations of the Old Testament from the original Jewish texts. Jerome was born five years after Ambrose, studied in Rome, and spent time as a hermit in Syria. He was a querulous man, even quarreling with the pope and moving to Bethlehem in 386, where he remained until his death.

Russell provides a very short summary of Augustine's life based on the saint's _Confessions_, saying he is primarily concerned with sin, both before and after his conversion to Catholicism.

### Book 2, Part 1, Chapter 4: Saint Augustine's Philosophy and Theology

Bertrand Russell references _The Confessions_ to highlight Augustine's "purely philosophical work." The most interesting part of _Confessions_ is Book 11, which discusses time and God's relation to creation. Augustine sees time as always present—the subjective experience of a created being in the now. Thus to speak about time before creation makes no sense. While Russell does not agree that time is a mental construct, he finds Augustine's theory plausible and a great advance over anything found in Greek philosophy. It is also a clearer statement than Kant's subjective theory of time. Russell moves on to _The City of God_, which was in part an answer to the charge that Rome was sacked by the Goths because the pagans had abandoned their ancient gods. Russell says that the "broad conception" of the book is to contrast the city of the world with the city of God. He finds this book important for establishing these viewpoints: (1) the state must submit to the Church in religious matters; (2) people are predestined for heaven or hell, although they must be baptized to obtain salvation; and (3) Christianity champions the oppressed and downtrodden.

Russell spends the last part of his summary of Augustine on the Pelagian controversy. Pelagius, whom Russell claims is Welsh (although other sources say he is Irish), believed in free will but doubted original sin and thought people are virtuous by their own effort, for which they would be rewarded in heaven. Such views became heretical, largely through Augustine's efforts. Russell represents Augustine's "ferocious doctrine—which was revived by Calvin" as one in which God chooses certain people among the baptized for heaven. All people are depraved, although God bestows grace on the elect; damnation proves God's justice and salvation his mercy. Russell traces this doctrine back to Saint Paul's Epistle to the Romans, which Augustine, with the skill of a lawyer, uses to support his own view. Augustine's "gloomy sense of universal guilt" is the basis of what is harshest in the medieval Church, says Russell. He faults Augustine, Jerome, and Ambrose for being less concerned with saving civilization from the barbarians and more concerned with such issues as virginity (in Saint Jerome's case) and damnation of unbaptized infants (Augustine): "Seeing that these were the preoccupations that the Church handed on to the converted barbarians, it is no wonder that the succeeding age surpassed almost all other fully historical periods in cruelty and superstition."

## Analysis

[Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) names four Doctors of the Church, but even in Russell's time there were more than four. The four he names—Ambrose, Jerome, Augustine, and Pope Gregory the Great—are the four Latin Fathers of the Church (that is, the Fathers of the Church who lived or worked in the western part of the Roman Empire). Russell explains why the Church is so vigorous in the early centuries—guided by men who themselves are guided by a compelling religious vision that is difficult for most people in modern secular culture to imagine. The early Catholic leaders wholeheartedly and devoutly believed and were prepared to sacrifice everything for their faith. Similarly, the people who followed them lived and breathed this shared vision and worldview.

The Latin Bible (the Vulgate) of Jerome replaced the less accurate Latin-based translations of the Bible—both the Old Testament (also called the Hebrew Bible and originally written in Hebrew with a few passages in Aramaic) and the New Testament (originally written in common Greek). Prior to Jerome, Latin translations of the Old Testament were based on the Greek translation from Hebrew, called the Septuagint, but Jerome went back to the original material. Bertrand Russell says the Vulgate, which has since been revised, is the official Bible of the Catholic Church. Currently the Catholic Church claims no official Bible, although the Vulgate continues to get special recognition from the Church.

While Russell tries for even-handedness in outlining the writings of Saint Augustine, he can't help but be swayed by his own indignation as a humanistic agnostic to Augustine's more "ferocious" teachings. The Augustine who writes _The Confessions_, however, is not the same Augustine who writes _The City of God_. Augustine became more rigid and uncompromising as time went on because he felt called upon to stamp out unorthodoxies that threatened the early Church. Augustine particularly fought Pelagianism, which taught that people do not need God's grace to be good. Such a belief clearly threatened the central role of the Church as mediator between God and man. But the Augustine of _The Confessions_ is not a Gloomy Gus, as Russell would have it, suffering under the weight of guilt about sin. Furthermore, in the _Confessions_ Augustine argues people need the grace of God for salvation, but never that only a certain number of people are destined to be saved ahead of time.

Perhaps it would have been fairer of Russell to explain that Augustine held different views of salvation in different parts of his life. Further, it can be argued that _The Confessions_ had much more of an impact on Western Christianity than did _The City of God_, particularly as a model for an individual's relationship with God. _The Confessions_ also has great literary value, which Russell fails to notice, although he gives [Plato](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Plato) kudos for style even if he doesn't like his philosophy either. Granted, Russell is angry about draconian Christianity that promotes feelings of sin and guilt and terror of hell, but it seems hardly fair to lay so much of the blame on Augustine. Certainly some of the blame should be shared with those who came up with the idea of hell in the first place, as well as with those who focused on certain aspects of Augustine that support an extreme view.

# Book 2, Part 1, Chapters 5–6 : Catholic Philosophy (The Fathers) | Summary

## Summary

### Book 2, Part 1, Chapter 5: The Fifth and Sixth Centuries

In the fifth century the barbarians overran the Western empire. The English invaded Britain, which became England; the Franks invaded Gaul, which became France; the Vandals invaded Spain; and Saint Patrick converted the Irish. "Rough Germanic kingdoms" replaced the central government. The mail stopped, the roads decayed, war put an end to commerce, and life was lived once again locally, both politically and economically.

The subject of the Incarnation (God becoming man) became a serious point of theological contention during this period. The dispute involved whether Jesus is two persons—one human and one divine—or two natures (human and divine) in one person. [Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) then relates how Saint Cyril, a fanatical advocate of unity, incited pogroms against the Jews in Alexandria and is behind the horrific death of female Neoplatonic philosopher and mathematician Hypatia. Due to Cyril's tactics at an ecumenical council called to decide the issue of the Incarnation, his party's theory wins the day.

At the beginning of the 6th century Theodoric, an Arian and Ostrogothic barbarian, conquered Italy and restored peace for more than three decades. (An Arian is an unorthodox Christian who denies that Jesus is equal in divinity to God the Father or first person of God.) Four men important in the history of Catholic culture in this century are Boethius, Justinian, Benedict, and Gregory the Great. Boethius, Theodoric's minister and a senator, was accused of plotting against the king and sentenced to death. While in prison Boethius wrote his famous _Consolation of Philosophy_. Russell calls this text, written by someone the Church considers a devout Christian, "purely Platonic." Russell admires the _Consolation_, noting that it contains "no trace of the superstition or morbidness of the age, no obsession with sin, no excessive straining after the unattainable." After Boethius's death Justinian (r. 527–65) became emperor of the East and closed the schools of philosophy in Athens. He attempted to reconquer the Western empire, and a long war ensued with terrible consequences for Italy and Rome. In 568, three years after Justinian's death, the Lombards invaded Italy and fought an intermittent war with the Byzantines for 200 years. "It was this period that ruined Italian civilization," Russell says.

### Book 2, Part 1, Chapter 6: Saint Benedict and Gregory the Great

During the period of incessant war the Church "preserved whatever survived of the culture of ancient Rome." Despite prevailing "fanaticism and superstition ... ecclesiastical institutions created a solid framework, within which, in later times, a revival of learning and civilized arts became possible." Important Church activities in this century are the rise of monasticism and the conversion of the barbarians. Gregory the Great played an important role in strengthening the papacy.

Monasticism began in Egypt and Syria in the 4th century, with both solitary hermits and monastic communities. Saint Anthony is the first of the hermits, who left solitude in 305 to preach and promote his way of life. Russell mentions some of the extremes of asceticism practiced by monastics, such as living on a pillar. Nuns came into existence as early as the 3rd century, and some shut themselves up in tombs, according to Russell. The chief figure in Western monasticism was Saint Benedict, the founder of the Benedictine order and rule. In a sardonic tone using verbal irony Russell relates several miraculous events in the life of Benedict, as told by Pope Gregory the Great. He remarks on the difference between Gregory's "childish and credulous" religious accounts and his mastery as a statesman.

Gregory, born into a rich and noble family, embraced religious life in his 30s. He was tapped by the pope to go to the emperor's court in Constantinople as a diplomat. Then he was abbot of a monastery, and finally he was made pope himself. Gregory was a force against anarchy during turbulent times, writing to bishops and secular rulers. He wrote the _Book of Pastoral Rule_, advice to bishops that remained authoritative through the early Middle Ages. During this period the Goths convert from Arianism to Catholicism, and the Visigoths also adopt Catholicism. Gregory is much involved in the English conversion. Russell does not consider Justinian, Benedict, nor Gregory great men but gives them credit for having much more influence on future ages than the great men of prior times. "Roman law, monasticism, and the papacy owe their long and profound influence very largely to Justinian, Benedict, and Gregory," he says.

## Analysis

The Incarnation controversy refers to an argument within the Church over the nature of Jesus's godhead. According to Catholic doctrine, Jesus is God but is born as man, in the normal fashion, although his mother remains a virgin who conceives through the Holy Spirit or third person of God. In the 5th century, however, Saint Cyril, the patriarch of Alexandria, and Nestorius, the patriarch of Constantinople, disagreed about the exact nature of Jesus's godhead, and this led to terrible consequences for both the Jews and the philosopher Hypatia who got caught in the crossfire. Despite the excesses of fanatics the Church preserves culture through a period of continual warfare.

Once the Western part of the Roman Empire began to suffer waves of invasion, the locus of political power remained in the East. The Ostrogoths were Germanic Goths who originated in the area around the Black Sea. Justinian attempted to get back the Western empire from the Ostrogoth Theodoric, who had originally been backed by the Byzantines in his fight against Odoacer. [Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) notes the Lombards who invaded Italy fight the Byzantines. This is because parts of Italy remained under control of the Eastern Empire after the fall of Rome. Another Germanic people, the Lombards conquered all the main cities of northern Italy and occupied areas in central and southern Italy. They remained in power until the ascendency of Charlemagne at the beginning of the 8th century.

In Book 2, Part 1, Chapter 6 Russell notes some extremes of ascetic practice among the monastics, saying nuns shut themselves up in tombs. Russell is likely referring to anchorites, who are both male and female. Anchorites generally did not belong to a religious order before choosing their vocation. They were permanently enclosed or "walled in," often in an enclosure attached to a church. The quarters of these recluses had one window that looked into the church and one that opened onto the outside world, and people visited and spoke with them through the window. Some anchorite cells had several rooms, and some included a garden. An anchorite also had a servant to bring food and remove waste. Such people must have had enough money to support their enclosure, and they also received alms (charitable contributions). Anchorites spent most of their time in prayer and meditation.

# Book 2, Part 2, Chapters 7–9 : Catholic Philosophy (The Schoolmen) | Summary

## Summary

### Book 2, Part 2, Chapter 7: The Papacy in the Dark Ages

After the barbarian Lombards defeated the Eastern Byzantines who held territory in northern Italy, the papacy necessarily allied itself with the Franks to fight this immediate threat. This move also frees the West from the Greek/Eastern emperors. The Franks were barbarian invaders who, beginning at the end of the 5th century, dominated what is today northern France, Belgium, and western Germany. Pope Gregory III first turned to the Franks in 739 when the Lombards tried to take Rome. In 732 Charles Martel, a powerful Frankish statesman, defeated the invading (Muslim) Moors at the Battle of Tours in France. Martel is the "Mayor of the Palace." The Mayors of the Place are the true power brokers behind the Frankish throne. The Frankish ruler Charlemagne (a convert to Catholicism) defeated the Lombards for good in 774. He conquered both Italy and Germany and became emperor of a somewhat revived Western empire through the machinations of his father and the Mayor of the Palace, Pepin. Charlemagne is crowned with the Church's blessing by Poe Leo III in 800. Thus the "Holy Roman Empire" comes into existence, which under Charlemagne's rule ranges over central Europe and parts of Western Europe, and in Italy as far as Rome.

The pope and emperor have uneasy interdependence, since "no one could be emperor unless crowned by the Pope in Rome; on the other hand ... every strong emperor claimed the right to appoint or depose popes." The Catholic power structure continued to gain ground, even if it experienced setbacks. Germany was converted largely due to the missionary efforts of Saint Boniface, who founded many monasteries. After the death of Charlemagne Western Europe again fell into disarray. Pope Nicholas I (r. 858–67) initially increased papal power, which is subsequently lost when a local Roman ruling family gained the power to appoint their own family members as popes. Meanwhile bishops in the provinces became "assimilated to lay feudal magnates." [Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) marks the year 1000 as "the lowest depth to which the civilization of Western Europe sank." Barbarians came in successive waves, and though Christianized, "weakened the civilized tradition." Muslims conquered areas of Western Europe, and local kings lost control of their feudal lords. Russell comments that although the Dark Ages (600–1000) are dark for Europeans, in other parts of the world civilization is flourishing—particularly in China and Japan, while Islamic culture blossomed from India to Spain. He notes that most of Western civilization comes from "the Eastern Mediterranean, from Greeks and Jews." The West's superiority since the Renaissance is due mostly to scientific and political advances, but there is no reason to think this superiority will continue, he says.

### Book 2, Part 2, Chapter 8: John the Scot

Russell devotes one chapter to John the Scot, also known as Johannes Scotus Erigena, an Irish Neoplatonist. Russell explains how in the chaotic period of the early Middle Ages, the Irish become the guardians of Western culture, preserving in their monasteries knowledge of Greek and Latin brought by European cultural refugees. Later, when Ireland is under siege by the Scandinavians, Irish scholars fled back to the continent. John, possibly one of these refugees, was patronized by the French king and Holy Roman emperor, Charles the Bald. John supported the Pelagian view of free will, which held that people can reach salvation through their own good deeds. He contended that truth can be found in both reason and revelation, but when they are in contention reason is to be preferred. John translated an important Neoplatonic work by Pseudo-Dionysius, which "had a great influence on Catholic philosophy in the West." He also wrote his own great work, _On the Division of Nature_, and came up with the idea that God is "incomprehensible to Himself and to every intellect," although he can be seen in the being of things. He also said that God creates out of nothing, which is to say out of himself, and thus God transcends all knowledge. Sin is the result of freedom, and evil has no ground in God—rather evil is the absence of good. John calls the Logos "the principle that brings the many back to the One ... By union with God, the part of man that effects union becomes divine." Russell finds John's pantheism, "which refuses substantial reality to creatures," (as well as many other of his ideas) contrary to Christian orthodoxy. Russell is amazed to find such an independent thinker in the 9th century.

### Book 2, Part 2, Chapter 9: Ecclesiastical Reform in the Eleventh Century

The Dark Ages began to see a light in the 11th century. The worst of the barbarians were expelled, and the rest settled down to Christian culture. Reformers sought to improve the clergy as well as further separate them from the laity. The doctrine of transubstantiation further elevated the priesthood when it becomes "an article of faith, though it had been generally believed for a long time." During the sacrament (rite or ceremony) of the Eucharist performed by a priest, the faithful believe that bread and wine are turned into the body and blood of Christ. The Church also now wished to impose celibacy on priests, mostly so they could not pass Church property to their sons. At the same time reformers believed celibacy is a higher state than marriage and that celibacy will further separate priests from the laity.

Since the monasteries had become both rich and lax, they too were the targets of reform measures. The source of Church wealth came from the offerings of the laity as well as from simony—or the selling of ecclesiastical privileges, benefits, or offices. For example, the king could sell the office of bishop, and the bishop in turn could sell the office of priest. Even the office of pope was sometimes sold. Simony was a widespread practice and a big concern of reformers.

Pope Gregory VII (r. 1073–85) was the first pope to attempt to strictly enforce clerical celibacy. He also battled "investitures," which is when a newly consecrated bishop is invested with a ring and staff from the king or emperor, symbolizing his position as a vassal to secular power. Gregory wanted those symbols bestowed by the pope. With regard to philosophy Russell gives most attention to Saint Anselm, an Italian monk who developed an "ontological argument" for the existence of God: since God is the greatest possible object of thought, he must exist; otherwise a still greater object would be possible—which is not possible. Some philosophers revived some version of this argument in subsequent centuries, which is reason enough to give this idea serious consideration, says Russell.

## Analysis

When [Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) refers to the papacy, he means the pope and his office—and all the power than went with it. In this period the papacy struggled with various people at different times: the Greek or Byzantine emperor and sometimes with the Western emperor or the Roman aristocracy. The papacy also struggled with the Greek (Byzantine/Eastern) church, led by the patriarchs in Constantinople and allied with the Eastern emperor. Even though they submitted to papal authority, the patriarchs resented being managed "by Rome." The Eastern churches broke away from the Catholic Church in 1054 and formed the various Orthodox churches. This break is called the East-West Schism.

Russell marks 600–1000 CE as the Dark Ages, although this period is now referred to by some as the Migration period or the Early Middle Ages. The early medieval period generally covers 476–800 CE in Western Europe, or more generally 500–1000 CE, during the period of continual warfare. During this period the so-called barbarian peoples moved into what had been the Western Roman Empire. The Western Empire got a temporary reprieve from the fighting when Charlemagne was named the first "Holy Roman Emperor" in 800 through the machinations of his father Pepin, who struck a devil's bargain with the pope. For his son to be considered a legitimate ruler of the Western empire, he needed to be crowned and approved by the pope, although he was in fact not a legitimate Frankish heir to the crown (being only the son of Pepin and not a true descendent of the Frankish Merovingian kings).

On his part the pope needed to be freed from the domination of the Eastern emperor. To establish a papal monarchy in the West, he needed land. Thus the pope and the emperor cooked up a false document—the Donation of Constantine—purportedly signed by the first Eastern emperor and bequeathing old Rome and its western territories to the pope. Russell explains that this illegal gift from Pepin is taken on face value and gave the pope jurisdiction over these lands through the Middle Ages. This is the first in a long line of abuses of papal power that follow. With the bogus gift Charlemagne became emperor of a newly revived Western empire. In the 10th century one corrupt family took over the papacy, and in the northern provinces feudal rulers controlled bishops, Russell says.

By the 11th century Europe is ready for reform. Russell notes the Church addressed the laxity that had crept into the monasteries and is somewhat successful in stopping simony. Although priests and other clergy had been allowed to marry until then, Pope Gregory VII worked to standardize celibacy among the clergy, according to Russell. But in 1123 the First Lateran Council, held under the reign of Pope Calixtus II, officially forbade Catholic clergy to marry or have concubines and also outlawed other abuses, such as the sale of ecclesiastical offices. Thus the Church reforms begun in the 11th century carried over into the 12th century.

## Summary

### Book 2, Part 2, Chapter 10: Mohammedan Culture and Philosophy

The main attacks on the Eastern Empire came from Muslims. After Mohammed's death in 632, his Arab followers began a rapid conquest of Arabia, Syria, Persia, and parts of India, Carthage, and most of Spain, and they besieged Constantinople twice. The Muslim imperialists killed rivals among themselves and took large numbers of slaves. However, they didn't force people to convert (only to pay a special tax) and maintained the roads of previous conquerors to carry on extensive commerce.

Eventually Muslim rule was fractured, with various parts of the empire remaining somewhat independent and distinctive cultures flourishing in the extreme east (Spain) and west (Persia). The Arabs first learned Greek philosophy from the Syrians, who preferred [Aristotle](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Aristotle) to [Plato](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Plato). From the Indians the Muslims learned astronomy and the "Arabic" numerals. The Persians contributed poetry and mysticism to Islam, the latter in the form of Sufism, a Neoplatonic and allegorical interpretation of orthodox Muslim dogma.

Two important Islamic philosophers cited by Russell are Avicenna and Averroes. Avicenna was learned in both medicine and philosophy and wrote an encyclopedia that became influential in the West in Latin translation. His philosophy was more Aristotelian than Neoplatonic, and he "invented a formula ... [that] 'thought brings about the generality in forms.'" For example, the idea of a cat exists before cats, and then the idea of a cat (felinity) exists in actual cats. Averroes sought to improve the Arabic interpretation of Aristotle and claimed existence of God can be proven by reason, a position also taken by [Saint Thomas Aquinas](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Saint_Thomas_Aquinas). Averroes followed Aristotle in believing the soul is mortal but the intellect (nous)—impersonal and the same in all persons—is immortal. Russell sums up by saying Arabic philosophy is for the most part derivative, although the Muslims showed some originality in mathematics, chemistry, and the arts. The Muslims stimulated Western thought, however, especially when Muslim philosophers who followed Aristotle and were persecuted in their homelands took refuge with Jewish communities in the West. Since the Jews knew both Arabic and Western languages, they were able to translate both Muslim philosophers and works of Aristotle already translated into Arabic.

### Book 2, Part 2, Chapter 11: The Twelfth Century

Four aspects of the 12th century are discussed in this chapter: (1) the continued conflict between the papacy and the secular state; (2) the rise of the Lombard cities; (3) the Crusades; and (4) the growth of Scholasticism. The papacy finally forced the emperors to give up their role in the investitures of bishops along with control over their election. Russell provides many details of the quarrels between Emperor Frederick Barbarossa (r. 1152–90) and the Lombard cities in northern Italy. The cities were often allied with the pope against the emperor, who on his side enlisted his own alternative pope. "The rise of free cities is what proved of most ultimate importance in this long strife," says Russell.

The Crusades are initiated by the papacy to increase the power of the Church, Russell says, although their ostensible reason was religious (to reclaim the "Holy Lands" from the Muslims). An important side effect locally was the massacre of large numbers of Jews—in Germany at the time of the first Crusade, and in England during the third Crusade. In this period Jews were also forced to convert and lose property. The Crusades also increased "literary intercourse" between East and West, and many Greek works were translated into Latin.

Scholasticism began in the 12th century, and Aristotle became increasingly known and "accepted as the supreme authority," pushing Plato out of his first place. Although scholars are bound by the limits of dogma, there begins a "vigorous exercise of reason." The most distinguished man among the early Scholastics was Abélard (1079–1142), an exceptional teacher and a quarrelsome philosopher who got into trouble with the authorities on more than one occasion. Abélard said the "dialectic [arguing opposing positions] is the sole road to truth," challenging people's prejudices. His wheelhouse was linguistic critical analysis, and he argued that philosophy doesn't explain things in the world but rather predicates words as meanings. Saint Bernard, a Cistercian monk, was the opposite of Abélard, seeking religious truth in prayer. He was most successful in Church politics, combating heresy, supporting the Crusades, enforcing orthodoxy, and increasing "the power of the pope in secular affairs."

### Book 2, Part 2, Chapter 12: The Thirteenth Century

The 13th century marked a synthesis in Catholic thought. It was an era of great achievement (Gothic cathedrals, chivalric literature, the beginnings of constitutional government) as well as religious excess. Pope Innocent III (r. 1198–1216) "was the first great Pope in whom there was no element of sanctity," says [Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/). "The power motive, from his time on, more and more exclusively dominated the papacy, and produced opposition from some religious men even in his day." Innocent persecuted a heretical sect in France known as the Albigenses. Their "cult of poverty" and disdain of created things was spurred in part by the failure of the Crusades as well as "the wealth and wickedness of the clergy." The Church was "rich and largely worldly" and "many priests were grossly immoral," even engaging in sexual abuse in the confessional. The Church also persecuted the Waldenses, a sect practicing poverty and strict virtue. They were condemned but continued to preach, which resulted in Innocent III calling on the king of France to take up a crusade against them. He did so in 1209, carrying out a massacre. The "ferreting out of heresy" was then turned over to the Inquisition, founded by Gregory IX in 1233. The accused were not given counsel, and if condemned they were turned over to secular authorities. If secular authorities "failed to burn [them]," such negligence could be punished as well.

The Italian saint, Francis of Assisi, represented the saintly side of Christianity. He and his order of monks followed the strictest vow of poverty. What makes Saint Francis unique, in Russell's view, is "his spontaneous happiness, his universal love, and his gifts as a poet. His goodness appears always devoid of effort." After his death his order abandoned its poverty and became leaders of Inquisitorial persecution in several countries. "The Dominicans were even more active than the Franciscans in the work of the Inquisition," says Russell. Founded by Saint Dominic (1170–1221), a fanatic for orthodoxy, they became devoted to learning after the death of their founder and worked to reconcile Aristotle with Christianity. Saint Thomas Aquinas was a Dominican monk.

## Analysis

[Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) devotes Book 2, Part 2, Chapter 10 to the effect of Islamic culture on Western civilization and philosophy. In the centuries after Mohammed's death in 632, the caliphate, or political and religious entity under Islam, significantly expanded its territory through conquest. The Islamic Golden Age generally dates from the 8th century until the 13th century, a period of economic and cultural growth. Throughout the 8th and 9th centuries a translation movement began under the first Abbasid caliphs, who founded the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, a library and translation institute. The Muslims supervised translation of medical, scientific, and philosophical texts from Greek or Syriac (the language of the Syrians), including works by [Aristotle](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Aristotle) and [Plato](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Plato).

The Arabic texts were later translated into Latin in Europe, with most of the work done in Spain, where many people knew both Latin and Arabic. Averroes, a native of Córdoba in Spain, was polymath and master of both Aristotelian and Islamic philosophy and a philosopher in his own right. His extensive and thorough commentaries were very important in shaping late medieval understanding of Aristotle. By the end of the 12th century almost all of Aristotle's works had been translated into Latin along with commentaries, and by the mid-13th century they were widely known among scholars. As a result medieval Scholastic philosophers embraced Aristotle and integrated his thinking into Catholic theology.

Russell shows in his chapters on the 12th and 13th century how the papacy increased its power. One theme that comes up in these chapters and is recurring in Russell's treatise is the mass slaughter of Jews. The Crusades turned out to be occasions to carry out pogroms (mass killing events) against the Jews as a sidelight to reclaiming land conquered by Muslims. No doubt Russell is thinking about the slaughter of Jews in concentration camps in Germany as he is writing in 1943, and he is drawing a parallel between the historical persecution of the Jews by Christians for hundreds of years and the launching of Hitler's "final solution" for the Jews. In the 20th century Europeans in many countries stood by, turned a blind eye, or participated in the killing—something that was not new.

Russell also returns to the theme of Church corruption. While the 11th century was a time for cleaning house, reform was short-lived as the some clergy engaged in worse institutional misconduct. According to Russell, this is because the reform made the clergy feel secure in their moral prestige, which gave them cover for bad behavior. Russell describes political finagling and backroom deals being made at the highest levels, the accumulation of fabulous wealth, and widespread sexual abuse of the laity. Some of the abuse was carried out during the sacrament of confession, during which a penitent receives absolution for their sins. In the 13th century the Church also began widespread persecution of heretics, beginning in France with the Albigenses.

The Inquisition was launched in 1233 to smoke out heretics and false conversions. By 1252 the Church had sanctioned torture as a method of extracting the secrets of the accused. The Inquisition petered out by the end of the Middle Ages but was taken up again in the 15th century, most notoriously as the Spanish Inquisition, conducted by the Spanish government, which eventually was extended to other European countries and even to the New World. While only a small percentage of people were burned to death by Church authorities, the numbers were still in the tens of thousands. Russell is somewhat restrained in his retelling of the worst parts of Catholic history, although at times he is bitter and sardonic and uses understatement as verbal irony. Even though he is an agnostic, Russell shows appreciation for genuine spirituality, for example, in his description of Saint Francis of Assisi. But he is understandably outraged by some of the actions of the Church in the late medieval period.

# Book 2, Part 2, Chapters 13–15 : Catholic Philosophy (The Schoolmen) | Summary

## Summary

### Book 2, Part 2, Chapter 13: Saint Thomas Aquinas

[Saint Thomas Aquinas](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Saint_Thomas_Aquinas) is considered the greatest of the Scholastic philosophers by the Church, and his system is taught in Catholic institutions as the only correct one. This has been true since Pope Leo XIII issued a papal decree on the subject in 1879 calling for the revival of Saint Thomas's Scholastic philosophy, says [Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/). Unlike his contemporaries Saint Thomas had a good understanding of [Aristotle](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Aristotle), reading translations from the Greek not "obscured by Neoplatonic accretions [additions]." Saint Thomas disliked Neoplatonism, even when he found it in Saint Augustine. He persuaded the Church that Aristotle's philosophy is a better fit with Christianity than Platonism and calls the Muslim philosopher Averroes's readings of Aristotle (somewhat heretical from the Church's point of view) a misinterpretation. Saint Thomas's most important work is _Summa contra Gentiles_, followed by _Summa Theologiae_ (_Summa Theologica_).

Russell provides an abstract of some key concepts in _Summa contra Gentiles_. Saint Thomas says there are three ways of knowing God: reason, revelation, and intuition. In Saint Thomas's view human happiness is not the result of moral virtue but rather comes in the contemplation of God. However, the knowledge of God in this life is limited for most people, and they will have to wait for the hereafter to enjoy such bliss.

Saint Thomas shows originality in adapting Aristotle to Christian dogma "with a minimum of alteration" and displays "sharpness and clarity" in distinguishing "arguments derived from reason and arguments derived from revelation." However, his merits "seem scarcely sufficient to justify his immense reputation," says Russell. His appeal to reason seems insincere since he's already reached his conclusions in advance and resorts to faith when he can't square reason with dogma. At the same time he doesn't admit the weakness in his reasoned arguments when they don't fit his religious beliefs. "There is little of the true philosophic spirit in Aquinas," Russell says, and he does not put him on the same level as the best philosophers of Greece or of the modern era.

### Book 2, Part 2, Chapter 14: Franciscan Schoolmen

The three most important Franciscan philosophers are Roger Bacon, Duns Scotus, and William of Occam. Roger Bacon received little notice in his own day but has been praised in the modern era "far beyond his deserts," says Russell. His passion was mathematics and science, and he regularly was suspected of heresy because of his intemperate tongue. He was condemned in 1278 and put in prison for 14 years, dying shortly after release. Unlike his colleagues Bacon valued experimentation. He respected Aristotle as well as the Muslim philosophers, mathematicians, and scientists he read in translation.

Duns Scotus opposed the views of Saint Thomas Aquinas. Scotus is a "moderate realist" who believed in free will and that being is not different from essence. He was interested in evidence, which can be (1) principles known by themselves; (2) things known by experience; and (3) people's actions. There is no difference between being and essence in his view, and the "principle of individuation" (what makes one thing different from another) is form, not matter. Saint Thomas said the essence of two things is identical when they are made of immaterial substances, but different if made of material substances, while Scotus says they are always different. Scotus's view is closer to Platonism. This problem of the nature of essence continued into the modern era of philosophy, and Russell mentions his own work in this regard.

William of Occam was an important English philosopher who became embroiled in political quarrels between the pope and the emperor. After he is excommunicated, Occam was forced to settle in Munich under the protection of the Bavarian emperor Louis IV, who was also at odds with the pope. France and England have grown into outsized political entities in the so-called Empire.

The papacy, also diminished, is dominated by France, so it moves to Avignon in the 14th century. The conflict between the pope and emperor was a standoff between France and Germany allied with England. Opposition to the pope had on the whole taken a new tone—a desire for more democracy. William was peripherally involved in the Conciliar Movement, which sought to push back against the absolutism of the pope.

With regard to philosophy, Occam is best known for his "razor," or not unnecessarily multiplying entities. In fact, he said: "It is vain to do with more what can be done with fewer." Occam was also associated with nominalism, a later philosophical school holding that universals or general principles are simply names that do not correspond with an actual reality. Occam faulted Scotus for misinterpreting Aristotle through a Platonic lens. This was particularly true in discussing Aristotle's categories, which are not meant to be metaphysical. William saw logic as an instrument to use in understanding the natural world, independent of metaphysics. The terms and concepts of logic were not things in themselves but vehicles for understanding the physical world. Occam's secular attitude toward philosophy encouraged scientific research.

### Book 2, Part 2, Chapter 15: The Eclipse of the Papacy

At the end of the second part of his treatise Bertrand Russell sums up the Catholic synthesis. Christianity took from Judaism the concept of a sacred book and the doctrine that all religions but theirs are false. The afterlife is not new, but Christians give "new definiteness to heaven and hell." Persian dualism (as in the Manichean idea of separate gods for good and evil) was absorbed, although the omnipotence of the good principle was more dominant. Beginning with the philosopher Origen, Christians developed "an adequate philosophy by modification of Neoplatonism." The Church took a note from the East in promoting the exceptionality of the priesthood and used Roman ideas of government to create its power structure. Over time Augustinian philosophy, largely Platonic, was enriched with new ideas from Aristotle, who became known in the 13th century and established, primarily by Thomas Aquinas, as "the supreme authority after Scripture and the Church."

The disintegration of the Catholic synthesis began with the rift between East (the Byzantine Empire) and West, after the latter conquered Constantinople in the last Crusade in 1204. Although the Byzantine Empire was restored in 1261 and a council held in 1438 seemed to reunite the churches of the East and the West, this was mere window dressing, and they grew further apart. The growing power of nation states weakened the papacy, along with the rise of a rich commercial class and a laity demanding more power. The popes lost moral authority in their quarrels with both the emperors and religious within the Church. Pushback against papal dominion was sometimes "a Puritan horror of the corruption and worldliness of the papal court." At the end of the chapter Russell gives an account of the "Great Schism," which is actually the second schism, the first being the split between the Eastern and Western churches, occurring in 1054. The second crisis began in 1378 and lasted 40 years, with rival popes attempting to claim the Holy See. The Conciliar Movement successfully healed the breech at the Council of Constance, ensuring that Martin V was the pope in 1417.

## Analysis

Although Bernard [Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) was writing in the early 1940s, what he says about the stature of [Saint Thomas Aquinas](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Saint_Thomas_Aquinas) among Catholics remains true. According the _Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy_, the Catholic Church has consistently reiterated the central importance of Saint Thomas's work for understanding Church doctrine on revelation. The _Stanford_ entry on Saint Thomas says anyone would recognize his writings as philosophical, and his dozen commentaries on [Aristotle](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Aristotle) are garnering more interest and respect among Aristotelian philosophers. Russell, on the other hand, says Saint Thomas lacked the "true philosophical spirit" and does not follow an argument where it leads. "Before he begins to philosophize, he already knows the truth; it is declared in the Catholic faith," says Russell. However, British philosopher Anthony Kenny says that such a remark coming from a man "who takes hundreds of pages to prove that one and one make two" is somewhat ironic—meaning Russell himself philosophizes in his _Principia Mathematica_ about what he sees as a foregone conclusion. Kenny defends Saint Thomas, saying he reaches many novel conclusions and never endorses an argument simply because he supports it.

Russell also notes that Saint Thomas says practically nothing about the third way of knowing God, which is intuition, indicating his temperament is very far from mysticism. An interesting sidelight on Saint Thomas, however, is that he appears to have experienced God in a mystical encounter at the end of his life and stopped philosophizing, putting his pen aside and never completing his treatise _Summa Theologica_. When questioned, he answered either, "I cannot go on ... All that I have written seems to me like so much straw compared to what I have seen and what has been revealed to me." Or "I can do no more. Such secrets have been revealed to me that all I have written now appears to be of little value."

Of the Franciscan schoolmen Russell highlights William of Occam, saying that a modern philosophical outlook is often read into what Occam said. In fact, his primary agenda was simply to restore "pure Aristotle, freed from both Augustinian and Arabic influences." Occam's razor urges scientific interpretation without assuming "hypothetical entities," a principle Russell says he has found to be most useful in logical analysis.

The last chapter in Part 2 on Catholic philosophy sums up the Catholic synthesis and briefly explains how it disintegrated. According to Russell, the rift between the Eastern and Western churches occurred when the West conquered Constantinople and ruled the city from 1204 to 1261. However, the churches had already split in the East-West Schism of 1054, which began as an argument between the pope and the patriarch of Constantinople about enforcing Latin Church customs on the Greek Catholics in southern Italy. The second schism (also called the Great Schism or the Great Western Schism) is the fallout from keeping the papal court in Avignon, France, for 70 years and then moving it back to Rome. This resulted in rival popes at each seat excommunicating each other until they were reined in by representatives of the Conciliar Movement, which was a movement within the structure of Catholicism to curb abuses of papal power. While the papacy is restored with one pope, the Conciliar Movement is eventually condemned in 1870 by the First Vatican Council. The fiasco of dueling popes leaves a permanent scar, and it is only a matter of time until additional forces will come together to deconstruct the monolith that is the Catholic Church.

#  Book 3, Part 1, Chapters 1–3 : Modern Philosophy (From the Renaissance to Hume) | Summary

## Summary

### Book 3, Part 1, Chapter 1: General Characteristics

The modern outlook differs from the medieval worldview primarily in "the diminishing authority of the Church, and the increasing authority of science." States replaced the Church as the controller of culture. Beginning with the American and French revolutions, democracy became a powerful political force. Democracy bred liberalism, the kind associated with commerce. The rejection of religious authority eventually led to acceptance of scientific authority, but a long battle was fought before the religionists gave ground. Science's authority was recognized by most modern philosophy, but its basis was intellectual, not governmental. Unlike Catholic dogma, science offered a partial view: its "pronouncements ... are made tentatively, on a basis of probability, and are regarded as liable to modification." Practical science had nearly overshadowed theoretical science, and "the practical importance of science was first recognized in connection with war." Even the physicist Galileo Galilei and the artist and engineer Leonardo da Vinci worked for the government on war products. Freedom from Church authority led to the growth of individualism and even increased anarchy. For the most part philosophy kept this subjective, individualist bias, evident in the first important philosopher of the modern period, René Descartes. The philosophies in the modern era inspired by scientific technique (technology) were "power philosophies," says [Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/), regarding "everything ... as mere raw material." Only the ends were considered. This "is a form of madness," for Russell, and a dangerous one, for which "sane philosophy" should find an antidote.

### Book 3, Part 1, Chapter 2: The Italian Renaissance

Modernity began with the Renaissance, which blossomed in the 15th century among cultivated Italians, both churchmen and laity. With a few exceptions the Renaissance men had no interest in science and "substituted the authority of the ancients for that of the Church." Italy was mostly free of foreign interference from about 1250 to 1494 (when Charles VIII invaded Italy). Italy had five important political entities: Milan, Venice, Florence, the Papal States, and Naples. Genoa came under Milan's control in 1378. Florence was the center of the Renaissance and something of a plutocracy (an oligarchy of the rich) run by the Medici family. The temporal power of the pope increased during this period. The Church's temporal power consisted in its rule of papal lands, called the Papal States. The popes encouraged the humanism of the day, which held classical culture in higher regard than Church culture. Russell characterizes Pope Alexander VI (r. 1492–1503) as wicked, along with his son Caesar Borgia. Among other transgressions, they illegally tried to enlarge papal landholdings. Pope Julius II (r. 1503–13) continued this work and was successful in increasing the temporal papal domain. Power politics and political intrigue among the Italian states were quite complicated, with constant wars—though mostly bloodless—which did not interfere with trade.

The Renaissance is not known for its philosophy, but it paved the way for the more philosophical 17th century by breaking the Scholastic system, reviving the study of [Plato](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Plato), and promoting genuine firsthand knowledge of both Plato and [Aristotle](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Aristotle). The attitude of the Renaissance scholars toward the Church was ambiguous. These men were freethinkers, but they still want to receive "extreme unction" (the last rites of the Catholic Church administered to the dying) on their deathbeds. They were disgusted by the vices of churchmen, but they learned to live with it. In fact many of these men relied on the Church for patronage. The papal lands accounted for little of the Church's revenues, says Russell; most of it is from "tribute, drawn from the whole Catholic world, by means of a theological system which maintained that the popes held the keys of heaven." A rich Church was good for Italy and good for Italians, so it was best for urbane men not to rock the boat. While the Renaissance was bad for morality, it was good for architecture, painting, and poetry, unleashing a torrent of creativity once society was liberated from the straightjacket of medieval culture. But when the social system was dissolved, excess ensued. This seesaw of too much control and too much freedom continued to be a problem with no solution in the modern era.

### Book 3, Part 1, Chapter 3: Machiavelli

An important political philosopher of Renaissance Italy was Niccolò Machiavelli, a man "free from humbug," with a philosophy both "scientific and empirical, based upon his own experience of affairs." He expounded on "the means to assigned ends," without any moral prejudice. More simply, he approved whatever means it takes to achieve a given ends. His most famous work is _The Prince_, written in 1513 and dedicated to Lorenzo di Medici. Machiavelli had fallen out of favor with the family, but he could not worm his way back into the government of Florence and was forced to spend the rest of his life as a writer. His second volume, _Discourses_, provides a very different view of political philosophy.

_The Prince_ has the object of figuring out how principalities (political entities) win, keep, and lose power. Machiavelli praises those who are skillful in doing so and does not judge their morality. To achieve a political end, power is needed. Since power often depends on opinion, it is important to appear virtuous or religious. Machiavelli expresses the idea that "civilized men are almost certain to be unscrupulous egoists."

In _Discourses_ Machiavelli creates an ethical hierarchy and says religion is important to the state for its role as "social cement." He prefers democratic governments because they are less cruel, unscrupulous, and inconsistent than tyrannies. Most of the book reads as if it were written by an 18th-century liberal, Russell says. Machiavelli delineates a system of governmental checks and balances, for example, and the word _liberty_ is used frequently to describe something precious—though never defined.

Russell concludes Machiavelli's political thinking is shallow, since he doesn't grasp the modern conception that community grows organically and evolves over time. However, this more modern view may no longer be true in the present and the future, Russell says. He mentions the mechanistic societies of Russia and Germany, which are "a terrifying reality." In fact the world has become more Machiavellian in Russell's view, and the philosopher who wishes to refute Machiavelli must indeed think deeply.

## Analysis

[Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) associates liberalism with commerce because the safeguarding of private property and the ability to profit from business are essential in the formation and growth of democracy. Whenever an autocratic government is overthrown by a popular uprising, the middle class is always at the forefront of the revolution and makes up the majority of the revolutionary element. This is because those who have accumulated some wealth and/or property have the most to gain from a change in leadership. The ascendency of the middle class is a key factor in the French and American revolutions. In modern democracies, which are not truly democracies (one person, one vote) but representative democracies or republics, the government counterbalances unbridled capitalism, which can become as oppressive for the majority of people as life under other types of autocratic governments.

Liberalism is traditionally suspicious of government but sees it as a necessary evil that should protect people's individual rights, especially their right to make money. This is what Russell means when he uses the terms _liberalism_ and _libertarian_. Liberalism is a compromise between anarchy and autocracy, or between social control and individual freedom, as Russell notes. But in modern times liberalism has come to be associated with "the welfare state," or a government that plays a much greater role in providing an economic safety net for its citizens. Liberals in the modern era also look to the government to regulate business and protect citizens from the worst abuses of capitalism. Nowadays the term _libertarian_ has come to mean a doctrine that harkens back to the more traditional form of liberalism.

In speaking of science Russell recognizes how practical science is wedded to the machinery of war. Certainly it is true that the progress of any civilization is marked by advances in weaponry, and some have even argued that such advanced killing machinery is necessary to move civilization forward. As Russell notes, science and technology are neutral, and it is up to human beings to decide whether they will be used for good or ill. No doubt in the midst of World War II, Russell is thinking of the level of destruction that has become possible because of new weapons. For example, while genocide was nothing new, the level on which Adolf Hitler was able to carry out his killing program in concentration camps was the result of advances in technology. The bombs that are dropped on cities are bigger and more powerful than ever before. In the year Russell published _A History of Western Philosophy_, the United States dropped the first nuclear weapons on two cities in Japan, and the author later became involved in the antinuclear movement. Russell ends this chapter by saying the modern world seems to be moving toward "a social order imposed by force, representing the will of the powerful rather than the hopes of common men." A new philosophy is needed, one that combines the "solidity of the Roman Empire with the idealism of Saint Augustine's City of God."

The Italian Renaissance is not focused on science, but rather on culture and the revival of the "ancients," which is something like nostalgia for a nobler and less complicated era. Russell characterizes the attitude of the urbane and secular Italians as one in which they look askance at the corruption of the Church but accept it as part of doing business in a modern world. For example, Pope Julius II was the greatest patron of the arts Italy has ever seen as well as a powerful military leader who restored the Papal States and even expanded the papacy's territory. He commissioned artwork by Renaissance giants like architect Donato Bramante, painter Raphael, and painter and sculptor Michelangelo. Michelangelo Buonarroti, perhaps the greatest visual artist who ever lived, completed his arresting statue of Moses and the magnificent paintings of the Sistine Chapel at the behest of Pope Julius. Although no saint, Pope Julius is an improvement over the corrupt men who preceded him—most notoriously the Borgia popes and other Borgia clergy. For example, Borgia pope Alexander VI has several children by his mistress, and the Borgias engage in unapologetic simony (selling of clerical offices) and nepotism (awarding of jobs to relatives) to further their family's fortunes. Machiavelli's famous (or infamous, as the case may be) political philosophy expounded in _The Prince_ is an apt reflection of the times, and Machiavelli had plenty of examples from life to work with, since in his role as a statesman and diplomat he had spent a lot of time with the Borgias.

The Renaissance began later in the northern European countries than in Italy, but at the beginning of the 16th century, new learning had been successfully introduced to France, England, and Germany without controversy. [Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) characterizes the Italian Renaissance as "anarchic and amoral" and the northern Renaissance as "associated with piety and public virtue." He then relates the influences of Erasmus and Saint Thomas More in the north.

Desiderius Erasmus, a Dutch monk, became good friends with More after he visited England for the first time. Erasmus was an exceptional Latinist who later taught himself Greek. In 1516 he published an annotated Greek New Testament alongside a Latin translation and pointed out numerous inaccuracies in Saint Jerome's version of the Bible. Erasmus's Testament is later used as ammunition by the Protestants against the Catholics. Erasmus also published _The Praise of Folly_, a satirical work that took aim in places at some of the abuses of the Church—such as selling indulgences. (An _indulgence_ is the remission or reduction of the time a soul spends in purgatory.) When the Reformation began, Erasmus ultimately sided with the Catholics, writing a work in 1524 defending the concept of free will, which Martin Luther rejected based on a very narrow reading of Saint Augustine.

Saint Thomas More is best known as the Catholic martyr beheaded for treason by King Henry VIII and the author of _Utopia_. Although not a member of the Catholic clergy, More was a humanist and pious Catholic appointed Henry's chancellor. However, he refused to approve Henry's divorce from his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, or sign a parliamentary act declaring Henry the head of the Church of England. More's _Utopia_ is an imaginative portrait of a society that, like the one in [Plato](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Plato)'s _Republic_, holds all property in common. Russell finds More's vision "astonishingly liberal," less for its communism and more for its views on war, nonviolence, and religious toleration.

### Book 3, Part 1, Chapter 5: The Reformation and the Counter-Reformation

Russell calls the Reformation "the rebellion of less civilized nations against the intellectual domination of Italy." The Reformation was both political and theological in its revolt against the authority of the pope. The Counter-Reformation was a revolt against the humanism and amorality of the Italian Renaissance. The Counter-Reformation did not challenge the power of the pope but, rather, restored the idea that the office should be a paragon of probity. Russell sees the Reformation as German and the Counter-Reformation as Spanish. The most important figures in these movements, all medieval in their philosophical thinking, are Martin Luther, John Calvin, and St. Ignatius of Loyola. Martin Luther and John Calvin both broke with the Catholic Church and created new interpretations of Christian teaching. Both also relied on portions of Saint Augustine to support their beliefs. They denied teachings about purgatory (the immaterial realm in the afterlife where Catholics purge the stain of sin) and condemned the practice of selling indulgences, "upon which a large part of the papal revenue depended." The doctrine of predestination, or the predetermined fate of the soul after death, bypassed the priests in accomplishing individual salvation. Protestants were willing to follow England in acknowledging the sovereign as the head of the Church, which increased royal power. Nonetheless, some minority sects refused to replace the pope with a king, and they were persecuted by the majority Protestants.

Protestantism was checked by the work of Saint Ignatius of Loyola's Jesuit order, the soldiers of the Counter-Reformation. Loyola had been a soldier, and he used the military model in building an army of priests to battle heresy. The Jesuits rejected those portions of Saint Augustine's theology the Protestants emphasized—particularly supporting free will against predestination. The Jesuits were also successful missionaries, popular as confessors, and noted as educators. But they are merciless with heretics, reestablishing "the terror of the Inquisition, even in Italy, which had had nearly a century of free-thought."

The results of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation were good in the long run, says Russell, since the enforcement of "doctrinal unity" came to an end. "Disgust with theological warfare turned the attention of able men increasingly to secular learning, especially mathematics and science."

### Book 3, Part 1, Chapter 6: The Rise of Science

Russell emphatically states the modern world is a product of science, which began in the 17th century and profoundly influenced philosophy. Russell names René Descartes as the founder of modern philosophy and Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton as most important in the creation of modern science.

Nicolaus Copernicus (1473–1543), an amateur astronomer, arrived at the hypothesis that Earth and known planets revolve around the sun, upending the geocentric view of the world (with Earth at the center). He also said that Earth has a daily rotation. Copernicus published his work on heliocentric theory the year of his death and dedicates his treatise to the pope. _De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium_ (_On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres_) escaped condemnation until Galileo revived Copernicus's ideas.

Mathematician and astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571–1630) adopted the heliocentric theory and discovered three laws of planetary motion, which he published in 1609 and 1619, the first of which states that the planets move in an elliptical orbit around the sun. This finding overturned centuries of aesthetic bias insisting planets move in perfect circles, since they are celestial orbs and even gods (in Greek philosophy) or heavenly bodies created by God (in Catholic philosophy).

Galileo Galilei made important discoveries in astronomy and dynamics. He was the first to establish the law of falling bodies (acceleration of falling bodies is constant apart from any other interference or resistance). He also studied projectiles and showed how "when several forces act simultaneously, the effect is as if each acted in turn." After adopting the heliocentric theory, Galileo corresponded with Kepler, fashioned his own telescope, and discovered the four moons of Jupiter. Condemned by the Inquisition, first privately and then publicly in 1633, Galileo ultimately denied Earth rotates or revolves around the sun to save his life.

Isaac Newton (1642–1727) was a physicist and mathematician who discovered the three laws of motion (the first two owing to Galileo), along with the universal law of gravitation: "Every body attracts every other with a force directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them." Using this formula, scientists calculated motions of planets, orbits of comets, and sea tides. Newton's influence was so profound that a century had to pass before scientists could free themselves from his authority "sufficiently to do important original work in the subjects of which he had treated."

By the end of the century scientific law had "established its hold on men's imaginations," rendering many medieval beliefs absurd. God became further removed from his creation. Although most scientists were religious, their work disturbed the orthodoxy. Man's place in the universe had also changed, with Earth demoted to the status of a minor planet revolving around a somewhat ordinary star. Russell briefly touches on Albert Einstein and the physicists of quantum mechanics, saying they have radically changed the view of the universe since Galileo and Newton.

## Analysis

In [Book 3, Part 1, Chapters 4–6](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/book-3-part-1-chapters-4-6-summary/) [Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) provides his analysis of the social, political, and religious currents that transform the European worldview of the 15th and 16th centuries. To call the Italian Renaissance "anarchic and immoral" seems somewhat exaggerated. It may be more accurate to call the Italian Renaissance secular while the Northern Renaissance is religious and reformist.

In the prosperous city-states in northern and central Italy, a new mercantile class had gained political and cultural ascendency. The Medici banking family in Florence became a political dynasty and was a great patron of the arts. The Catholic Church continued to lose credibility as God's representative organization on earth, following the Western Schism and the continued corruption of the popes and the clergy. Humanism, a new mode of thinking that puts human beings at the center of inquiry and seeks to improve them without necessarily relying on religion, became part of a growing secularization in Italy. The revival of classical literature went hand in hand with the humanist movement, as people interested in developing moral philosophy looked further afield for guidance.

Although a monk and firmly attached to Catholicism, the philosopher Desiderius Erasmus is an example of an early humanist who criticized the Church and called for a return to a purer Christianity. Erasmus, like Martin Luther, objected to the practice of selling indulgences.

According to Catholic practice, the faithful confess their sins to a priest during the sacrament of confession and then receive absolution or forgiveness from God, but this forgiveness is predicated on the completion of a penance to make up for the sin. Catholics also must undergo additional penances in _purgatory_ after they die, a sort of vestibule in which souls are made to suffer until they are sufficiently purified for heaven. Penance on earth may be carried out in the form of prayer and good works, but indulgences can be used in lieu of penance to cancel sin. Indulgences are granted only by the pope, and by the 13th century they are being sold for the remission of sin. As the sale of indulgences grows, they are extended to cover the penance of purgatory.

Pope Leo X (r. 1513–21), a Medici, stepped up the selling of indulgences, first encouraged by his predecessor, Julius II, to help fund the building of Saint Peter's in Rome. Dominican monk Johann Tetzel vigorously hawked indulgences in Germany, which is the immediate event precipitating Martin Luther's revolt against the Church. He is the first, but by no means only, heretic to start a new version of Christianity. King Henry VIII of England, himself a staunch defender of the Church against Luther, defied the Church over his need for an annulment and as a result became the first secular religious authority. Thus began the idea of "divine right of kings," and over time the kings of Europe wrested more and more power away from the Church. The Protestant Reformation, which is an internal revolt (Martin Luther is a Catholic priest and John Calvin a devout Catholic), frees Christians to engage directly with God, removing the priests and the bishops as middlemen. Thus the Catholic Church, whom Saint Augustine has called God's "chaste city" and which has been the source of all authority in justifying the ways of God to man, is put in second place, behind the individual's conscience. No doubt Protestants went on to create their own dogmas, but for a moment in time the Reformation rides the current of the Northern Renaissance and becomes the revived face of religious virtue.

The Catholic Church responded to the Protestant revolt by instituting a Counter-Reformation, which restored a great deal of its credibility among remaining Catholics. As part of the Catholic reforms, the Church stepped up its missionary efforts in the Americas and other parts of the world. Reforms in the monasteries produced two of the Church's great mystics, the Spanish saints Teresa of Avila and John of the Cross. Spain also became the center of a new Inquisition, cracking down on heretics. The Inquisition in the retrospection of history may be seen as the last gasp of the old Christian order to impose its theological view on a world that has suddenly become much larger and no longer containable.

The worldview of Europeans was also transformed by the Scientific Revolution. Despite the best efforts of the Church the geocentric view of the solar system was replaced by the heliocentric view, and human beings were thus demoted in a metaphorical sense, in the grand hierarchy of the cosmos. Kepler and Galileo follow Copernicus, and Newton follows Galileo—all articulating a new structure of the known world in scientific terms. In the 20th century Galileo's heliocentric view and Newton's physics were displaced by the physics of Albert Einstein and the founders of quantum mechanics—specifically, Max Planck, Niels Bohr, Louis de Broglie, and Erwin Schrodinger.

## Summary

### Book 3, Part 1, Chapter 7: Francis Bacon

According to [Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/), Francis Bacon was the founder of the modern inductive method and a pioneer in systematizing the scientific method. Following his father, Bacon chose a career in politics and became Lord Chancellor to Queen Elizabeth I of England in 1618. His political enemies engineered his downfall, however, and two years later he was driven out of office after being accused of taking bribes. The purpose of philosophy in Bacon's view is to "give mankind mastery over the forces of nature by means of scientific discoveries and inventions." Philosophy, which depends on reason, and theology, which rests on revelation, should be maintained as separate disciplines. He advocated for the maintenance of a "double truth," accepting orthodox religion himself. How sincere Bacon was about religion is not known, but he did think reason could be used to establish the existence of God.

Bacon is known for naming the "idols" or bad habits of mind that lead people astray intellectually. For example, the "idols of the cave" are one's personal prejudices, and "idols of the theater" are received systems of thought that people take for granted and follow without thinking. Bacon is most important for being the first philosopher of science to emphasize "the importance of induction as opposed to deduction." He attempted to establish a method of induction that goes beyond enumeration (keeping track of instances that point to a generality) but was unable to do so. Today's scientists acknowledge the importance of both inductive and deductive logic in the work they do.

### Book 3, Part 1, Chapter 8: Hobbes's Leviathan

Thomas Hobbes was an English philosopher and early empiricist best known for his work of political philosophy, _Leviathan_. Hobbes was an extreme royalist (someone supporting rule by monarchy). He lived through an era of political turmoil in which the English "Long Parliament" ended up executing King Charles I. Hobbes fled to France and remained there 11 years, associating with royalist refugees. He eventually returned to London and submitted himself to Oliver Cromwell, England's ruler from 1653 to 1658.

_Leviathan_ is Hobbes's argument for the necessity of the populace to submit to an absolute ruler. The commonwealth, called "Leviathan," is an artificial (created) man, and sovereignty is an artificial soul. The first part of this treatise discusses the nature of man, who desires self-preservation while wishing to dominate others. Human nature results in a constant state of war and makes life "nasty, brutish, and short." In war force and fraud are the important virtues. To escape the evil of war, people form communities ruled by a central authority. People submit to authority in the interests of self-preservation. Men's agreement with one another in a covenant is to obey the ruling power the majority has chosen. With that choice they relinquish all power and have no right to rebel, since the ruler is not bound by a contract to them. While Hobbes prefers a monarchy, Russell points out that Hobbes's arguments can apply to any form of government "in which there is one supreme authority not limited by the legal rights of other bodies." After summarizing other parts of _Leviathan_, Russell turns to the question of what to make of it.

Every community faces two opposing dangers—anarchy and despotism. Hobbes was terrified by anarchy and "liberal philosophers who arose after the Restoration ... realized both dangers." This led to [John Locke](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#John_Locke)'s ideas about the separation of powers. In countries with checks and balances, there is the constant tendency for power to accumulate in one sector: "In Germany, Italy, Russia, and Japan, the government has even more power than Hobbes thought desirable." In Russell's view the world has moved, after a long period of liberalism, in Hobbes's direction. While Russell admits that an absolute state can prevent anarchy, it can also become so bad that anarchy is preferable. The tendency of governments to become tyrannies can be checked only by fear of rebellion. Otherwise, in the political sphere, leaders will hold onto power for too long; in the economic sphere they will enrich themselves at the expense of the public, and in the intellectual sphere they will suppress knowledge that threatens their power.

Hobbes is clear and logical in his analysis, says Russell, and is the first "really modern writer on political theory." His ideas deserve to be pondered and refuted. Two important charges may be brought against him: (1) He does not consider that different groups of citizens have different interests—for example, different class interests. Thus the interests of the ruler are not identical with all his subjects. (2) Hobbes's doctrine does not take into consideration relations between and among different states. If there is anarchy internationally, more control and efficiency on the state (nation) level will not necessarily make people safer, but rather, increase the ferocity of war. States will continue to fight each other, improving their weapons, for example. This will leave humanity without the means of preventing war and can lead to planetary destruction.

## Analysis

Francis Bacon is considered by some to be the first philosopher of modern science. He embodied the Renaissance spirit as a statesman, politician, and essayist. Bacon was somewhat exceptional in his objections to the worship of [Aristotle](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Aristotle), and he criticized the Scholastic philosophers for their wholesale adoption of Greek views. Bacon was the first to champion the inductive method, and he stressed the importance of the "mechanical arts," the precursor of technology. What Bacon also did is provide the philosophical and theological underpinning for the attitude that nature is merely man's instrument, provided by God. In his view man is the highest being in creation, and human beings have a God-given right to bend nature to their will. Science historian Carolyn Merchant argues that the objectification of nature became solidified following the Scientific Revolution and is responsible for attitudes that have allowed for the wholesale destruction of parts of the natural environment, which continues today and threatens species survival. [Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) is also concerned with the dangers of unbridled technology, specifically with regard to war, although he doesn't mention that Bacon early on set the tone for scientific overconfidence.

While René Descartes was founding rationalist philosophy, Thomas Hobbes was at work (also in France) attempting to forestall democracy with philosophy. Russell doesn't fully explain how the English parliament became an instrument of revolutionary change in the 17th century. England was the first country in Europe to move toward democratic governance, beginning in 1215, when the document Magna Carta established some rights for the nobility and a proto-Parliament. More than 400 years later, King Charles I waged war with Scotland and later Ireland and was forced to convene the "Long Parliament" in 1640, which ended up sitting for 20 years. As Russell notes, Hobbes fled to France in that year because Parliament executed two of the king's men, and perhaps he saw the writing on the wall. Parliament crossed swords with the king over who will control the army, and war broke out between the king and the Parliamentarians in 1642. The king eventually was tried and executed in 1649. A republic was established as the Commonwealth of England (including Wales, Ireland, and Scotland), under the Puritan leader Oliver Cromwell as Lord Protector. The English monarchy was restored under Charles's son, Charles II, in 1660, and he rewarded his former tutor Hobbes with a pension. Charles II shared power with Parliament until he dissolved it in 1681. England became a constitutional monarchy in 1688, after the Glorious Revolution, a bloodless deposition of King James II, who was replaced by his daughter Mary and her husband William.

Hobbes was well aware of Descartes's work, and he rejected his dualism in favor of a monistic materialism in which the only reality that exists is bodies in motion. In Hobbes's pessimistic view all organisms fight for their survival, so all actions are rooted in self-interest and a desire for power. Naturally his preference for an absolutist state that will keep people in check grew out of this belief. _Leviathan_ is the English translation of a Hebrew word from the Bible, which refers to a sea monster or "tortuous serpent." Hobbes took up the term to name the manmade monster of the absolute state, which though monstrous is better than the "state of nature," in which primitive man is at the mercy of want and fear. Clearly Hobbes preferred security over freedom, and the majority of the human race seems to be in agreement with him, judging from the number of totalitarian states that have existed and still exist and the fact that democratic states are always in danger of falling into chaos or absolutism.

# Book 3, Part 1, Chapters 9–11 : Modern Philosophy (From the Renaissance to Hume) | Summary

## Summary

### Book 3, Part 1, Chapter 9: Descartes

René Descartes was "profoundly affected by the new physics and astronomy" and sought to construct a new philosophical edifice, according to [Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/). His greatest contribution is the invention of coordinate geometry (also called analytic geometry), which applies algebra to geometry. His two most important philosophical works are _Discourse on Method_ and the _Meditations on First Philosophy_.

Descartes's philosophy begins with his famous radical doubt (Cartesian doubt) upon which he will build his edifice. He can think of only one thing that is certain: he is thinking. "I think, therefore I am," he exclaims, which became the new first principle of philosophy. This idea was not actually new, since Saint Augustine raised the same notion in his _Confessions_. Descartes's originality, however, was in grasping the importance of this idea, which "makes mind more certain than matter, and my mind (for me) more certain than the minds of others." Russell explains that "all philosophy derived from Descartes [has] a tendency to subjectivism," regarding matter as knowable only by inference. Descartes moved from his first idea to the notion of himself as a _thing who thinks_ and therefore a substance whose nature consists in thinking, and which "needs no place or material thing for its existence." The soul, therefore (inherent in thinking), is distinct from the body and would be what it is whether the body existed or not. When it comes to bodies, Descartes determined they are subject to transformation, which confuses the senses. For this reason perception is defined as "an inspection of the mind." Knowledge of externals is in the mind, not in the senses.

Russell faults Descartes for his logic, since he hasn't proved that thoughts need a thinker; his foundational premise actually should have been "there are thoughts." Nonetheless, Descartes's grammatical construction masquerading as unassailable philosophy resulted in the mind-body split. Thoughts rather than external objects became the "prime empirical certainties." This view has had a lasting effect on philosophy, completing the dualism that began with [Plato](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Plato) and continued through the Scholastic era. Cartesian dualism created two independent phenomena—mind and matter, "each of which can be studied without reference to the other."

### Book 3, Part 1, Chapter 10: Spinoza

Bertrand Russell expresses his admiration for Benedict de Spinoza, calling him the "most lovable of the great philosophers." His chief work, the _Ethics_, is in three parts: metaphysics, psychology of the passions, and ethics. He acknowledged one substance, God or Nature, whereas Descartes acknowledged three—God, mind, and matter. For Spinoza thought and extension (matter) are attributes of God, and all are "aspects of the divine Being." Personal immortality does not exist, but man can impersonally become more one with God. Spinoza does not believe in free will, but rather that everything "is ruled by an absolute logical necessity." All is a manifestation of "God's inscrutable nature." Evil does not exist in God, once it is seen in the context of the whole. Russell points out that Spinoza is a pantheist with a mystical view that cannot be reconciled with sin and damnation.

Spinoza's theory of emotions sees the passions as something that distracts and obscures intellectual vision. Hatred increases when reciprocated, but it can be destroyed by love, Spinoza says. Self-preservation is the motive behind the passions, which lead people into intellectual error. "Spinoza's outlook is intended to liberate men from the tyranny of fear," says Russell, including the fear of death. Spinoza advocates dispassion and acceptance in the face of "logical necessity"—particularly mortality. He counsels that "love of God must hold a chief place in the mind," although it is silly to expect God to love humans since God has no passions, pleasures, nor pains. Russell calls Spinoza's philosophy "logical monism": the world is one substance, and none of its parts can logically exist alone.

Russell admires Spinoza's ethic of dispassion in reference to self but sympathizes with the natural desire of wanting revenge for crimes committed against loved ones or innocents. Still, "a life dominated by a single passion [i.e., hatred] is a narrow life, incompatible with every kind of wisdom." Spinoza's "belief in the ultimate goodness of the universe" rests on his religious ideas, which Russell does not accept. Yet he can see how this view offers comfort in a "painful world" and "an antidote to the paralysis of utter despair."

### Book 3, Part 1, Chapter 11: Leibniz

Gottfried Leibniz may be "destitute of those higher philosophic virtues" seen in Spinoza, but he is "one of the supreme intellects of all time," according to Bertrand Russell. He invented infinitesimal calculus around the same time as Isaac Newton (they worked independently and later quarreled about who discovered it). Leibniz was influenced by both René Descartes and Benedict de Spinoza, also basing his philosophy on the idea of substance, but he multiplied substance into an infinite number of monads. These monads have some properties of a physical point but are immaterial, since each is a soul. Monads do not have causal relations with one another. Every monad mirrors the universe, however, since God has given them a "pre-established harmony," which makes them appear to interact. The human body is composed of innumerable monads, presided over by the soul of a person. There is no space in Leibniz's view, since this plenum consists of monads.

With Leibniz's exceptional logical abilities, he argued much better than his predecessors for the existence of God, Russell says, although his arguments were still flawed. One thing that Leibniz posits is the idea of an infinite number of possible worlds. At the moment of creation God entertained all iterations and created the best of all possible worlds, in which there is the greatest amount of good in comparison to evil. Russell sarcastically notes this argument made sense to the queen of Prussia. "Her serfs continued to suffer the evil, while she continued to enjoy the good, and it was comforting to be assured by a great philosopher that this was just and right." (Leibniz was the friend and teacher of Queen Sophie Charlotte of Prussia, and she took solace in his ideas about divine justice.)

Leibniz had two philosophies—the one he revealed publicly and the one he kept private. Russell ends this chapter with a short discussion of his unpublished work, which first came to light around 1901, noting that the philosopher could have founded his own school of mathematical logic if he had published certain documents. Leibniz was also a master of using logic to build a system of metaphysics, although he used defective logic to draw inferences from language to nonlinguistic facts.

## Analysis

As [Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) mentions, Descartes was fearful about getting into trouble with religious authorities, as "he shared Galileo's heresies." For this reason he didn't publish his first work, _Le Monde_, which appeared later in fragments after his death. Russell speculates that he is probably "a sincere Catholic, and wished to persuade the Church ... to be less hostile to modern science." According to Donald Palmer, Descartes wished to gently introduce his ideas to the religious establishment "by smuggling them into a book of philosophy called _Meditations_," which is dedicated to the Parisian doctors of theology. Descartes intended to rebuild the edifice of philosophy from the ground up, using reason rather than relying on faith and authority. To do so he must start from scratch by interrogating reason. This is why he began with radical doubt to figure out what can be known for sure. He distrusted the senses because they have been known to lie. He couldn't know with certainty whether he was dreaming. He couldn't even be sure if the universe is run by God or an evil demon. The only thing he could be sure of is that he exists, which is how he arrives at "Cogito ergo sum" (I think, therefore I am).

As Russell explains, his logic used faulty syntax, since he overstepped what he has observed by adding "I" to thinking. Based on Descartes's bad logic, he constructed the dualism that haunts philosophy ever after. He continued with his bad logic to prove the existence of God, and he created mutually exclusive substances (mind and matter) without convincingly explaining how they can affect each other. He assigned to the mind perceivable qualities and to the external world measurable qualities, claiming they meet in the center of the brain in the pineal gland. The mind would have to become the body at that point, but Descartes died before he could address the problem further. In Russell's view there is a subjectivism imbued in all philosophy that descended from Descartes, along with the tendency to think about matter "as something only knowable, if at all, by inference from what is known of mind." These tendencies exist in both "Continental idealism" (i.e., rationalism, a common term used for the philosophy of Descartes, Leibniz, and Spinoza, but one that Russell does not use) and empiricism. Thus modern philosophy has regrettably accepted Descartes's "formulation of its problems ... while not accepting his solutions."

Russell can't help but like Spinoza and does seem to admire his logic. For example, Spinoza says "a man who loves God cannot want God to love him" because it would mean that person does not want God to be God and would desire God to feel pain, "which is absurd." God has no passions in Spinoza's view, so neither hates nor loves. God loves himself, however, "with an infinite intellectual love," which "is possible without false belief." Spinoza is a pantheist, in the strictest sense of the term. All of manifestation is imbued by God, but finite things are determined by negation. Only God can be "wholly positive" and "absolutely infinite." There can be no personal immortality as it is understood in the Christian tradition, but "only that impersonal sort that consists in becoming more and more one with God." Although Russell respects Spinoza (he has arrived at a "logical monism"), he cannot accept his metaphysics since he himself is an empiricist and an agnostic. The "whole of [his] metaphysic ... is incompatible with modern logic and with scientific method. _Facts_ have to be discovered by observation, not by reasoning," and in Russell's view Spinoza has only reasoned his way to his logical monism. In fact, Spinoza may have _experienced_ this view, but if he did it would not have been something he could _show_ Russell or anyone else, any more than a mystic could show him their vision. In any case such experiences do not count as facts for Russell. He does say, however, that something can be accepted from Spinoza, even upon rejecting his metaphysical foundation. He particularly notes Spinoza's statement that "the free man thinks of nothing less than death"; death cannot be avoided so it is useless to worry about it. Similarly, the impulse toward revenge narrows a person's life and is "incompatible with every kind of wisdom."

Russell is more interested in the philosophy that Leibniz did not make public, which proves "him to have been a far more profound thinker than he wished to be thought." These texts, finally published in 1901 or 1903, were ignored for almost two centuries. Russell himself is the first to understand the importance of these "esoteric" texts since he is something of an expert on Leibniz and has carefully studied him (as he mentions in the Preface). Leibniz is a logician, says Russell, and he kept finding evidence of error in [Aristotle](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Aristotle)'s "doctrine of the syllogism" and thought himself mistaken. Russell gives Leibniz kudos in this regard and also calls him "a pioneer in mathematical logic, of which he perceived the importance when no one else did." While his theory of monads is somewhat fantastic, Leibniz's suggestion of two types of space—the subjective perception of an individual monad and the objective perception of "the assemblage of points of view of the various monads"—is still useful in relation to physics, says Russell.

## Summary

### Book 3, Part 1, Chapter 12: Philosophical Liberalism

In discussing the rise of liberalism, [Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) first notes two common errors made by historians. The first is to overestimate the influence of philosophers on history or politics, and the second is to view ideas as "the froth on the surface of deep currents" of history. For Russell, the truth lies between these two extremes. He then traces the development of liberalism from the 17th century until the early 1940s.

Early liberalism developed in the freer atmosphere of England and Holland. Generally it was religiously tolerant, Protestant, and middle class, valuing commerce and respecting the rights of property. Early liberals rejected the divine right of kings and implicitly assumed (a) all men are born equal (they were not much concerned with women) and (b) inequality arose from unequal circumstances. Naturally, they were somewhat biased against the government, run by the kings or aristocracies. Liberalism was also individualistic, and the roots of individualism can be traced back to the Greek philosophers after the golden age of Greece—for example, the Cynics and the Stoics.

Early liberalism dominated the English 18th century and was a founding principle of the American nation; it can also be heard in the more moderate voices of the French Revolution. The antithesis of liberalism began with Jean-Jacques Rousseau and was strengthened by the Romantic and nationalist movements, in which the "anarchic aspects of individualism are made explicit." The cult of the hero developed, with a nostalgia for the Middle Ages and a hatred of modernity. Such philosophy eventually led to "the despotic government of the most successful 'hero.'"

[John Locke](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#John_Locke) made the first comprehensive statement of liberal philosophy, and he was the most influential (although not the profoundest) of modern philosophers. Locke's philosophy was shaped by his times, the last period of civil strife in England, in which the king and Parliament collided over their rights and the rights of people were established.

### Book 3, Part 1, Chapter 13: Locke's Theory of Knowledge

Bertrand Russell calls John Locke the "apostle of the Revolution of 1688," in which James II was driven out of office and the rights of Parliament established. Locke's most important work was _An Essay Concerning Human Understanding_. Russell considers Locke to be the "founder of philosophical liberalism as much as of empiricism in theory of knowledge."

While Locke's philosophy was logical, he was willing to sacrifice logic "rather than become paradoxical." He considered love of truth to be essential, as opposed to love of doctrine. He noted that when "enthusiasm" pushed out reason at the expense of "revelation," it destroyed both reason and revelation, replacing them with individual "fancies." For Locke reason was more like common sense. He says: "God has not been so sparing to men to make them barely two-legged creatures, and left it to [Aristotle](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Aristotle) to make them rational."

Locke says knowledge is derived from experience, making him the first empiricist. Ideas are derived from sensation and "internal sense," or the perception of thinking. Perception is "the first step and degree towards knowledge, and the inlet of all the materials of it," Locke says. He argues that metaphysicians' knowledge of the world is "purely verbal," taking up an emphatically nominalist view of "universals." Everything exists as a particular, although humans give names to general ideas. Locke calls the Scholastic notion of essence a verbal construct.

Good and evil are defined according to whether they deliver pleasure or pain. People act in their own self-interest, and their need to pursue happiness "is the foundation of all liberty." Since they value present pleasure more than future pleasure, they do not maximize pleasure. Moreover, self-interest and society's interests line up only over the long term, so people must exercise prudence in ensuring their long-term interests. Prudence is an essential lynchpin of both liberalism and capitalism, Russell notes. He objects to Locke's ethics on the grounds that the only virtue Locke names is prudence. Further, Russell disagrees that men desire only pleasure.

### Book 3, Part 1, Chapter 14: Locke's Political Philosophy

John Locke rejected the heredity principle as the basis of political power. In his second _Treatise on Government_ he begins by discussing natural law. Man left behind the state of nature when he entered into a social contract that created civil government. Locke contradicts himself in representing "the state of nature as one where every one is virtuous, and at other times discussing what may rightly be done in a state of nature to resist the aggressions of wicked men." In Locke's view natural man has the right to punish attacks not only on himself and his family but also on his property, even with death—he does not make a distinction for different types of thievery. Natural law aligns with the moral rules found in the Bible, according to Locke. This natural law determines right and wrong, and laws made by society ought to be guided by natural law.

Governments have "a _right_ to exact obedience" from the populace by virtue of their agreeing to the social contract. People surrender the right to punish transgressors, and they put retribution in the hands of civil law. "The power of the government by contract, we are told, never extends beyond the common good," but Russell notes that Locke doesn't say who will judge the common good. The most important end in forming a commonwealth is to protect private property, and Locke favors a system in which a man may own as much land as he can cultivate. The idea that the value of a product should be calculated according to the labor expended in making it (the labor theory of value) comes from Locke's philosophy, although it was taken up by Karl Marx and other Communists and Socialists. Russell points out flaws in this theory as well.

The doctrine of checks and balances in the government is characteristic of liberalism, says Russell, which first arose in England to resist the Stuart dynasty. For Locke the king represented the executive and the Parliament the legislative branch, and he believed the latter should be supreme, although subject to removal by the people. Locke's principle of the division of powers "found its fullest application [in] the United States," says Russell, where the three branches of government are independent of one another. Russell deems Locke's philosophy adequate until the Industrial Revolution. Since then, "the power of property, as embodied in vast corporations, [has grown] beyond anything imagined by Locke." The functions of the state have grown enormously as well, and nationalism has created large power centers, both political and economic. Russell believes what is now needed is an international government and a more far-reaching social contract.

### Book 3, Part 1, Chapter 15: Locke's Influence

The heirs of John Locke were the British empiricist philosophers George Berkeley and [David Hume](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#David_Hume); the French _philosophes_ not of the school of Jean-Jacques Rousseau; Jeremy Bentham and the philosophical Radicals (the utilitarians); and Karl Marx. In the United States Locke's ideas underwent little transformation when applied to American constitutional government. The French Enlightenment philosophers saw England as the "home of freedom" and favored Locke's theories. His chief disciple in France was Voltaire. Locke was "tentative in his beliefs, not at all authoritarian, and willing to leave every question to be decided by free discussion." The result was that those who followed him believe in gradual reform. Locke's opponents enjoyed the heroism of war, while for the most part utilitarians and capitalists who followed Locke disliked war. While the enlightened self-interest preached by Locke may not be the noblest of philosophies, those who railed against it often substituted something much worse.

## Analysis

[Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) prefaces his summary of Locke with some background on the development of liberalism. He begins by reiterating his own major theme—that human life as it is lived determines philosophy, and at the same time philosophy influences the specific circumstances of human life. But now he adds a cautionary note against putting too much emphasis either on the influence of philosophers on history or discounting how much history may be influenced by ideas. This prefatory statement is apropos because in Russell's view, [John Locke](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#John_Locke)'s influence on history is not at all proportionate with his mediocre talents as a philosopher. Moreover, he may be giving Locke too much credit for changing the course of history. In some sense Locke has imbibed just the right views to become the right man in the right place at the right time—to say the things that people were already thinking. Locke is the inventor of philosophical liberalism, which has its roots in (1) the pluralism following the Protestant Reformation and (2) the rise of the middle class throughout Europe, as prosperous city-states pave the way for the earliest form of capitalism (mercantilism). Both of these currents created more individual freedom.

John Locke, whom Russell calls an apostle of the Glorious Revolution, conceived a philosophy that paved the way for the 18th-century Age of Enlightenment. Also called the Age of Reason, this intellectual movement primarily based in England and France advocated for individual freedom, as well as freedom from superstition and the autocratic power of the state.

England's civil wars began in 1642, when the Stuart king Charles I fought the Parliamentarians and ended up getting executed. England was then ruled by the Puritan leader Oliver Cromwell until the monarchy was restored under Charles II. After he died, the Catholic king James II ascended the throne and was deposed without a war (the Glorious Revolution) in 1688. This last uprising resulted in the first constitutional monarchy of Europe. William and Mary became the rulers of England after they accepted a Declaration of Rights. The "bloodless revolution" permanently established Parliament, which represented the people, as an important part of the government. It makes sense that England was the first European country to establish a provisional democracy since there is a democratic trend in England that goes back to the signing of the Magna Carta. The Magna Carta is the first document to ensure some rights of the king's subjects—albeit at that point only the aristocracy. So naturally England leads the way in moving from divine kingship to constitutional rule.

In addition to being the first liberal, Locke is also the first empiricist because he says quite plainly that knowledge derives from experience. He is famously known for the idea that people are born as a "blank slate" upon which experience writes. He rejected hereditary rule and opted for a social contract, in which people enter into an agreement with the state in which they give up some of their rights in exchange for protection. For example, under the social contract, a person gives up their right to exact vengeance on someone who takes life or property. This becomes the job of the state. This idea of entering into a contract with the state is very different from Thomas Hobbes's idea, in which people give up all their rights to the state, in perpetuity, in exchange for protection. Rather, for Locke the power of the state is limited by a system of checks and balances in which the people retain more power than the state.

Russell points out some of the contradictions in Locke's philosophy, of which there are many, and notes that the most important purpose for forming a commonwealth is the protection of private property. Thus Russell again emphasizes the connection between individual rights and the growth of capitalism; the capitalist system cannot work without individual rights and liberty. At the same time when capitalist power becomes too vast, it becomes monopoly capitalism, something Russell is concerned about as a committed Socialist. Then capitalism is in danger of becoming fascism, or authoritarian nationalism, in which a small number of individuals control all commerce and curtail individual rights.

Russell sees the value in Locke's philosophy but dislikes his ethics, in which the highest virtue is prudence and people's only desire is for pleasure. Nonetheless, "On the whole, the school which owed its origin to Locke, and which preached enlightened self-interest, did more to increase human happiness, and less to increase human misery, than was done by the schools which despised it in the name of heroism and self-sacrifice," Russell says.

# Book 3, Part 1, Chapters 16–17 : Modern Philosophy (From the Renaissance to Hume) | Summary

## Summary

### Book 3, Part 1, Chapter 16: Berkeley

George Berkeley denied the existence of matter, maintaining that "material objects only exist through being perceived." To explain why objects do not disappear when people stop perceiving them, he answered that God is always perceiving everything, which keeps them in the world, so to say. Berkeley, who was an empiricist like [John Locke](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#John_Locke), wanted to correct what he thought were errors in his work. Locke's theory of knowledge claimed there are primary and secondary qualities. Primary qualities inhere in objects (for example, solidity, motion, rest, and number), while secondary qualities, such as color, sound, and the like are in the person who perceives. For example, it would not be possible to see color without eyes. Berkeley set out to prove that both primary and secondary qualities exist in the mind. People do not perceive material things, but rather only qualities, and these qualities are mental, Berkeley argues. The perception of them as things comes later, after perceived qualities are grouped and named.

[Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) looks closely at Berkeley's claims, using logic to show where he falls into fallacy in both his logical and empirical arguments. Russell agrees that things or phenomena are "bundles of sensible qualities" (for example, a table has hardness, a square shape, and so forth). But it is "a complete mistake" to say that only minds and mental events exist. To say there was a time on earth before life existed, for example, whether true or false, is not logically incorrect, any more than it is to say that there are multiplication problems that no one has worked out. An observed perception has an effect, as Berkeley pointed out—and Russell agrees. But logic does not dictate that all events should have effects (meaning phenomena can and do exist outside the realm of individual perception). Furthermore, according to Berkeley's idealism, a proposition that cannot be verified through individual perception is meaningless. Such a radical view "would forbid us to speak about anything that we have not ourselves explicitly noticed," and this is a serious defect in the theory on practical grounds.

### Book 3, Part 1, Chapter 17: Hume

[David Hume](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#David_Hume) was among the most important philosophers for taking the empiricism of Locke and Berkeley to its logical conclusion. He created a "dead end" in philosophy, and "in his direction, it is impossible to go further," says Russell. In Hume's most important work, the _Treatise of Human Nature_, he outlines a program of radical skepticism. First, Hume makes a distinction between impressions and simple ideas, saying the ideas are "faint images" of more forceful impressions (sensory data). (Complex ideas resemble impressions.) Russell faults Hume for saying simple ideas derive from impressions that "_exactly_ represent" them, since this is clearly not true from a psychological perspective. Hume then banishes "the conception of substance from psychology," saying there is "no _impression_ of self, and therefore no idea of self." The self can become part of knowledge only as "a bundle of perceptions," which negates knowledge of the soul along with the existence of substance.

His most important conclusion, however, is that cause-and-effect relationships based on inductive reasoning cannot be proven. More specifically, a person cannot know if one thing will cause another in the future, even if they observe this seeming connection in their experience of remembering the past. Just because a person notices many instances in which one phenomenon causes another—for example, every time they bite into an apple it has a certain sweet taste that cannot be confused with roast beef—there is no guarantee that this seeming cause-and-effect relationship will be repeated the next time. "The supposition, that the future resembles the past, is not founded on arguments of any kind, but is derived entirely from habit," says Hume.

Russell faults Hume for being insincere since he cannot maintain his radical skepticism in practice, as is evident in his moralizing in other parts of the treatise. Still, it is not possible to refute his arguments, and not surprisingly "a self-refutation of rationality" is followed by an embrace of irrationality in the likes of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Arthur Schopenhauer, and [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Friedrich_Nietzsche). "Hume's skepticism rests entirely upon his rejection of the principle of induction," says Russell. In his view Hume has proved that "pure empiricism" is not a sufficient basis to do science. Moreover, induction is "an independent logical principle, incapable of being inferred either from experience or from other logical principles." Yet without induction no science is possible.

## Analysis

George Berkeley is classified as an empiricist philosopher, which may be confusing since he denies the existence of matter independent of a perceiver. This is because Berkeley was an idealist—meaning he holds the view that reality is made up only of minds and their ideas. His philosophy is a kind of metaphysics based on perception and sensory data. Berkeley liked Locke's philosophy and wanted to iron out its errors and inconsistencies while keeping Locke's major tenets intact. While Berkeley believed all that people can know must come in through their sensory apparatus, he says what they perceive are mental qualities and not objects.

[David Hume](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#David_Hume) completed the empiricist project, and his radical skepticism has been likened to a wrecking ball by which he destroyed both philosophy and science. It would remain for those who followed him, particularly Immanuel Kant, to save philosophy from Hume's demolition project.

While [Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) stresses Hume's debunking of induction as an "independent, logical principle," his skepticism starts further back, and it may be helpful to trace Hume's skepticism and further explicate his logic. Hume began with Leibniz's distinctions between relations of ideas (analytic propositions) and matters of fact (synthetic propositions).

Analytic propositions are mere tautologies, or verbal truths that provide no information beyond the meaning of the words. An example of a tautology is "all elected officials are elected." Analytic propositions will lead to a self-contradiction when negated, are based on _a priori_ (prior to experience) knowledge, and are true by definition.

Synthetic propositions can be negated without leading to a self-contraction. For example, the statement "Most of the women in New York City are single" is an example of a synthetic proposition. Such a statement is based on _a posteriori_ knowledge (knowledge gained after experience) and is not necessarily true by definition. These two distinctions can be used to test whether a statement can be empirically proven. Only synthetic propositions have the potential to be proven.

"Hume's fork," the analytic-synthetic test, when applied to causality, has the result of revealing that the notion of causality is not grounded in experience. To say that when Ball A strikes Ball B, Ball B will move, is _not_ basing that assumption on _a posteriori_ knowledge, but rather simply expressing an expectation based on what has happened in the past but which cannot be said with certainty will happen in the future. To predict that the ball will move every time it is struck is to use inductive reasoning, but no one can know for sure it will move unless they can somehow observe it moving before it is struck, which would be impossible.

Russell faults Hume for being insincere for not retaining his radical skepticism in practice, but this is a weak argument, since what people know intellectually is often divorced from—sometimes by necessity—what they do in practice. For example, people know they are bound to die, and yet they act as if they are immortal and have unlimited time to waste and behave foolishly. Hume himself admitted that once he put his pen down and stopped thinking about philosophy, it would be inevitable for him to act like the rest of humanity and maintain the false notions of self, world, and causality.

# Book 3, Part 2, Chapters 18–19 : Modern Philosophy (From Rousseau to the Present Day) | Summary

## Summary

### Book 3, Part 2, Chapter 18: The Romantic Movement

Beginning in the late 18th century, a sensibility associated with the Romantic movement has influenced art, literature, philosophy, and even politics, even up to the current era. The first great figure of the movement is Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who embodied already existing tendencies. Romanticism follows the Restoration period after the French Revolution and the age of Napoleon. The 19th-century Romantic revolted against progress and capitalist values. However, the Romantic revolt was unlike the Marxist and Socialist revolt against monarchy and aristocracy and the mistreatment of the working class. A Romantic may shed copious tears for an oppressed mother or her ragged child, but never will they actually _do something_ to change the social system. The Romantics were individualists with very little social conscience. They scorned society and felt nostalgia for the classic and medieval ages of their imaginative fancies. Their moral values are primarily based on aesthetics.

[Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) notes the Romantic temperament is best studied in the fiction of the period. One archetypical exemplar of the Romantic being is the monster in Mary Shelley's _Frankenstein_. A misfit created by science, the monster begins as a gentle soul longing for human affection and contact. When he is rejected because of his ghastly appearance, he goes on a killing spree. Still, his sentiments remain "noble" from a Romantic perspective, as he laments his loneliness and moral destruction. Russell criticizes the Romantic project. Like the mystic, the Romantic separates himself from society, following the instinct of solitude and individuation. But while the mystic becomes one with God, the Romantic as "anarchic rebel" feels himself to be God with no obligations to others. A consummate egotist, he demands slavish love, and his own love turns to hatred when he comes up against the egos of others. The Romantics preferred relations with those who are like themselves—blood relations and people of the same tribe. Russell associates Romanticism with strong feelings of tribalism, which translates into nationalism and racism, particularly anti-Semitism. "Man is not a solitary animal," says Russell, "and so long as social life survives, self-realization cannot be the supreme principle of ethics."

### Book 3, Part 2, Chapter 19: Rousseau

Although not strictly a philosopher, Jean-Jacques Rousseau had a powerful influence on philosophy, literature, culture, and politics. His attractiveness came from his "appeal to the heart," or what may be called sensibility. Rousseau was educated in Geneva as an orthodox Calvinist (Protestant who believes in a strict moral code and predestination) but from an early age turned his back on convention to live a wandering, disheveled life. His antics, recorded in his biography _Confessions_, show how he used people and tricked them for his own advantage. Rousseau first came to public notice when he won a literary prize for an essay on the negative effects of science on society. In a second essay he held that "man is naturally good, and only by institutions is he made bad." He counseled abandoning civilization. Rousseau eventually met Voltaire, and before long they became bitter enemies—with Rousseau initiating the quarrel between them. Rousseau got into trouble with the authorities in Geneva in 1762 when he published _Emile_ (a treatise on natural education) and _The Social Contract_, which appeared to advocate democracy and deny the divine right of kings. Rousseau was forced to flee to France and then England.

Rousseau was important for creating an innovation in religious belief that continues to this day. Specifically, unlike the philosophers and religious people of previous times who believed in God and offered intellectual proofs, Rousseau based his belief in God on his feelings. Modern Protestants "base their faith upon some aspect of human nature—emotions of awe or mystery, the sense of right and wrong, the feeling of aspiration, and so on," says Russell. Rousseau's natural religion, which got him into so much hot water, had no need of revelation. Further, the vicar in _Emile_ does not believe in exclusive salvation for only one church or religion, and he doesn't believe in everlasting hell.

In _The_ _Social Contract_ Rousseau offers up a pastiche of political and philosophical ideas along with some idealized history of the Greek city-state. The contract Rousseau imagines borrows from Hume's _Leviathan_, since the citizens hand their freedom over to the state, in the form of the "Sovereign." This is "the community in its collective and legislative capacity," which is something of a "metaphysical entity, not fully embodied in any of the visible organs of the State." The Sovereign's will is always right, since it is the "general will," and those who refuse to obey "will be forced to be free." Rousseau imagines a direct democracy, following the ancient Greek model. But such a democracy is impossible since people cannot continually assemble and occupy themselves with public policy. _The Social Contract_ became the playbook of the French Revolution, says Russell, although it was not carefully read or understood. The idea of the _general will_ makes it possible to elevate a charismatic autocrat—as can be seen not only in Revolutionary France but also in Russia and Germany of the 1940s. "What further triumphs the future has to offer to [Rousseau's] ghost I do not venture to predict," says Russell.

## Analysis

A major theme in [Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/)'s _A History of Western Philosophy_ is that Romanticism is the foundational philosophy for subsequent ideas that justify totalitarian states. He specifically says, "The romantic revolt passes from Byron, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche to Mussolini and Hitler." He sees Nazi Germany naturally growing out of the ideas of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Friedrich_Nietzsche). While he doesn't lay the blame for Joseph Stalin's totalitarianism at the door of Romanticism, he claims the "hard-headed" school of liberalism can be traced from utilitarian philosophers and Karl Marx to the Soviet Union's dictator Joseph Stalin, although he does say his statement might be "too schematic to be quite true." Certainly revolutionaries used the ideas of Karl Marx in conceptualizing a Russian revolt against the aristocracy, but Marx envisioned his proletarian revolution as occurring in a democratic, industrialized nation. Thus Soviet communism was a far cry from the state that Marx had in mind.

Russell's sweeping generalizations about how certain philosophies have affected history seem to hold some truth—and they have been taken seriously by thinkers who came behind Russell—but on the other hand they seem to be somewhat glib and reductionist, particularly the view that Romanticism indirectly inspired the fascism of Hitler and Mussolini. Russell himself warns the reader in his chapter on Philosophical Liberalism (Book 3, Part 1, Chapter 12) about overestimating the influence of the philosopher. Moreover, when a political movement claims inspiration from a certain philosopher, not infrequently the philosopher becomes merely a representation of what the movement or party would have done anyway.

Russell argues that Romanticism is partially a reaction to the ennui (boredom; weariness) that affected Europe after the bloody French Revolution (actually a series of revolts), followed by the reign of Napoleon Bonaparte, and then followed by the Restoration of the French monarchy. Napoleon, a French autocrat with republican pretentions, successfully conquered most of Europe until he was first stopped by the Russian winter in 1812 and later defeated for good at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. Some Romantics were enamored of his larger-than-life figure, which was more exciting than that of the capitalist mogul. Russell uses literature to illustrate the Romantic temperament. While he mentions several authors, his example of Mary Shelley's _Frankenstein_ is a good instance of how Russell shapes the facts to suit his overreaching thesis. He incorrectly identifies the Creature (the monster) as the Romantic hero of the novel, when in fact the Romantic antihero is Victor Frankenstein, his creator. Far from being a paean to Romantic aspirations, Shelley's novel is a cautionary tale about the consequences of Romantic hubris and the bad results that occur when man puts himself on the level of God. Victor Frankenstein takes no responsibility for his monstrous creation and allows the Creature to kill several people, including the people who are nearest and dearest to him, without reporting his perverse experiment. Thus, another way of looking at the Romantic movement is that it has two sides: one glorifies the anarchic rebel who is the natural by-product of freer societies that allow for more individuation, but the other sees the danger in too much freedom, especially when coupled with advances in science and technology that have wider consequences for society as a whole.

Rousseau is identified by Russell as the first Romantic before Romanticism became a movement in the 19th century. Rousseau is contemporaneous with Voltaire, the French Enlightenment philosopher whose liberal ideas intersected with some Romantic notions. Russell claims the French Revolution, which took place between 1789 and 1799, relied heavily on Rousseau's philosophy in _The Social Contract_. While it is certainly true French revolutionaries justified their actions by quoting Enlightenment philosophers, the Revolution was mostly caused by the burdensome taxation of the middle class following the French involvement in the American Revolution. Furthermore, increases in bread prices along with bad harvests led to massive food shortages among the populace. Thus, economic conditions rather than Rousseau's "general will" likely elevated the revolutionary autocrats of France.

# Book 3, Part 2, Chapter 20 : Modern Philosophy (From Rousseau to the Present Day) | Summary

## Summary

In Chapter 20, titled "Kant," [Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) reviews how [David Hume](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#David_Hume)'s philosophy, which carried empiricism to its radical conclusion, demolished the concept of the Self and cast doubt on induction and causation. In Germany a new kind of philosophy developed to "safeguard both knowledge and virtue from the subversive doctrines of the late eighteenth century," says Russell. The first and most important philosopher in this mold is the German idealist Immanuel Kant. Russell believes Kant has been given too much credit as the "greatest of modern philosophers," although he does acknowledge his importance.

Kant's seminal work was _The Critique of Pure Reason_, whose purpose is to prove knowledge is in part _a priori_, or prior to experience, as opposed to only a _posteriori_, a result of observation or experience. The part of knowledge Kant considers _a priori_ includes logic as well as his _categories_. Kant accepts Hume's distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions—or the relationships among ideas versus matters of fact. _A priori_ analytic "facts" are merely verbal truths (for example, God exists), while _a posteriori_ synthetic facts are based on sense impressions (for example, it's raining outside). Kant parts company with Hume, however, in asserting that _a priori_ analytic facts exist.

An _a priori_ proposition "may be elicited by experience," but its basis is not experience. Russell notes, for example, that all pure mathematical propositions are _a priori_, in the sense that they no longer need confirmation once a mathematical concept is grasped: "Hume had proved that the law of causality is not analytic [and not _a priori_], and had inferred that we could not be certain of its truth." Kant agrees that the law of causality is synthetic (that is, each instance of cause and effect is observable), but he says, nonetheless, that causality is known _a priori_. In Kant's view the outer world causes "the matter of sensation," but the "mental apparatus" of a human being "orders this matter in space and time, and supplies the concepts by means of which we understand experience." Human beings cannot know the "things in themselves" (also called _noumena_) that cause experience. Rather, they are known through space and time, which are part of the mental apparatus. _Things in themselves_ are _inferred_ through the categories, or _a priori_ concepts, which exist in the mind—for example, unity, plurality, and totality. Kant specifies 12 categories. Those things people can know directly, what appears in perception, he calls _phenomena_. Kant says fallacies arise because people apply space and time or the categories to things not in experience. One example would be that God exists. Kant goes to great lengths to show the fallacy of intellectual proofs of God. Such ideas as God, freedom, and immortality are the products of reason but cannot be proved. Nonetheless, such ideas are practical and have a moral purpose.

"All moral concepts ... have their seat and origin wholly _a priori_ in the reason" in Kant's philosophy. Thus, a true moral act cannot be based in compassion, for example, but must be based in an internal sense of duty. The command of the reason is called an _imperative_. _Hypothetical imperatives_ demand that if a person does _x_ it will have _y_ outcome. _Categorical imperatives_ demand that a certain action "is objectively necessary, without regard to any end." Kant equates the categorical imperative with natural law. For example, people know murder is wrong because if everyone committed murder, no one on the planet could survive. Russell quibbles with Kant's logic in this regard, and he goes on to critique Kant's theory of space and time.

Russell summarizes Kant's ideas about space and time, which he says are the most important part of his doctrine. Russell faults Kant for a serious contradiction in the frame of his philosophy: space and time are rendered as both subjective and objective. On the one hand, space and time are said to exist _a priori_ in the mind as a construct, and on the other hand they must necessarily exist as a component of "things in themselves," which cause perceptions: the _noumena_, which are inherently beyond human experience. It is like saying the world without people in it possesses a spatiotemporal element, and yet to perceive through a spatiotemporal element (space and time) is an inherent quality of the mind. Hence, Kant creates a logical contradiction, since causality is both _a priori_ and _a posteriori_ in his philosophy. Russell concludes that Kant's percepts (objects of perception) caused by "things in themselves" or "events in the world of physics" are "by no means logically necessary." If a "thing in itself" is abandoned as a concept, then objects of perception lose their subjectivity. In fact, German philosophers who came after Kant dispensed with this idea: some of them went in the direction of empiricism, while others became absolutist, carrying subjectivity to the extreme.

## Analysis

It is necessary to understand that Immanuel Kant wrote his most important philosophical text in late middle age, after [David Hume](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#David_Hume)'s philosophy "awakened him from his dogmatic slumbers." Also important to keep in mind when reading [Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/)'s critique of Kant is that it is highly biased, and his assessment of Kant as overrated has not stood the test of time. For example, the _Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy_ says Kant is the central figure in modern philosophy. "He synthesized early modern rationalism and empiricism, set the terms for much of nineteenth and twentieth century philosophy, and continues to exercise a significant influence today in metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, political philosophy, aesthetics, and other fields," according to _Stanford_. Moreover, some philosophers of science say elements of Kant's philosophy can be correlated with certain ideas in Einsteinian physics and quantum mechanics. Be that as it may, Kant is most immediately concerned with saving philosophy from Hume's attack on inductive reasoning.

Kant's philosophy retrieves the validity of inductive reasoning by first accepting Hume's analytic-synthetic fork. Propositions are analytic (ideas about ideas _or_ ideas about unverified suppositions or verbal definitions) or synthetic (ideas about facts that have been verified through sense perception). Russell explains the distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions by saying an analytic proposition is one in which "the predicate is part of the subject." In philosophical parlance, _subjects_ refer to the subject or thing under discussion while the _predicate_ describes or characterizes the subject. Russell gives the example of an analytic proposition: "a tall man is a man." A synthetic proposition, however, which is empirical and based on sense perception, might be "Napoleon was a great tactician." An empirical, synthetic proposition is known either through perception or from testimony by others accepted as valid. All synthetic propositions can be proven by referring back to sensory experience, while analytic propositions cannot be proven with data.

Now Kant adds a third category of _a priori_ (before experience) facts existing by virtue of the faculty of reason. Space and time exist _a priori_ in the mind, along with 12 categories, of which causality is one. This is why a person can know ahead of time that when Ball A strikes Ball B, Ball B will move. Space and time are also part of the external world, however, along with causality, as _noumena_ or "things in themselves" that excite perceptions. Kant's view that time, space, and causality are both _a priori_ and _a posteriori_ (both in the mind and in the world) is seen by Russell as a logical contradiction. According the _Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy_, there is still no consensus among philosophers concerning whether Kant's response to Hume is successful or even what a better response might be. Some philosophers even argue that Hume's and Kant's notions of causality are not significantly different.

## Summary

### Book 3, Part 2, Chapter 21: Currents of Thought in the Nineteenth Century

"The intellectual life of the nineteenth century was more complex than that of any previous age," says [Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/). First, the known world had become larger, with other countries making contributions to culture. Second, science moved forward quickly with new discoveries. Third, technology radically altered the social structure and "gave men a new conception of their powers in relation to the physical environment." Fourth, political and philosophical revolt against traditional systems of thought "gave rise to attacks upon many beliefs and institutions that had hitherto been regarded as unassailable."

The revolt against tradition takes two forms—one Romantic and the other rationalistic, to use these words in their broadest sense: "The romantic revolt passes from Byron, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche to Mussolini and Hitler." The rationalistic revolt starts with the philosophers of the French Revolution and softens when it gets to England. Karl Marx is the deepest expression of this revolt, which passes to what will become Soviet Russia. A new factor in European thought is the "intellectual predominance of Germany," beginning with Immanuel Kant, who gives rise to the idealistic philosophy of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Both men are heirs to the rationalist tradition.

Two French philosophers who combine "rationalism and enthusiasm" [i.e., Romanticism] are Claude Adrien Helvétius (1715–71) and Nicolas de Condorcet (1743–94). Helvétius followed [John Locke](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#John_Locke)'s theory that the mind is a tabula rasa (blank slate) at birth and that differences among individuals are due to education. Condorcet held similar opinions, although he is more influenced by Jean-Jacques Rousseau. He believed in the rights of man and equal rights for women. In England the ideas of French revolutionary philosophers gave rise to Jeremy Bentham, a utilitarian philosopher who adopted the idea that "the greatest happiness of the greatest number" should be the guiding principle of society. The philosophers who followed Bentham were more focused on economics, and they were less radical than the Socialists who congealed around the philosophy of Karl Marx. The Romantic rebellion emphasized the will "at the expense of the intellect" and aligns itself with nationalism.

With regard to science, Charles Darwin (1809–82) was the key figure. While the idea that life evolves gradually from a common source was not new, Darwin supplied a great deal of scientific evidence. His idea of "survival of the fittest"—that evolution favors those who adapt and survive—was new. Darwin contended that survival of the fittest can account for "the whole long development [of life] from the protozoa to _homo sapiens_." His theory had the effect of emphasizing biological differences among people and thus undercutting the liberal idea that people are equal at birth. Nonetheless, evolution supports the liberal belief in progress. In politics Darwinism led to an emphasis on community, and "survival of the fittest" was applied to both individuals and nations.

Technology's effect on thinking was to give intellectuals a greater sense of human power. This has been a continual movement of history from the earliest days of civilization. But Russell notes that nowadays "an inconvenient mountain can be abolished and a convenient waterfall can be created." The desert can bloom, and the fertile plains can be turned into deserts. Now state authority replaced Church authority and could transform the mentality of a population in a generation through universal education. "To frame a philosophy capable of coping with men intoxicated with the prospect of almost unlimited power and also with the apathy of the powerless is the most pressing task of our time," says Russell.

### Book 3, Part 2, Chapter 22: Hegel

Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's ideas grew out of a movement in German philosophy that began with Kant. Hegel's influence was wide in the 19th century, both in the United States and Great Britain, and his philosophy of history "profoundly affected political theory." Karl Marx borrows ideas from Hegel's philosophy, for example. Nonetheless, Bertrand Russell asserts that "almost all Hegel's doctrines are false."

In Hegel's philosophy the rational is real and the real is rational, although he doesn't mean "real" in the same way an empiricist would use the term. For Hegel the empiricist's "facts" are irrational until they are transformed into aspects of the whole. Such a view, according to Bertrand Russell, leads to the notion that "whatever is, is right." In Hegel's metaphysical view the whole is called the Absolute and is spiritual. But he differs from other metaphysical philosophers in his emphasis on logic, which he believes is the same as metaphysics (a view to which Russell strongly objects).

Hegel believes "the nature of Reality can be deduced from the sole consideration that it must be not self-contradictory." Any description of reality is self-contradictory, because as soon as a person says something specific about reality, they leave out an infinite number of things related to that description, which makes it incomplete. For example, if the philosopher says John is an uncle, he has not said that Bob is John's nephew, nor that John has a sister, nor that he and his sister have parents, and so on and so forth. "Since everything, except the Whole, has relations to outside things, it follows that nothing quite true can be said about separate things, and that in fact only the Whole is real," explains Russell.

Another important aspect of understanding reality is the dialectic, which can be seen in the following: First, he presents the thesis that "the Absolute is Pure Being," but an absolute without qualities is nothing. This requires an antithesis that "the Absolute is Nothing." These two are then synthesized in the union of being and nonbeing, which is "becoming." Thus the synthesis is "the Absolute is Becoming." This dialectic is used to reach greater and greater truth in Hegel's system, in which self-consciousness is the highest form of knowledge. For the Absolute, which possesses the highest knowledge, "there is nothing outside itself for it to know."

Hegel applies his dialectic to history, with the idea that history is advancing from less to more perfect, both ethically and logically. For example, a society might encompass a small number of free citizens and a large number of slaves (thesis and antithesis), and in the next iteration of history, those opposites are synthesized in a society that is feudalistic. Slavery _per se_ is abolished, and a greater number of people have partial freedom. In the next iteration feudalism will face an antithesis to create a new synthesis. This movement of history is continuous.

Russell's strong objections to Hegelian philosophy are based in Hegel's ultimate glorification of an essentially totalitarian state. For Hegel the essence of spirit is freedom. He then traces the development of spirit through three historical phases of "the Orientals, the Greeks and Romans, and the Germans," saying the Germans are "the spirit of the new world." The aim of this new world is "the realization of absolute Truth as the unlimited self-determination of freedom—_that_ freedom which has its own absolute from itself as its purport." Freedom for Hegel is the freedom to obey the law, in a state "which has its own absolute from itself." Hegel glorifies the German state, beginning with the Reformation, and gives it "a sacred character." He claims the state "is the actually existing realized moral life," and that any spiritual reality a person possesses comes through the state. Truth is the unity of universal and individual will, says Hegel, and the universal will is found "in the State, in its laws, its universal and rational arrangements." He goes as far as saying "the State is the Divine Idea as it exists on earth" and "the embodiment of rational freedom."

Such a doctrine in Russell's view "justifies every internal tyranny and every external aggression that can possibly be imagined." Moreover Hegel violates his own metaphysics and so-called logic. This is because he sees more excellence in wholes than parts, which leads Hegel to prefer a state over "an anarchic collection of individuals." But when it comes to states, he doesn't prefer a world state, but rather "an anarchic collection of States." He strongly argues against the idea of a world government and provides a moral justification for war, claiming it preserves "the moral health of peoples ... in their indifference towards the stabilizing of finite determinations"—that is, they'd rather kill and die than be subject to a "finite" stabilizing world authority.

Russell ends his discussion of Hegel by demolishing the logic behind these assertions: (1) the whole is _always_ better than its parts and (2) it is possible to infer all properties of a thing by knowing enough about it to distinguish it from other things. Russell ends by sarcastically noting, "The worse your logic, the more interesting the consequences to which it gives rise."

## Analysis

[Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) speaks about two 19th-century revolts in the history of ideas: the Romantic revolt, which he has already discussed at length in Book 3, Part 2, Chapters 18 and 19, and the rationalist revolt. Russell is not using the term _rationalist_ in the usual sense for philosophers—as when they compare rationalist and empiricist thinkers. When Russell talks about rationalistic philosophers, he means to say either that the philosopher is scientific, practical, or reasonable or he ascribes some form of liberal philosophy to them.

Russell traces a line from Byron to Hitler in discussing the first revolt (Romantic), and a line from the French Enlightenment philosophers to the Soviet Union, with Karl Marx in between, to discuss the second revolt (rationalistic). This is somewhat contradictory to what he has said previously about Jean-Jacques Rousseau, since he puts him in the Romantic camp in a previous chapter. Yet Rousseau is generally classified as an Enlightenment philosopher.

Russell also throws into the mix the German idealists, beginning with Kant, who reflect a new ascendancy of German philosophers. Throughout his history Russell is trying to make sense of the rise of Hitler's fascist state in Germany, and now he is thinking about why the German philosophers developed as they did. Russell opines that German idealism after Kant is "profoundly influenced by German history; much of what seems strange in German philosophical speculation reflects the state of mind of a vigorous nation deprived, by historical accidents, of its natural share of power."

This chapter is somewhat disorganized. After Russell gets sidetracked with two philosophers who appear to be hybrids of the Romantic and rationalistic impulses, he jumps to the English utilitarians and then to Darwin. Probably the most important idea to take away from this chapter is his assertion that the Romantic rebellion emphasizes the will and aligns itself with nationalism, a thread he picks up again in his discussion of Hegel, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche.

In his discussion of Charles Darwin Russell mentions how his theory of evolution and _survival of the fittest_ emphasize biological differences among people, thus undercutting ideas of equality at birth. But he never mentions how Darwin's idea of survival of the fittest jumped disciplines and became Social Darwinism, primarily through the writings of Herbert Spencer, a 19th-century English philosopher and sociologist. Spencer applied Darwin's idea for the purpose of showing that societies evolved in the same way as species do. Spencer's ideas were hijacked to justify classism and laissez-faire capitalism, which advocates for a freewheeling capitalism that operates without any checks and balances. Granted Spencer is not a major philosopher, but the idea of Social Darwinism affected history and philosophy as least as much as the ideas spouted by Lord Byron, who gets his own chapter in Russell's book. Spencer also subscribed to Lamarckism, the idea first introduced by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, that acquired characteristics in a species can be inherited by subsequent generations. This is another important idea that affected philosophy, but Russell doesn't give it even a sentence.

When Russell gets to Hegel in Chapter 22, he can't say enough bad things about his philosophy. Russell includes Hegel in his survey because his influence throughout the 19th century is profound. While he mentions that Hegel often criticizes Immanuel Kant yet couldn't have existed without him, he does not explain that the post-Kantian philosophers are troubled by Kant's definition of reality as _noumena_, or things in themselves, which are inaccessible to human thought, although the mind perceives them through Kant's categories. But the German idealists who follow Kant are not satisfied with this idea—that ultimately _noumena_ cannot be known. While Russell has already consigned Hegel more or less to the dustbin of philosophical history in 1943, in fact Hegel is called a "philosophical giant" and "modern [Aristotle](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Aristotle)" by American philosopher Tom Rockmore. Russell discusses the political philosophy found in Hegel's fourth book of philosophy, called _Philosophy of Right_ (1821), which Rockmore admits was highly controversial. "Some ... see it as a sober and realistic analysis. Others, particularly Marxists, consider its author a reactionary pillar of the Prussian state of his time"—an idea Russell agrees with.

Once again Russell pulls out his Occam's razor along with the scalpel of logicism to deconstruct what he dislikes. Russell begins with the infamous quote attributed to Hegel that "whatever is, is right." However, philosopher and translator Walter Kaufmann has pointed out that a mistranslation ended up boiling Hegel's view down to this sound bite. In fact, what Hegel said, according to Kaufmann, is "it is the way of God in the world, that there should be a state," which is a lot less inflammatory. Russell next summarizes a bit of Hegel's metaphysics, which includes a concept of Absolute pure being, toward which the world and all self-conscious beings are moving. The movement of history, or the movement of the spirit through historical phases, must end in unlimited freedom. But in Hegel's view there can be no freedom without law, which is why an Absolute state is needed.

Russell understandably objects to such a view, but he could have pointed out that Hegel too was influenced by history—in this case by the French Revolution. Russell could have pointed out how Hegel was shaped by these turbulent times, so perhaps the chaos of that period accounted for the notion that a perfect state could sort out "an anarchic collection of individuals." It is understandable to see why Russell distrusts Hegel's philosophy, which easily can be used to justify all manner of abuses by the state. But it may have been fairer to Hegel to have included more aspects of his philosophy rather than just the political philosophy found in one book.

## Summary

### Book 3, Part 2, Chapter 23: Byron

George Gordon, Lord Byron needs reevaluation as someone who was influential on European thinking, more on the Continent than in the British Isles (he was an English gentleman). He represents the aristocratic rebel whose criticism of society sometimes takes the form of "Titanic cosmic self-assertion, or, in those who retain some superstition, of Satanism." Bryon is an exemplar of both types of rebel in [Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/)'s view. "The aristocratic philosophy of rebellion ... has inspired a long series of revolutionary movements," until Adolf Hitler's "_coup_ in 1933."

Russell covers Byron's biography to show how he was shaped by his difficult early life and his sudden inheritance of wealth and title. Byron admired Napoleon Bonaparte as an exemplar of a Romantic hero and was sorry to hear he finally lost to the English at Waterloo. In Germany Napoleon is admired by some as "the mighty missionary of liberalism" and by others as the "Antichrist, but an Antichrist to be imitated, not merely to be abhorred." In Russell's view "nationalism, Satanism, and hero-worship, the legacy of Byron, became part of the complex soul of Germany."

### Book 3, Part 2, Chapter 24: Schopenhauer

Arthur Schopenhauer was a pessimist, unlike the majority of Western philosophers. He disliked Christianity and embraced the philosophies of Eastern religion, particularly Buddhism and Hinduism, acknowledging Immanuel Kant, [Plato](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Plato), and the Upanishads (Hindu philosophical texts) as the sources of his philosophy. Schopenhauer adapted elements of Kant's philosophy, particularly his idea of a _thing in itself_, which becomes _will_ in Schopenhauer's system. Will is behind all phenomena and is not found in time or space since it is not a plurality. Schopenhauer sees this cosmic will as wicked—the source of endless suffering, which is increased with knowledge. Happiness is not possible, since unfulfilled wishes cause pain and fulfillment of desire "brings only satiety." In Schopenhauer's view shame is associated with sex because while people instinctively wish to procreate, they are simply bringing to fruition new occasions for suffering and death.

If people do not wish to suffer, the best thing they can do is attenuate their will or cultivate a state of being without desire. The distinction between one person and another is an illusion of the phenomenal world (Maya), and the good person "reaches this insight by love, which is always sympathy, and has to do with the pain of others." When the "veil of Maya is lifted, a man takes on the suffering of the whole world." This helps to quiet the will. The philosopher feels "a horror of the nature of which his own phenomenal existence is an expression," in Schopenhauer's words, and turns away from life. He declares Buddhism the highest religion, although he finds value in the Christian doctrine of original sin. The good person practices asceticism not to achieve harmony with God, as do the Western mystics, or to be reabsorbed "into Brahma" or "Nirvana" as do the Eastern mystics. Rather, Schopenhauer's goal is to reduce oneself to nothing. Russell points out that Schopenhauer does not clearly explain what he means by coming "as near as possible to non-existence." Russell also points out that this philosophy is not the same as the "Beatific Vision" sought by the mystics, since Schopenhauer has more or less replaced God with Satan (in a metaphorical sense) as the omnipotent will.

### Book 3, Part 2, Chapter 25: Nietzsche

Bertrand Russell finds [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Friedrich_Nietzsche), who saw himself as Arthur Schopenhauer's successor, to be more consistent and coherent. Russell says Nietzsche is important primarily in the field of ethics and as a historical critic. An exemplar of the Romantic strain in philosophy, he is in "conscious opposition to ... the dominant political and ethical trends of his time," and his political philosophy has much in common with Niccolò Machiavelli's _The Prince_.

Nietzsche admired qualities he believed were found only in an aristocratic minority. The majority of people should be the "means to the excellence of the few," and he is not concerned with their well being. For example, he says, "The [French] Revolution made Napoleon possible," and that is a good thing. _Beyond Good and Evil_, one of his seminal texts, has as its motive changing people's ideas about what is good and bad. "True virtue" is a characteristic of higher men, who should "make war upon the masses, and resist the democratic tendencies of the age," according to Russell's reading of Nietzsche. Nietzsche expects his higher man to have Spartan-like discipline and "the capacity to endure as well as inflict pain for important ends." The German philosopher "admires strength of will above all things." For him compassion is a weakness to be combated. "He wants an international ruling race, who are to be the lords of the earth," says Russell, heroes writ large in the mold of Napoleon.

Nietzsche hates Christianity because it accepts "slave morality," says Russell. Since Nietzsche doesn't believe any religion is true, he judges religions by their effects on society. For the masses of people submission should not be to God but to "artist-tyrants," except for the "supermen," who submit to nobody. Christianity has allied itself will the spirit of the French Revolution and socialism, which promotes equality among all men, which Nietzsche clearly does not support. He finds both Buddhism and Christianity to be nihilistic religions. Christianity is the worse of the two, being the champion of "the revolt of the bungled and botched."

"In place of the Christian saint Nietzsche wishes to see what he calls the 'noble man,'" or "governing aristocrat." The noble man recognizes duties only to men of his own rank but will protect all those who have mastered some skill (particularly artists and poets). Cruelty plays a role in "aristocratic excellence," and Russell quotes Nietzsche as saying, "Almost everything that we call 'higher culture' is based upon the spiritualizing and intensifying of _cruelty_." The noble man must be "the incarnate will to power."

In assessing Nietzsche's philosophy Russell provides psychological analysis, saying much of his philosophy should be "dismissed as merely megalomaniac." Nietzsche is fearful himself and "day-dreams he is a warrior, not a professor." His low opinion of women reflects his fear of them as well. He cannot imagine anyone feeling universal love because "he himself feels almost universal hatred and fear, which he would fain disguise as lordly indifference." He accuses Nietzsche of being partly responsible for the fact that the "real world has become very like his nightmare." No doubt Russell is referring to the horrors of World War II. At the end of the chapter Russell imagines a conversation between Nietzsche and the Buddha, saying he would agree with the Buddha as he has imagined him, although he can give no mathematical or scientific proof. His argument is an appeal to emotions: "Nietzsche despises universal love; I feel it the motive power to all that I desire as regards the world," he says.

## Analysis

It is difficult to account for [Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/)'s inclusion of a chapter on Lord Byron, the English poet, when he could just as easily have included him in his chapters on the Romantic Movement and/or the 19th century (Book 3, Part 2, Chapters 18 and 21). Clearly Byron is not a philosopher, and the main point Russell needs to get across is that the Byronic hero is an archetypal Lucifer who would rather rule in hell rather than bow down in heaven. Byron admires the world conqueror Napoleon Bonaparte, as does [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Friedrich_Nietzsche), but Napoleon is admired by many in the 19th century. It is a sad fact of life that people in any era "romanticize" successful, ruthless, and powerful heroes, even when they are on the wrong side of the law or the wrong side of history. And Napoleon was also admired for genuinely good things that he did—for example, instituting the Napoleonic code of law and spreading republican ideas, even if he was an autocrat. But Napoleon will come up again in the discussion of Nietzsche's philosophy; he is a symbol of the glorification of the autocratic ruler in Russell's text.

Arthur Schopenhauer takes ideas from Eastern spirituality and Kant's idea of the noumenal world, beyond direct perception, and melds them to create a manifestation of a malignant will. This demonic will is a kind of negative of the Indian idea of Brahman, or the One without a second, and in Schopenhauer's philosophy it is the opposite of fullness. Rather it is an insatiable yawning maw that can never be satisfied. Schopenhauer also borrows the Eastern idea that attachment or desire is the source of all suffering; the solution is to practice nonattachment and contentment. This idea is found in both Buddhism and Hinduism, from which Buddhism sprang. Schopenhauer declares Buddhism the highest religion because it dispenses with all ideas of divinity and boils the goal of life down to Nirvana, or extinguishment of personal self. Schopenhauer is a nihilist, and his vision of life has little in common with the Eastern mystics, as Russell points out.

When Russell turns to Friedrich Nietzsche, he correctly outlines the "letter" of his philosophy but misrepresents the spirit of it. Nietzsche is perhaps the most maligned of philosophers, called a Nazi and anti-Semite for years by people reading bad translations. Moreover, after Nietzsche's death, his anti-Semitic sister, who supported the Nazi cause, appropriated his works and even published unfinished works, leaving out portions that didn't suit her. She went as far as to forge documents and say they had been written by her brother and represented him as supporting her views. The Nazis appropriated certain ideas that were in Nietzsche's philosophy and could easily be misunderstood when taken out of context, especially because Nietzsche is such a dense and complex thinker and writer. Russell would have had access to Nietzsche in German since he was fluent in that language, and he doesn't misrepresent what Nietzsche says. But he leaves out other things that Nietzsche also says, so the effect of the whole is a misrepresentation. He seems less indignant with Nietzsche than some other philosophers, perhaps because he thinks he is mentally ill. He psychoanalyzes him, something he hasn't done with any other philosopher—calling him a megalomaniac and implying he is somewhat pathetic and deluded.

Russell is incorrect in saying that Nietzsche wanted to change people's ideas about what is good and bad. Rather, Nietzsche, like [Socrates](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Socrates), is the state's gadfly, and he is more interested in disrupting the status quo than in instituting a philosophical program or a state based on his philosophy. In _Beyond Good and Evil_ he attacks the prejudices of philosophers, as he says, and he forces them to examine the presuppositions underlying the beliefs that they hold. He argues that there is no such thing as objective morality, but only interpretation of acts according to an invented moral code or conceptual scheme. He shows how all human activity boils down to strategies for masking oneself behind a persona, and the true measure of a man can be taken when all masks have been stripped away.

Nietzsche took Schopenhauer's malevolent will and turned it into the "will to power," a universal human drive to thrive, expand, and conquer. This idea became an important psychological fact in the writings of Sigmund Freud. Certainly will to power can be directed for good or for ill, but it clearly exists. What is more, the sublime aspects of Nietzsche's philosophy address the turning of the will to power on oneself, to overcome and cross a metaphorical bridge and become the overman. Toward the end of _Beyond Good and Evil_ Nietzsche addresses a prose poem to the god Dionysus, "the genius of the heart," who, among other things, "smooths rough souls and lets them taste a new desire—to lie still as a mirror, that the deep sky may mirror itself in them." Nietzsche says he has learned from Dionysus and now wishes to offer his readers a taste of what he knows.

Russell diagnoses Nietzsche's neuroses, but he doesn't mention the physical pain he lived with his whole life, never complaining nor feeling sorry for himself. Russell often uses the bits of biography to put the philosophers he dislikes in the worst light. For example, he faults Schopenhauer for being a hedonist while espousing an austere philosophy. But do the facts of Schopenhauer's life change his philosophy? Russell is understandably outraged about Nazi genocide, but his accusation that Nietzsche is "partly responsible" for the fact the "real world has become ... his nightmare" is false and irresponsible. If Russell wants to hold artists and philosophers accountable for the misuse of their ideas, then the logical corollary of that is a vigorous program of state censorship in case an idea might cause some harm. Russell appears to consciously misrepresent Nietzsche—surprising in a brilliant mathematician and philosopher who had the benefit of reading Nietzsche in his original language. Second, Russell perhaps engages in his own hypocrisy by committing the cardinal philosopher's sin, which is to impose their own moral prejudices on philosophy in a desire to improve others. "Morally a philosopher who uses his professional competence for anything except a disinterested search for the truth is guilty of a kind of treachery," says Russell, and his own words indict him in his treatment of Nietzsche.

# Book 3, Part 2, Chapters 26–27 : Modern Philosophy (From Rousseau to the Present Day) | Summary

## Summary

### Book 3, Part 2, Chapter 26: The Utilitarians

The British philosophers of the 19th century were not much influenced by the Germans. Jeremy Bentham, the founder of the utilitarian movement, based his philosophy on the "association principle" and the "greatest happiness" principle. Bentham followed British philosopher David Hartley (1705–57) in recognizing association as a basic principle of psychology: ideas are associated with language, and ideas with ideas. The doctrine is similar to the behavioral theory of conditioning, in which A and B are associated in the mind and B produces a reaction C, but because of the association of A and B, A can produce C by itself. Thus, Bentham "aims at a deterministic account of mental occurrences." He is interested in establishing a social system that will "automatically make men virtuous," which is why he is interested in conditioned responses.

The second principle (greatest happiness) defines virtue: what is good is happiness or pleasure (he makes no distinction between these two terms), and what is bad is pain. Each person pursues what they believe will bring them happiness. In the best of all possible worlds, pleasure outweighs pain. While the utilitarian doctrine is not new, Bentham applies it to some practical problems.

Based on utilitarianism, the government should "produce harmony between public and private interests." Criminal law aligns the interests of the individual with those of the community. Punishment under the law is to prevent future crime, not to penalize the criminal. "Civil law ... should have four aims: subsistence, abundance, security, and equality." Bentham is less concerned with liberty than security. Bentham did believe in equality, however, which in later years led him to support complete democracy and women's right to vote. Based on his uncompromising rationality, he rejected both God and religion. The weakness in Bentham's system is that if every person pursues his or her own pleasure (happiness), how can the governing body "pursue the pleasure of mankind in general"? Russell opines that Bentham's blind spot is that he simply assumed others shared his "instinctive benevolence."

Russell finishes the chapter by briefly discussing Darwinism (the theory of evolution) and socialism, which preceded Karl Marx and was "a direct outcome of orthodox economics." David Ricardo (1772–1823) was a political economist who argued all value comes from labor. Based on this premise, Robert Owen (1771–1858) and his followers expanded this idea, arguing that all reward should be given to labor and what the landowner and capitalist receive off the backs of the laborers is "mere extortion."

### Book 3, Part 2, Chapter 27: Karl Marx

[Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) confines his discussion of Karl Marx to his philosophy (not his politics or economics) and his influence on the philosophy of others. Marx called himself a dialectical materialist (he was influenced by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's idea of the dialectic). For Marx sensation or perception involved an interaction between subject and object. The raw material of the object "is transformed in the process of becoming known." In the pursuit of knowledge "both the knower and the thing known ... are in a continual process of mutual adaptation," which Marx calls the _dialectical_ because it is never completed. The driving force of the world is matter, not spirit, in Marx's philosophy—or rather, "man's relation to matter, of which the most important part is his mode of production." Thus, Marx's materialism becomes economics in practice, Russell says. Moreover, "the politics, religion, philosophy, and art of any epoch in human history are, according to Marx, an outcome of its methods of production, and, to a lesser extent, of distribution." This doctrine is called "the materialist conception of history."

Russell admits he has been influenced by Marx in his views on the historical development of philosophy, although he does not accept Marx's thesis wholesale. Nonetheless, it has "important elements of truth." At the same time he points out that certain questions of philosophy—for example, the problem of universals—are influenced by biases that are perennial but have no direct connection to the social system. Further, certain aspects of philosophy are matters of fact (science) or logic, eventually resolved through general agreement. Other types of philosophical questions are of "passionate interest to large numbers of people" and are only partially determined by social and economic causes.

Marx "fitted his philosophy of history into a mold suggested by Hegelian dialectic" but was concerned with only three things: "feudalism, represented by the landowner; capitalism, represented by the industrial employer; and Socialism, represented by the wage-earner." As a philosopher he has "grave shortcomings," being "too practical, too much wrapped up in the problems of his time." Marx has had a large influence on history. In his own country his ideas inspired the Social Democrats prior to the rise of fascism. In Russia Marxists were running the government. Finally, many intellectuals in Great Britain and the United States have been influenced by his ideas.

## Analysis

When utilitarians say that "man desires his own happiness," it is both a truism and a false statement, according to [Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/). It is true because when a person desires something they get pleasure in achieving their wish. Thus, whatever they desire becomes a pleasure, and it can be loosely said that "pleasures are what I desire." However, this idea is false in that a person does not generally desire something because of the pleasure it will bring. For example, people desire food when they are hungry. Hunger is the desire; the pleasure is secondary. Most ordinary desires are prior to any "calculation of pleasures and pains." Moreover, people may desire anything, even pain, but in such cases "the pleasure is because of the desire, and not vice versa."

In correcting the utilitarian statements about whether man desires happiness, Russell is again applying his logic to tease out the linguistic errors that do not accurately represent reality. But a more interesting question to consider might be whether happiness and pleasure are equivalent, and whether people truly desire pleasure or something else. Or do they desire pleasure sometimes and something else they think is pleasure at other times? Russell also uses the example of people desiring something that does not affect them personally—for example, "general happiness, or a mitigation of general suffering"—as examples of how people do not always pursue personal pleasure. But he seems to be leaving out the genuine pleasure people experience from helping others in the form of satisfaction. Russell also provides the example of people who want everyone to belong to their religion—calling it a "non-egoistic desire." However, the desire to have other people belong to one's religion is an egotistical desire. A psychologist will argue people want other people to believe what they believe so that they can feel secure in their worldview and sustain the illusion that they have somehow gotten hold of "the truth." Therefore, it serves the individual to convert others to their belief system. To do so is also the exercise of their will to power.

Russell does not provide much on Karl Marx, since the main part of his doctrine is economic rather than philosophical. Nonetheless, it is important to include him because of his wide-ranging influence. Russell admits he believes Marx's basic theory: methods of production and distribution (essentially economic systems) profoundly affect political and cultural systems and determine the trajectory of history. Moreover, this view has affected his views of the historical development of philosophy, but he nonetheless points out some discrepancies in the Marxist explanation of why things happen as they happen.

Considering how scrupulously Russell monitors the language of other philosophers and points out syntactical errors, it is surprising that he would say that in Russia Marxists are running the country. In fact in 1943, Russia is not even under a Marxist-Leninist regime, as it was when the Communist state in Russia first came into existence. Rather, Russia is under Stalinism, which is quite a horse of another color. Also interesting is that Russell treats Marx gently, merely saying his philosophy has "grave shortcomings." He doesn't blame Marx for the excesses of the Russian totalitarian state the way he blames Nietzsche for German fascism. In 1943, when Russell is writing his text, the West perhaps did not know about the mass murders carried out by Stalin beginning in 1933. In fact, Stalin killed more people than Hitler did. Still Russell must have had some idea that Stalin was a psychopath, and certainly he knew a lot of people had died in the Russian Revolutions. His response to Marx as the originator of a philosophy that was (and still is) used for ill purposes is contradictory when compared to his treatment of Nietzsche and other German philosophers.

# Book 3, Part 2, Chapters 28–30 : Modern Philosophy (From Rousseau to the Present Day) | Summary

## Summary

### Book 3, Part 2, Chapter 28: Bergson

Henri Bergson (1859–1941) was a leading philosopher of the early the 20th century who influenced French philosophy, as well as the American philosopher Henry James and English philosopher and mathematician Alfred North Whitehead. Bergson's "irrationalism made a wide appeal quite unconnected with politics," explains Russell. He finds Bergson's philosophy difficult to classify and ends up classifying him with the pragmatists. Although Russell devotes several pages to Bergson, he has such a strong bias and antipathy toward him that the reader is doubtful whether he is fairly representing Bergson's views.

One central idea in Bergson's philosophy is the distinction between intuition and intellect. Intuition is "instinct at its best," which is "disinterested, self-conscious, capable of reflecting upon its object and of enlarging it indefinitely." Intelligence or intellect "can only form a clear idea of the discontinuous and immobile." Bergson connects solid bodies and intellect, seeming to say the mind creates them on purpose "to apply intellect to them." Because intellect separates things, it is "a kind of dream; it is not _active_ ... but purely contemplative."

"The two foundations of Bergson's philosophy ... are his doctrines of space and time," says Russell. He says Bergson condemns the intellect based on the doctrine of space. If his central doctrines are false, says Russell, then nothing remains in his philosophy that is credible. Russell then sets out to prove Bergson's theories are specious. He bases his criticisms primarily on what Bergson says about numbers and on how he uses minor errors and confusions in intellectual thought to support his anti-intellectual philosophy.

### Book 3, Part 2, Chapter 29: William James

William James is primarily a psychologist but also important as a philosopher for inventing "radical empiricism" and for being an exponent of pragmatism, also called instrumentalism. James's first foray into radical empiricism is in an essay titled "Does Consciousness Exist?" whose main purpose is to "deny that the subject-object relation is fundamental." The dualism in philosophy, of subject-object and mind and matter, needs to be reconsidered, in James's view. James calls consciousness a "nonentity" with no rights among "first principles." Russell explains that James is denying consciousness is a "thing" and rather thinks it is "primal stuff" out of which the world is made: "This stuff he calls 'pure experience.'" Knowing is the relationship between two parts of pure experience, and "the subject-object relation is derivative." James's view can be called "neutral monism."

_Pragmatism_ was published in 1907 and continued James's thinking along the same lines. In James's view the "function of philosophy is to find out what difference it makes to you or me if this or that world-formula is true." Ideas are true as much as they help people to get into "satisfactory relations with other parts of our experience." An idea is true if it is good for people's lives. With regard to religion, James says that if a person has a hypothesis about God that works for them, then it is true. Moreover, based on the proofs of religious experience, it may well be that higher powers are at work in the world. Russell disputes James's view that a belief is true simply because the effect is good, and he exposes the logical problems in what seems like a simple proposition. James is attempting to "build a superstructure of belief upon a foundation of skepticism, and like all such attempts it is dependent on fallacies," Russell says.

### Book 3, Part 2, Chapter 30: John Dewey

John Dewey was the leading living philosopher in the United States, according to [Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/), writing in 1943. Russell says Dewey had a profound influence on philosophy as well as education, aesthetics, and political theory. While Russell agrees with Dewey on many things, he feels "compelled to dissent from his most distinctive philosophical doctrine," in which he substitutes "inquiry" for "truth" as "the fundamental concept of logic and theory of knowledge."

Russell begins by saying something about his own idea of truth. He gives a few examples and concludes there is objectivity in truth and falsehood: "what is true (or false) is a state of the organism [person], but it is true (or false), in general, in virtue of occurrences outside the organism." What this means is that what a person considers to be true can be verified by external objective occurrences. Dewey, on the other hand, does not judge absolute truth or falsehood but prefers to carry on a process of inquiry to reach "mutual adjustment between an organism and its environment." In Dewey's philosophy truth is defined according to inquiry, not vice versa, and truth is the "the opinion which is fated to be ultimately agreed to by all who investigate." The problem with this theory is that it "severs" the relationship between a belief and fact(s) that would be called on to verify it.

Russell provides this example: a general makes preparations for a battle based on the intelligence reports he gets about what his enemy is doing on his side to prepare. The intelligence the general has received would be true if, indeed, these are the moves the enemy makes. Those facts would continue to be true even if the general ends up losing the battle. Dewey, however, would not know what to think about the intelligence reports until after the battle had taken place. The main difference between Dewey and Russell, then, is that Dewey "judges a belief by its effects, whereas [Russell judges] it by its causes where a past occurrence is concerned." Russell says Dewey's perspective is "in harmony with the age of industrialism and collective enterprise." This presumption is based on his idea that philosophers, like everyone else, are connected to and affected by their social environment, and Dewey lives in a country at the forefront of industrial and technological progress. In the end Russell is most concerned with the growing "cosmic impiety" of the modern age, in which truth is no longer dependent on facts largely outside of human control (which breeds humility in the philosopher). Now scientists can alter the environment and create new facts with technology, and Russell fears intoxication with power has invaded philosophy. Man's hubris [extreme pride] generally is the greatest danger of the current historical era.

## Analysis

[Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) concludes his summary of Bergson with an attempt to entirely discredit him. He sarcastically throws down a gauntlet to those who might take the philosopher seriously: "Those to whom activity without purpose seems a sufficient good will find in Bergson's books a pleasing picture of the universe," he says. However, those who believe action has value and must be inspired by a vision or hope of a world "less painful, less unjust" will find nothing of value in Bergson's philosophy. Russell appears to misunderstand key ideas in Bergson's philosophy, perhaps not entirely accidentally. He particularly disagrees with what Bergson says about numbers, and he objects to his characterizing intuition as a more effective tool than intellect for apprehending multiplicity.

According to the _Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy_, Bergson's influence waned considerably after World War II, but his work has lately awakened the interest of some philosophers who believe his concept of multiplicity, which attempts to unify heterogeneity (diversity) and continuity (unbroken existence or operation), is "revolutionary." Bergson sees the immediate data of consciousness as temporary and calls it the duration. In the duration events are not juxtaposed or put next to each other, side by side. Rather, in the duration there is qualitative multiplicity, which Bergson illustrates by referring to the experience of sympathy. Sympathy is a moral feeling, but it is inspired by a cluster of contradictory emotions, all occurring together and interpenetrating one another. Thus, sympathy is heterogeneous and continuous. Bergson connects duration with "mobility" and mobility with freedom. Duration exhibits itself in memory, and Russell disagrees with Bergson's definition of memory. For that reason he believes that what follows from Bergson's conception of memory (i.e., the duration) is also false.

Bergson argues that intuition, which occurs in the duration, is superior to intellect, an idea Russell cannot abide. Bergson sees intuition as a nonconceptual faculty focused on truth, which in science manifests as an original insight that gets covered over by concepts formulated after insight. Russell perhaps disingenuously reads this as a type of mysticism, since it violates his logical principles. In fact Russell's harsh criticism of Bergson solidifies the divide between analytic (mostly British and American) and continental (mostly French and German) philosophy. The phenomenologist philosophers who begin with Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger (not covered in Russell's survey) are in the continental camp, while the analytic philosophers who follow Bergson are in the analytic camp. The phenomenologists study the structures of consciousness from a first-person viewpoint. According to the _Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy_, "The central structure of an experience is its intentionality, its being directed toward something, as it is an experience of or about some object." Analytic philosophy, on the other hand, is grounded in logic and the use of language, so it is easy to see why Russell would dislike Bergson's point of view, which anticipates the phenomenologists.

Russell incorrectly lumps Bergson with the pragmatists, and he doesn't care for them much either. At first blush the pragmatists' radical empiricism, particularly as articulated by William James, would seem to be compatible with Russell's view. But Russell exposes the rather tenuous idea held by James that a belief is true if its effect is good—easily exposing the logical problems of such a view. John Dewey comes in for more serious criticism, no doubt because Russell takes Dewey more seriously as a philosopher. But Dewey shares with James the belief that truth should be judged by its effects rather than by any objective criteria. The empiricism of the pragmatists goes only so far. Dewey believes neither the universals of the rationalists nor the sense data of the empiricists are objects of knowledge. Rather, they are instruments of knowledge, and the function of knowledge is to solve problems. This is why Dewey replaces "truth" with "inquiry." Inquiry, which Dewey equates with scientific technique, must be applied to the development of values. Values are facts found in experience, and he does not separate values from empirical data derived from the senses. Dewey's concept of provisional truth goes against Russell's logic as well as his humanistic values. He fears, and rightly so, that a philosophy in which truth is no longer dependent on facts is akin to opening up a Pandora's box of abuses for power brokers who can easily misuse the tools of science and technology.

#  Book 3, Part 2, Chapter 31 : Modern Philosophy (From Rousseau to the Present Day) | Summary

## Summary

In this final chapter, titled "The Philosophy of Logical Analysis," [Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) reiterates the great divide in philosophy, reaching back to Pythagoras, between those inspired by mathematics and those by the empirical sciences. The mathematical party is more speculative and religious, while the empirical party is more practical and down to earth. Russell now seeks to locate his own school of logical analysis, which sets out to eliminate "Pythagoreanism" (metaphysics) from mathematics and "combine empiricism with an interest in the deductive parts of human knowledge." He explains how more recent mathematicians, such as Georg Cantor (1845–1918), have eliminated certain errors from analytical geometry and infinitesimal calculus. He mentions that philosopher and mathematician Gottlob Frege (1848–1925) more clearly has defined what numbers are. "From Frege's work it followed that arithmetic, and pure mathematics generally, is nothing but a prolongation of deductive logic." Frege's work has disproved Kant's theory about arithmetic propositions and led to the development of pure mathematics from logic, which is laid out in Russell's and Alfred North Whitehead's _Principia Mathematica_. Whitehead, a philosopher and mathematician, worked with Russell on the theory that mathematics could be reduced to a branch of logic. Philosopher Rudolf Carnap (1891–1970) has proposed that "philosophical problems are really syntactical," and "when errors in syntax are avoided, a philosophical problem is ... either solved or shown to be insoluble."

Physics has "supplied material for the philosophy of logical analysis ... especially through the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics." Space-time has replaced space and time. What previously was thought of as a particle will now have to be looked at as a series of events. The new physics has taught philosophers that "matter" is a "convenient way of collecting events into bundles." "Continuity of motion ... appears to have been a mere prejudice," according to quantum theory.

Modern analytical empiricism differs from the old empiricism because it incorporates mathematics and has developed "a powerful logical technique." As a result, it can address certain problems that seem to be more in the realm of science than philosophy. Nonetheless, while the new empiricism addresses the part of philosophy concerned with the nature of the world, there are still the ethical or political doctrines that address the question of how a person should live. Unfortunately, these two streams in philosophy have often been conflated, leading to a lot of confused thinking. Moreover, some philosophers have imposed their own moral prejudices on philosophical thinking in a desire to educate people or make them more virtuous. But Russell says, "Morally, a philosopher who uses his professional competence for anything except a disinterested search for truth is guilty of a kind of treachery." Philosophers of logical analysis "confess frankly that the human intellect" cannot find answers to many of the most profoundly important questions that lie at the heart of life. At the same time, these empiricists don't believe there is a "'higher' way of knowing ... hidden from science and the intellect." In Russell's view, even though philosophy (i.e., his philosophy) has let go of dogmatism, it still can "suggest and inspire a way of life."

## Analysis

In this chapter [Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/author/) reiterates the argument between rationalism and empiricism that dates back to the Greek philosopher Pythagoras and then recaps the advances in mathematics and logic until the present day, mentioning his own volume written with Alfred North Whitehead, _Principia Mathematica_, which seeks to locate mathematics as a subset within logic. However, he fails to mention the mathematician who permanently disproved his most cherished theory, Kurt Gödel (1906–78). A mathematician, logician, and philosopher, Gödel formulated one of the most significant theories in the history of mathematics when he published his two incompleteness theorems in 1931.

The first incompleteness theorem says, according to the _Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy_, that within "any consistent formal system _F_ within which a certain amount of arithmetic can be carried out, there are statements of the language of _F_ which can neither be proved nor disproved in _F_." The second incompleteness theorem says that such a system cannot prove itself to be consistent. Thus Gödel's proofs establish a distinction between proof and truth, when previously their unity had been the unquestioned foundation of mathematics. His proofs expose the limits of logic in seeking truth. Gödel permanently blocks the road on which Whitehead and Russell set out, detailed in the three volumes of _Principia Mathematica_. This magnum opus describes a set of axioms and rules of inference in symbolic logic from which all mathematical truths can in principle be proven. While Whitehead and Russell's work is still considered to be a seminal text in the philosophy of mathematics, Gödel's work destroyed Russell's dream of building a grand edifice of logic. Gödel's theorems show that no system can ever be complete nor prove its own consistency. Alas there can never be one set of axioms sufficient for all mathematics. Gödel's incompleteness theorems have had a profound impact on mathematics and artificial intelligence (AI) development, since computers are powered by formal programs that use symbolic logic and rules of inference. Gödel was to mathematics what Copernicus was to astronomy and Albert Einstein to physics. They all heralded momentous and game-changing revolutions.

Despite railing against Platonic idealism, Russell took a Platonic view of logic, which he later described as a "kind of mathematical mysticism." As an old man he said of himself: "I disliked the real world and sought refuge in a timeless world, without change or decay or the will-o'-the-wisp of progress." Russell's God is mathematics, where he hopes to find immutable truths. He had believed this realm was accessible through logic, which is why he pursued this field with such single-minded love and purpose.

Russell ends his treatise, written during the madness of Hitler's rampage through Europe, by asserting that amid "the welter of conflicting fanaticisms" scientific truthfulness is a unifying force. Scientific truth is defined by Russell as belief based on observation and inference, "divested of local and temperamental bias, as [much as] is possible for human beings." He insists on this virtue in philosophy, and he says his school of analytical philosophy has "invented a powerful method by which [scientific truth] can be rendered fruitful." But perhaps he goes too far in categorically asserting that there is no "'higher' way of knowing ... hidden from science and the intellect." There may be multiple ways of knowing, after all, and they are not necessarily hierarchical. The truth-seeking philosopher ought never to close off any avenues of inquiry.

> This mystical element entered into Greek philosophy with Pythagoras, who was a reformer of Orphism. 

[Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figures/#Bertrand_Russell), [Book 1, Part 1, Chapter 1](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/book-1-part-1-chapters-1-2-summary/)

Russell has already explained that the Orphics belonged to an ascetic religious sect, and Pythagoras is a reformer of Orphism. Pythagoras held religious ideas, such as a belief in the transmigration of the soul from life to life. He believed the contemplative life (philosophy) can release a person from the wheel of birth and death. Plato was influenced by Pythagoras, says the narrator, and religious elements in Greek philosophy were handed down from Pythagoras to Plato to his followers.

> All particular sensible objects ... are ... intermediate between being and not-being, and are [not] suitable as objects ... of knowledge. 

[Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figures/#Bertrand_Russell), [Book 1, Part 2, Chapter 15](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/book-1-part-2-chapters-14-18-summary/)

Plato claims that any _thing_ "partakes" of attributes that are the opposite of its major attributes—for example, if something is beautiful it has ugly aspects. Therefore, _things_ cannot be the source of infallible knowledge. For this reason he says sensible objects are intermediary between being and not being and are suitable objects for opinion, not for knowledge.

3.

> The supreme happiness is in the exercise of reason, for reason, more than anything else, is man. 

[Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figures/#Bertrand_Russell), [Book 1, Part 2, Chapter 20](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/book-1-part-2-chapters-19-23-summary/)

This statement occurs in Aristotle's book on ethics, in his discussion of happiness. For him the highest form of happiness is had by the philosopher. Happiness is derived from virtuous activity, and the best of all activities is contemplation, or the exercise of reason. This best and highest activity is closest to God.

4.

> Aristotle is the last Greek philosopher who faces the world cheerfully. 

[Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figures/#Bertrand_Russell), [Book 1, Part 3, Chapter 26](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/book-1-part-3-chapters-25-26-summary/)

In Russell's view Aristotle has an optimistic outlook on life, as did the philosophers before him. But after Aristotle philosophy goes into "retreat," Russell says. Philosophers teach the world is "bad" and people must detach themselves from it. This statement precedes his discussion of the Cynics and Skeptics.

5.

> If Judaism as a religion had perished under Antiochus, the seed-bed of Christianity would have been lacking. 

[Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figures/#Bertrand_Russell), [Book 2, Part 1, Chapter 1](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/book-2-part-1-chapters-1-2-summary/)

Russell makes this statement within the context of relating how the Jews fought against the persecution of Antiochus IV, holding to the tenets of their religion and religious practice. At that time the Jews who had already left their homeland were becoming more assimilated. Therefore, if Antiochus had succeeded in Hellenizing the Jews of Judea, Christianity would not have arisen.

6.

> The State could ... be part of the City of God by [submission to] the Church in ... religious matters. 

[Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figures/#Bertrand_Russell), [Book 2, Part 1, Chapter 4](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/book-2-part-1-chapters-3-4-summary/)

Russell is discussing one of Saint Augustine's most important works, _The City of God_, a theological and philosophical treatise. Augustine lays down a principle for separation of Church and state, giving the state a subordinate role in matters of religion. This is the position the Catholic Church has maintained ever since.

7.

> Aristotle's views on most questions of logic and philosophy ... have since been proved to be largely erroneous. 

[Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figures/#Bertrand_Russell), [Book 2, Part 2, Chapter 13](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/book-2-part-2-chapters-13-15-summary/)

The author's main areas of expertise in philosophy are mathematics and logic. In his earlier account of Aristotle he faults Aristotle for his mistaken logic and notes how some people "with a strange tenacity [adhere] to a system which is as definitely antiquated as Ptolemaic astronomy." In his discussion of Saint Thomas Aquinas the narrator now states categorically that Aristotle's logic is faulty. Aquinas is noted for marrying Aristotelian philosophy to Catholic theology.

8.

> Although most ... men of science were models of piety ... their work was disturbing to orthodoxy. 

[Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figures/#Bertrand_Russell), [Book 3, Part 1, Chapter 6](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/book-3-part-1-chapters-4-6-summary/)

Russell makes this statement in the context of his discussion of the rise of science in Europe in the 17th century. Men of science are not atheists but sincere believers: for example, Isaac Newton, the father of modern physics, says God hurled the planets into space. Nonetheless, the ideas that people like Newton and others raise disturb Catholic orthodoxy since they challenged the Bible's view of creation and prove man is not at the center of the physical cosmos.

9.

> The Cartesian system presents two ... independent worlds ... mind ... and matter, each of which can be studied [separately]. 

[Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figures/#Bertrand_Russell), [Book 3, Part 1, Chapter 9](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/book-3-part-1-chapters-9-11-summary/)

In his discussion of René Descartes Russell explains how the philosopher posited three types of substances: mind, matter, and God. Mind is incorporeal and separate from matter, and Descartes imagines them uniting in a human being in the pineal gland. Descartes further separated body and mind and spirit and matter in his dualistic system.

10.

> Locke [is] the founder of empiricism, which is the doctrine that ... knowledge ... is derived from experience. 

[Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figures/#Bertrand_Russell), [Book 3, Part 1, Chapter 13](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/book-3-part-1-chapters-12-15-summary/)

In his discussion of Locke's theory of knowledge Russell asserts that some regard Locke as the first empiricist. Locke was contemptuous of metaphysics, says Russell, and asserted that the concept of _substance_ is vague. Locke was not interested in metaphysical arguments about God and thought in concrete detail about what he could see, hear, touch, smell, and taste.

11.

> All our reasonings concerning causes and effects are derived from nothing but custom. 

[Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figures/#Bertrand_Russell), [Book 3, Part 1, Chapter 17](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/book-3-part-1-chapters-16-17-summary/)

Russell here quotes David Hume directly, who is explaining that there is no scientific basis for inductive reasoning. Specifically, just because one ball hitting another causes the second ball to move 100 times, there is no evidence to prove that the second ball will move on the 101st try.

12.

> To frame a philosophy [to cope] with men intoxicated with ... unlimited power ... is the most pressing task of our time. 

[Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figures/#Bertrand_Russell), [Book 3, Part 2, Chapter 21](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/book-3-part-2-chapters-21-22-summary/)

The author makes this statement at the end of his discussion about 19th-century thought. He believes that certain 19th-century ideas laid the groundwork for the glorification of the autocratic state. He is writing in 1943, when the Allies are fighting to avoid possible world domination by fascists, and he believes men drunk on power are the worst dangers to civilization.

13.

> I dislike Nietzsche because ...he most admires ... conquerors, whose glory is cleverness in causing men to die. 

[Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figures/#Bertrand_Russell), [Book 3, Part 2, Chapter 25](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/book-3-part-2-chapters-23-25-summary/)

Russell provides a somewhat biased account of the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche, a 19th-century philosopher who admires conquerors like Napoleon Bonaparte. Nietzsche is one of the German philosophers the narrator dislikes for helping lay the groundwork for fascism in Germany.

14.

> I feel a grave danger, the danger of what might be called cosmic impiety. 

[Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figures/#Bertrand_Russell), [Book 3, Part 2, Chapter 30](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/book-3-part-2-chapters-28-30-summary/)

Russell has deconstructed the pragmatist philosophy of John Dewey, which put "inquiry" in place of "truth." In the narrator's view Dewey's embrace of the idea that the truth can be arrived at through "mutual adjustment" is based in an overenthusiastic faith in American technological know-how. In the author's view the "revived ... sense of the collective power of human communities" in the modern age needs to be checked by humility. The intoxication of power is a madness that can lead to "social disaster."

15.

> They refuse to believe there is some "higher" way of knowing ... hidden from science and the intellect. 

[Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/key-figures/#Bertrand_Russell), [Book 3, Part 2, Chapter 31](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/A-History-of-Western-Philosophy/book-3-part-2-chapter-31-summary/)

In the last chapter of his treatise Russell introduces analytic philosophers like himself who believe there are some questions important to human beings that can be answered neither by science nor philosophy. Nonetheless, the analytic philosopher will not stoop to believing there is some metaphysical secret or key to higher knowledge that can satisfactorily answer these questions.

# Biography

Bertrand Arthur William Russell, Third Earl of Kingston Russell and Viscount of Amberley, was born May 18, 1872, in Trellech, Monmouthshire, Wales, in Great Britain. Russell's mother and sister died of diphtheria, a nose and throat infection, in 1874, and his father died of bronchitis, an inflammation of the tubes that carry air to and from the lungs, two years later, so the philosopher barely knew his freethinking parents.

### Early Life

Russell's father had granted custody of his sons (Russell and his older brother Frank) to atheist friends, but their paternal grandparents had the will overturned. As a result the boys were raised by their grandmother, Lady Russell, after her husband died when Russell was five. While Frank was sent away to school, Russell's early education was by tutors at home, under the supervision of the highly educated and religious Lady Russell. Russell learned French, German, and mathematics from an early age and began to have doubts about Christianity in his adolescence. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1890, where he met English mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead, with whom he would later collaborate on _Principia Mathematica_ (1910). Awarded high honors in mathematics in 1893, Russell became interested in philosophy and won a fellowship based on his thesis, _An Essay on the Foundations of Geometry_, published as his first philosophical work in 1897. He won a first-class degree with distinction in philosophy in 1894 and was elected as a fellow to Trinity in 1895.

### Work in Political Science and Mathematics

In the years 1894–96, Russell married his first wife, Alys Pearsall Smith, and became an agnostic, or someone who neither categorically denies nor asserts the existence of a divine being or first cause. He also formulated a plan to write two books—one on the philosophy of the sciences and the other on social and political issues. The couple visited Berlin in 1895, which resulted in Russell's first political treatise, _German Social Democracy_ (1896). Russell sympathized with the Socialists in Germany but was critical of the dogma of German philosopher Karl Marx. Socialism is a democratically controlled economy in which unregulated capitalism is replaced with regulated commerce and some level of community and/or government control. Karl Marx advocated for a more radical form of socialism in which the means of production is owned by the working class.

Shortly after writing his book on socialism, Russell abandoned the metaphysical idealism of German philosophers Immanuel Kant and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel; Russell rejected the notion of any kind of absolute, timeless substance beyond or behind the physical world. Rather, he was interested in creating a precise philosophy of mathematics that would be scientific and rigorous. Russell had acquainted himself with the work of German mathematicians who wanted to prove mathematics could be grounded in a foundation of logic. He came to the conclusion that analysis, not synthesis, was the way for philosophy to move forward. Analytic and synthetic propositions in philosophy differ in that analytic statements are based on sensory data (either one's own or data collected by others), while synthetic statements are based on reasoning about sensory data.

Inspired by the work of the Germans, Russell wanted to show mathematics was nothing but logic—an idea later called logicism. His ideas were elaborated in _The Principles of Mathematics_, published in 1903. Before publication he quickly added an appendix when Russell learned German mathematician Gottlob Frege had anticipated some of his ideas. The appendix discusses Frege's earlier discoveries. In his own treatise Russell also elaborates on his discovery of a contradiction at the heart of logicism, dubbed "Russell's Paradox," which continued to be a stumbling block in his development of an all-encompassing logical system. The contradiction is that in some sets (classes of objects), members are also members of themselves (the class of all classes) and some are not (for example, the class of human beings). The class of all classes is the set that includes everything that can be thought of—for example, the entire set of all biological living things on Earth. Thus it should be possible to create a set (a class of all classes) that is not a member of itself. But such an idea is a contradiction. Is the class of all biological things a member of itself? The answer is yes and no.

Russell continued to wrestle with his paradox, which resulted in a theory of types and other logical innovations published in a three-volume work written with Whitehead and titled _Principia Mathematica_. Their groundbreaking work was published from 1910 to 1913. Immensely important in the development of the philosophy of mathematics, their theory of descriptions helped remove the logical awkwardness of appearing to refer to things that do not exist. Nonetheless, Austrian American mathematician and philosopher Kurt Gödel proved no single theory can be used to derive the whole of mathematics and all consistent theories of arithmetic are necessarily incomplete. Russell wrote subsequent philosophical works focusing on epistemology (theory of knowledge), arguing the world is made of sense data. He eventually replaced this idea with "neutral monism," or the theory that the "ultimate stuff" of the world was neither mental nor physical but something between the two.

### Russell and Morrell and Wittgenstein

While Russell continued his philosophical work, his marriage deteriorated. In 1911 he fell in love with the married Lady Ottoline Morrell, although she did not want to leave her husband. Russell finally left his wife, however, and began writing, partly due to Morrell's influence, in a style suited for a general audience. This resulted in a best-selling survey of philosophy called _The Problems of Philosophy_, published in 1911. Russell also met the young Austrian British philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, who had come to Cambridge to study logic with him. Wittgenstein ended up publishing a text undermining Russell's approach to the subject. This led Russell to give up writing technical philosophy and begin pursuing other interests. In fact he abandoned a companion volume to the _Principia Mathematica_, which would have had epistemology (theory of knowledge) as its subject because of Wittgenstein's criticisms of his work.

### Agitator for Peace and Political Change

Russell worked full time as a peace warrior after the British entered World War I (1914–18). He ended up serving six months in prison at the end of the war. In 1916 he was fired from his professorship at Trinity College because of his antiwar activities. The college offered to rehire him after the war, but Russell instead became a journalist and freelance writer. The war pushed him from liberalism to socialism, and he expressed his Socialist ideas in a number of books. He continued promoting a Socialist and progressive agenda with his new wife, Dora Black. They married in 1921 and had two children. Russell expanded the scope of his writing to include education, morality, and social issues. During this period he delivered his famous public lecture on "Why I Am Not a Christian." In 1927 the couple opened a progressive school, Beacon Hill, and Russell lectured in the United States. Since both Russell and his wife did not follow conventional morality, Dora had two children with another man. Eventually the couple could not resolve their differences, and Russell married Patricia Spence in 1937 and had another child who grew up to be a prominent historian.

Russell lived in the United States from 1938 until 1944, first teaching at the University of Chicago and then at the University of California, Los Angeles. He was hired by City College of New York, but his appointment was revoked because of complaints about his morals. Then he was hired by the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia to lecture on philosophy. These lectures formed the basis for what became _A History of Western Philosophy_. He lost his job at the foundation after a falling out with the founder. In 1944 he returned to Trinity College and finally lost his status as a pariah. He received the Order of Merit from the British Government in 1949 and the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1950, in large part because of his work on _A History of Western Philosophy_, which was also a best-selling book and a major source of income. However, his third marriage also fell apart.

### Final Years

Russell married for the fourth and final time in 1952, to Edith Finch, at age 80. In 1955 he and German theoretical physicist Albert Einstein signed and released a declaration to world leaders calling for an end to war in the age of nuclear weapons, which threatened the continued existence of the human race. He spent his remaining years involved in peace work, campaigning against nuclear weapons and in the 1960s against the Vietnam War. The Vietnam War (1955–75) was a conflict between Communist North Vietnam and the autocratic nationalist government of South Vietnam in which the United States supported South Vietnam because it was anti-Communist. Russell took part in mass demonstrations and incited young people to commit acts of civil disobedience in the name of peace. In 1961 when Russell was 89, he was sentenced to jail time for his role in antinuclear protests, although he ended up spending only a week in the prison hospital. Russell died on February 2, 1970, at age 97. While at the time he was best known as a social critic, he is remembered as an essayist, logician, and philosopher of mathematics. He produced 70 books and many articles in his lifetime and refined Frege's predicate calculus, the basis for most contemporary systems of logic. Together with English philosopher George Edward Moore, he is the founder of modern analytic philosophy. His and Whitehead's _Principia Mathematica_ remains an important text in the study of logic.

# 10 Things You Didn't Know

Bertrand Russell's _A History of Western Philosophy_, first published in 1945, is a sweeping survey of the European and American philosophical tradition. Russell chronicles the history of philosophical thought from the time of the ancients, such as Plato and Aristotle, to the modern philosophers of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Russell divided his history into three distinct parts: ancient philosophy, Catholic philosophy, and modern philosophy (beginning with the Renaissance thinkers).

_A History of Western Philosophy_ started as a series of lectures, and it turned into a huge success for Russell. For decades people turned to it as the definitive historical record of Western philosophy. Though critics have, over the years, found mistakes and inherent biases in Russell's text, _A History of Western Philosophy_ is still seen as one of the crowning achievements in documenting the development of and changes in Western thought over millennia. Furthermore, the book was the most heavily contributing factor earning Russell the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1950.

## 1. Russell worked with Albert Einstein to call for the end of nuclear weapons.

In addition to his philosophical thought, Russell was known for his commitment to [antinuclear protests](https://pugwash.org/1955/07/09/statement-manifesto/). In 1945—the same year as _A History of Western Philosophy_ was published—he delivered a BBC broadcast, entitled "Man's Peril," condemning the tests of nuclear weapons. The next year, he teamed up with renowned scientist and mathematician Albert Einstein to release the "Russell-Einstein Manifesto," calling upon the world's national governments to cease production of nuclear warheads and begin disarming those already built. In later years, he continued stressing the importance of arms reduction, founding the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in 1958. In 1961 Russell was actually arrested and imprisoned for protesting the continued development of nuclear technology.

## 2. Russell's wife did a lot of the research for _A History of Western Philosophy_.

Although _A History of Western Philosophy_ was published under Russell's name, his wife, [Patricia Helen Spence](https://books.google.com/books?id=tX3pf07zGb4C&lpg=PA223&dq=a%20history%20of%20western%20philosophy%20russell%27s%20wife%20did%20the%20research&pg=PA223#v=onepage&q&f=false), allegedly did a great deal of the necessary research for the project. Trained as a historian, her research contributed to several of Russell's books over the course of their marriage. In addition to research, she also edited—and even wrote—portions of the manuscript of _A History of Western Philosophy_ for her husband.

## 3. Russell had an affair with the wife of famous British poet T.S. Eliot.

Russell's love life was interesting, to say the least. He was married and divorced several times and was notorious for having mistresses. Allegedly, one of these lovers was [Vivienne Eliot](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/21/books/the-hollow-man-and-his-wife.html), wife of famous British poet T.S. Eliot, best known for his 1922 poem "The Waste Land." The alleged affair occurred from 1915 to 1918, shortly after Eliot and Vivienne wed. Although the poet seemed to be aware of [the adultery](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/oct/14/features.review)—even going so far as to say Russell "has done evil" to Vivienne's mental health—Eliot allowed Vivienne to stay at Russell's home in England.

## 4. Russell was sentenced to prison—and hard labor—for objecting to World War I.

Russell's 1961 arrest for protesting nuclear weaponry wasn't his first run-in with the law. During World War I, Russell was a [conscientious objector](https://trinitycollegelibrarycambridge.wordpress.com/2014/07/10/wwi-russell/), refusing to fight on ethical grounds. At the onset of the conflict, Russell protested against conscription, authoring a pamphlet denouncing the practice. Russell and six coconspirators were arrested under the "Defence of the Realm Act," legislation that gave the government greater power in Britain during war. Russell took full responsibility, claiming, "If anyone is to be prosecuted I am the person primarily responsible." Russell was sentenced to six months in prison, with occasional hard labor tasks. In his autobiography, the philosopher admitted that he didn't mind imprisonment one bit and even found it peaceful. [He claimed](https://books.google.com/books?id=9UlpAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA256&lpg=PA256&dq=%22I+found+prison+in+many+ways+quite+agreeable.+I+had+no+engagements,+no+difficult+decisions+to+make%22&source=bl&ots=7E1WNdXN5o&sig=r1yw-SFXtsZMXP-3DclYPF5ccfk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjQo63k9PfXAhWxlOAKHUeLCeAQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&q=%22I%20found%20prison%20in%20many%20ways%20quite%20agreeable.%20I%20had%20no%20engagements%2C%20no%20difficult%20decisions%20to%20make%22&f=false):

>  I was able to read and write as much as I liked, provided I did no pacifist propaganda. I found prison in many ways quite agreeable. I had no engagements, no difficult decisions to make, no fear of callers, no interruptions to my work. 

## 5. _A_ _History of Western Philosophy_ was Russell's most lucrative venture, funded by an eccentric millionaire.

Of all his projects, _A History of Western Philosophy_ grossed the highest sales and made Russell the most money. Russell briefly held a job at the [Barnes Foundation](https://books.google.com/books?id=L9uhBQAAQBAJ&lpg=PA141&dq=a%20history%20of%20western%20philosophy%20provided%20russell%20with%20financial%20security&pg=PA141#v=onepage&q&f=false) in Philadelphia, an organization dedicated to promoting education in the arts and humanities. His philosophical thought intrigued the foundation's eccentric founder, Albert C. Barnes. Barnes paid Russell to give a series of lectures on the history of philosophy, which [served as the groundwork](https://books.google.com/books?id=u6rHBQAAQBAJ&lpg=PT53&dq=a%20history%20of%20western%20philosophy%20provided%20russell%20with%20financial%20security&pg=PT53#v=onepage&q&f=false) for _A History of Western Philosophy_. Once the book was published, it allowed Russell to support himself for the rest of his life.

## 6. Russell was upset by the critical reception of _A History of Western Philosophy_.

When _A History of Western Philosophy_ was published, it received mixed reviews and a heavy amount of criticism from academics. In particular, Russell was accused of holding a [great deal of bias](https://books.google.com/books?id=SA_hLTf__QMC&pg=PT15&lpg=PT15&dq=%22his+treatment+of+ancient+and+medieval+doctrines+is+nearly+worthless.%22&source=bl&ots=qz8ftgwNdk&sig=nsLiF3jzqo9JL4P_1bN6d-BqJCA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjr0dWg7vfXAhXKKyYKHfVwB_kQ6AEINzAB#v=onepage&q=%22his%20treatment%20of%20ancient%20and%20medieval%20doctrines%20is%20nearly%20worthless.%22&f=false) in his documentation of philosophy's history, only including what he personally felt was important and relevant. For example, Russell notoriously shirked the importance of St. Thomas Aquinas, famous for his medieval Christian treatise _Summa Theologiae._ One review claimed that "[Russell's] treatment of ancient and medieval doctrines is nearly worthless." Upon hearing a great deal of negative feedback, [Russell responded](https://books.google.com/books?id=uIKMAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA444&dq=%22I%20did%20my%20best%2C%20but%20I%20am%20not%20at%20all%20sure%20that%20I%20succeeded.%20I%20was%20sometimes%20accused%20by%20reviewers%20of%20writing%20not%20a%20true%20history%20but%20a%20biased%20account%20of%20the%20events%20that%20I%20arbitrarily%20chosen%20to%20write%20of.%22&pg=PA444#v=onepage&q&f=false):

>  I did my best, but I am not at all sure that I succeeded. I was sometimes accused by reviewers of writing not a true history but a biased account of the events that I arbitrarily chose to write of. But to my mind, a man without a bias cannot write interesting history—if, indeed, such a man exists. 

## 7. When Russell's parents died, his grandparents wanted custody so he wouldn't be raised as a "free thinker."

Russell's parents were extremely liberal politically, but his grandparents were most decidedly conservative. Both Russell's mother and father had died by the time he was four, and he was sent to live with his grandmother, who was nicknamed "[the deadly nightshade](https://books.google.com/books?id=Yt4FCAAAQBAJ&lpg=PA43&dq=bertrand%20russell%20grandparents%20custody&pg=PA43#v=onepage&q&f=false)" due to her cold demeanor and high standards for discipline. Russell's father's will had specifically called for the boy to be raised by two of his father's intellectual friends, but Russell's grandfather—Lord John Russell, former Prime Minister of Britain—was able to overturn the document and [win custody](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell/) in court.

## 8. One critic called _A History of Western Philosophy_ "vulgar" for omitting one particular philosopher.

It's hard to imagine a work of philosophical history being "vulgar," but that's exactly how American critic George Steiner [referred to the book](https://books.google.com/books?id=qdMjbczcKcwC&lpg=PT25&dq=george%20steiner%20a%20history%20of%20western%20philosophy%20vulgar&pg=PT25#v=onepage&q&f=false) due to a particular omission. Russell neglected to discuss German philosopher Martin Heidegger in _A History of Western Philosophy_—leading Steiner to call the work "a vulgar but representative book." [Steiner speculated](https://books.google.com/books?id=qdMjbczcKcwC&lpg=PT25&dq=george%20steiner%20a%20history%20of%20western%20philosophy%20vulgar&pg=PT25#v=onepage&q&f=false) that Heidegger's absence may have been due to his extremely technical and far-reaching philosophical method, which—he admitted—often seemed more like linguistics or theology than philosophy.

## 9. _A History of Western Philosophy_ was accused of spreading "myths" about philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.

Another perceived fault in _A History of Western Philosophy_ concerned 19th-century German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, famous for his theory of "absolute idealism." Along with other Anglo-American philosophers, Russell [has been accused](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/us/stewart.htm) of falsely branding Hegel as illogical, intentionally ignoring simple facts of logical philosophy in order to make his premises valid. Russell insinuated that Hegel "ignored the law of contradiction," which simply means that a thing cannot be something it is not. Defenders of Hegel claim that his philosophical works cannot be read through the lens of logic, as he did not practice the same type of mathematical, analytic philosophy that was popular among American and British figures in the field such as Russell.

## 10. Russell may have fallen in love with the wife of philosopher Alfred North Whitehead.

Another rumor circulated about Russell's love life involved yet another famous academic figure's wife—this time, the young bride of English mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead. Russell and his then-wife, Alys, stayed at Whitehead's home for a brief time, where, allegedly, Russell became enamored with Whitehead's wife Evelyn. The couples lived together while the two men worked on a collaborative mathematical work entitled _Principia Mathematica_, but Russell may have been [distracted by Evelyn](https://books.google.com/books?id=AzssomBIDRIC&lpg=PA129&dq=bertrand%20russell%20evelyn%20whitehead&pg=PA129#v=onepage&q&f=false). Although scholars believe it's unlikely that Russell had an affair with Evelyn, particularly since Russell's wife was living with them as well, many agree that he fell head-over-heels for his coauthor's spouse.
