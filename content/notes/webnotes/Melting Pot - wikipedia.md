**_The melting pot_** is a _monocultural metaphor_ for a heterogeneous society becoming more homogeneous, or a heterogeneous society becoming more homogeneous through the influx of foreign elements. It can also create a harmonious hybridized society known as _cultural amalgamation_. The metaphor was used in the United States after it was used as a metaphor in a 1908 play by **Israel Zangwill**, which celebrated the cultural intermixing of immigrants in New York City. The play, _The Melting Pot_, combined a romantic denouement with an utopian vision of the United States as an ideal republic and a new promised land. The metaphor implied both a melting of cultures and intermarriage of ethnicities, yet it also created a distinction between European immigrants and non-European immigrants, especially African-Americans. The melting pot model has been challenged by proponents of _multiculturalism_, who have suggested alternative metaphors to describe the current American society, such as a _salad bowl_ or a _kaleidoscope_, in which different cultures mix, but remain distinct in some aspects. The melting pot model continues to be used as an assimilation model in vernacular and political discourse, as well as in academic debates on identity, adaptation and integration of immigrants into various spheres.
