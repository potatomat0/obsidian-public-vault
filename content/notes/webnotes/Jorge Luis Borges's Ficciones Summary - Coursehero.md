### Author

Jorge Luis Borges

### Year Published

1944

### Type

Short Stories

### Genre

Fiction

### At a Glance

_Ficciones_ is a classic of modern world literature. In these stories Jorge Luis Borges imagines alternate universes with elaborate, conceptual underpinnings. He makes the common-sense view of the reader's own world seem suddenly strange or fantastical. Sometimes Borges's mystics and seekers are fictional. Sometimes they are real philosophers turned into fictional characters. He uses his stories not to instruct readers in mystical truths but to invite readers to marvel at the inventiveness of the human mind, which can dream up such fictions.

### Perspective and Narrator

Some stories are told by a third-person narrator, some by a first-person narrator. Several are in the guise of commentary on imaginary books and authors.

### About the Title

_Ficciones_ is a Spanish word meaning "fictions." By calling the pieces in the book "ficciones" rather than stories, Jorge Luis Borges emphasizes their particular genre status. Some of the pieces are commentaries on imaginary books. One such story, "The Approach to Al-Mu'tasim," was originally published in a book of Borges's essays, _A History of Eternity_. Borges later called it "a hoax _and_ a pseudo-essay," and said his friend Bioy Casares was so taken in he attempted to order the book from London. The other stories in _Ficciones_, too, explore ideas as much as they relate plots.

# Context

## Idealism

Idealism is a philosophy in which the highest reality is something beyond the physical world. For idealism the material world is secondary and the ideal world primary. The ancient Greek philosopher Plato believed ideal forms—such as justice, beauty, and equality—were the most important part of reality. The physical world, Plato taught, was based on the ideal world of forms. He believed people could not have direct physical contact with these forms but accessed them with their minds. In [Jorge Luis Borges](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/author/)'s "The Babylon Lottery," the narrator refers to these eternal forms: somewhere there is "the Celestial Archetype of the Lottery adored by Platonists."

In some stories in _Ficciones_ Borges carries this philosophy further, even to extremes. The narrator of "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius" refers to George Berkeley, an Irish idealist credited with the belief material things exist only when someone perceives them. When the perception stops—when the lights go out—the thing stops existing. On Earth Berkeley's ideas are scandalous but not believable, says the narrator of "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius." But on Tlön, planet of the radical idealists, Berkeleyism makes perfect sense. Material things are not real on Tlön unless a mind perceives them. "At times some birds, a horse, have saved the ruins of an amphitheater," says the narrator. The animals perceive the amphitheater, maintaining it in existence.

Another well-known idealist was the 19th-century German philosopher G.W.F. Hegel. One of his great systematic works, _Phenomenology of Spirit_, is about the one ultimate reality, which he called Absolute Spirit. The Spirit comes to know itself, partly through becoming nature. Thus the things of the world are Spirit come down to Earth. Hegel is called an idealist because the Spirit remains the ultimate. When someone objected that facts contradicted his ideas, Hegel is reported to have said, "So much the worse for the facts." Whether he actually said it does not matter. The sentiment expressed is an enchantment with theory and a disdain for actuality. These traits are exhibited by the detective [Erik Lönnrot](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/character-analysis/#Erik_L%C3%B6nnrot) in "Death and the Compass." While investigating a series of murders, Lönnrot is interested in books and especially in his own hypotheses, which have an obligation to be "interesting." Reality, by comparison, is of little interest to Lönnrot. When he reaches the conceptual solution to the murder mystery, he does not concern himself with details like "names, prison records, faces, judicial and penal proceedings." These he dismisses as insignificant, "mere circumstances, or reality."

Many of Borges's stories revolve around a metaphysical premise. Metaphysics refers to the philosophical examination of the universe: how things come to be, what is real and what is not. Examples of such metaphysical premises in _Ficciones_ are a world consisting of an infinite Library ("The Library of Babel"), a planet whose "language presupposes idealism" ("Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius"). In "An Examination of the Work of Herbert Quain" the fictional Quain follows out a metaphysical notion Borges himself playfully put forward in his essay "A New Refutation of Time," and published in his collection _Labyrinths_. In the essay Borges sets out to show time is not actually a succession of moments and in fact is not real. In the story "An Examination of the Work of Herbert Quain," Quain believes a repetition can prove time is not a sequence. Thus by committing his stories to philosophical ideas, Borges is something of an idealist himself.

## Gnosticism

_Gnosticism_ can be defined as "a religious doctrine promising salvation through knowledge of certain mystical truths." Such knowledge is intuited, or it is relayed in esoteric texts and magic formulas. This definition relies on the etymology of the word _Gnosticism_, which comes from the Greek _gnosis_, meaning "knowledge."

However, Gnosticism is not simply one religious movement. Rather it refers to numerous religious and philosophical movements in ancient Greece and Rome during the early Christian era. According to some Gnostic beliefs, there are two gods: a higher god, who gives human souls a divine spark, and a lesser god called a Demiurge, who created Earth. Earth is a failed creation, and divine souls have their true home elsewhere. In "Three Versions of Judas" the narrator refers to a similar belief, citing the era when the Gnostic "Basilides was announcing the cosmos was a rash and malevolent improvisation engineered by some defective angels."

In _Ficciones_ Borges often draws a parallel between artistic creation and the botched creation of the Gnostic Demiurge. The narrator of "The Circular Ruins" says the Gnostics tell of Demiurges creating "a red Adam," a failed, feeble Adam who cannot move or think. At first the dreamed-up young man in "The Circular Ruins" is like this failed Adam. He cannot move until he is infused with animating spirit from the god of fire. The dreaming man who creates him in "The Circular Ruins" is a kind of Demiurge. The story is also an allegory in which a Demiurgic creation stands for the perils, despair, and joys of artistic creation. In a typical Borgesian twist, the creator in "The Circular Ruins" discovers he himself is the dream of another creator.

The librarian narrator in "The Library of Babel" also refers to Gnosticism as a fable about failed creation. He says imperfect humankind "might be the work of chance or malevolent Demiurges." An artist, likewise, cannot create a human but only a representation of a human being, a literary character. But in Borges's version of gnostic creation, the fictional or dream can overcome reality. Thus in the story "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius" the secret society of philosophers acts as a Demiurge, creating another world. Like the gnostic "red Adam," the planet of Tlön is flawed and only partially realized, but it exerts a fatal attraction on the world.

## Metafiction

Metafiction is fiction that calls attention to its fictional status. It also can be defined as fiction that is aware of itself as fiction. The term _metafiction_ was coined by American novelist William Gass to describe the playful, self-conscious post-World War II works of writers such a Borges. Despite the newness of the term the concept of metafiction is old. For example, in Cervantes's 17th-century novel _Don Quixote_, Don Quixote and Sancho Panza learn a book has been written about their adventures and are aware of themselves as literary characters from that point on. Later in the book Don Quixote and Sancho Panza come upon a man reading _Don Quixote_. Don Quixote looks it over and scorns it as completely untrue. This playfully makes the reader aware of the novel's fictional status. In addition, _The Thousand and One Nights_ is also a metafictional work because it is a vast collection of stories united by a story about storytelling.

Both _Don Quixote_ and _The Thousand and One Nights_ appear in _Ficciones_. "[Pierre Menard](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/character-analysis/#Pierre_Menard), Author of Don Quixote" highlights its own fictional status by imitating a learned commentary on an imaginary book. Borges was delighted by fiction's ability to refer to itself because self-referential fiction offers the paradox of a human-made artifact with the appearance of infinity. In "The Garden of Forking Paths," a story about an infinite novel, Borges intensifies the self-referential quality of _The Thousand and One Nights_. With the authority of a scholar the narrator confidently asserts an untruth about _The Thousand and One Nights_. He refers to "the night in the middle" of the book when Scheherazade, "through a magical mistake on the part of her copyist, started to tell the story of The Thousand and One Nights." In this intensified version, _The Thousand and One Nights_ contains the story of _The Thousand and One Nights_. Therefore, this second-order or "meta" level must also contain another story of _The Thousand and One Nights_, and so on to infinity.

Although the story "The Library of Babel" does not state this, it is possible among its infinite books one contains the story "The Library of Babel." In _Ficciones_ Borges uses this metafictional device several times: the work contains another version of itself. In "The Approach to Al-Mu'tasim" Mir Bahadur Ali is the author of a novel called _The Approach to Al-Mu'tasim_. Dr. Yu Tsun's great-grandfather writes an infinite labyrinth of a novel called _The Garden of Forking Paths_ in the story "The Garden of Forking Paths." For Borges the attraction of these metafictional puzzles is the way in which they make the fictional seem real and the real seem fictional. He refers to this literary effect as "the contamination of reality by dream." Summarizing his ideas about metafiction in the essay "Partial Enchantments in the _Quixote_," published in _Labyrinths_, Borges asks why it bothers readers "that Don Quixote be a reader of _Quixote_." He answers if a fictional character can become a reader of such a work, then "we, its readers ... can become fictitious."

# Character Analysis

## Dr. Stephen Albert

Dr. Stephen Albert is a tall man "with gray eyes and a gray beard." Dr. Yu Tsun thinks there is "something of the priest, and something of the sailor" about him. In fact Dr. Albert had been a missionary in Tientsin, China. He later decided to become a sinologist. He is the only man who understands the secret of the labyrinth created by Ts'ui Pên, Dr. Yu Tsun's grandfather.

## Ireneo Funes

Ireneo Funes is a poor man and was born out of wedlock. He bears his mother's name, Funes, not his father's. It is rumored his father is an Englishman named O'Connor. He is born and dies in the city of Fray Bentos in Uruguay. To the Buenos Aries narrator of "Funes, the Memorious" Fray Bentos is in the remote hinterlands. As Funes becomes afflicted with acute perception and tremendous memory, even Fray Bentos becomes too much for him. He prefers to lie in the dark back room of his mother's shack. His great memory enables him to quickly learn languages. He develops a quixotic number system in which every number has its own unique, non-systematic name. But he cannot form general ideas. All his impressions are so precise, he cannot bear to lump them together in general concepts. Funes represents one of the quandaries 18th-century German philosopher Immanuel Kant outlined in _The Critique of Pure Reason_ when he said, "Thoughts without content are empty; intuitions [perceptions] without concepts are blind." Sequestered in darkness and unable to piece his multifarious perceptions together into concepts, Funes is metaphorically "blind." He is brilliant, but his brilliance is incommunicable and ultimately powerless.

## Jaromir Hladík

Hladík is a writer and translator who lives in Prague, Czechoslovakia. He is arrested during the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia at the start of World War II. As the narrator dryly says, he is accused of being Jewish, which he is. He is also accused of "Judaizing," as the Nazis say, the works of a German. This is also true, in a narrow sense, since Hladík wrote about mystical Jewish influence on the German mystic Jakob Böhme. Hladík is not a very renowned writer. In a twist of fate, a friend intercedes for Hladík, trying to convince the Nazis Hladík is an important scholarly translator. The Nazis are convinced, but this makes them even more eager to execute Hladík. Hladík passes the time in prison in an agony of anticipation.

## Erik Lönnrot

Lönnrot is modeled after Edgar Allan Poe's 19th-century fictional detective Auguste Dupin and the 20th-century fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. Like them Lönnrot is a gentleman of leisure who takes on criminal cases for his own intellectual interest. He rejects simple explanations in favor of "interesting" ones. However, Lönnrot is wrong about everything in "Death and the Compass." When confronted with his errors, he displays a gentlemanly fatalism. Not only does he submit to his death at the hands of the arch-criminal Red Scharlach, he also proposes they will have this fatal encounter again and again, as time repeats itself.

## Pierre Menard

Apart from his two chapters of Don Quixote, Pierre Menard's literary works largely consist of commentary, along with some sonnets and translations. He has written scholarly monographs on a Borgesian range of topics, at once broad and obscure: the 17th-century German philosopher and mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz; the 13th-century Catalan mystic and poet Ramón Llull; and the metric laws of French prose, among others. His ambition to write _Don Quixote_ is simultaneously large and small. To perfectly recreate the 17th-century Spanish novel is a huge ambition. But if Menard succeeds, he should disappear as an author, since his work would be exactly the same as Cervantes's.

## John Vincent Moon

At first the narrator thinks Moon is "the Englishman of La Colorada." Moon explains he is Irish but otherwise carries on with the pretense he is not John Vincent Moon. He relates his infamies, his arrogance, and his self-dealing in pitiless detail. Moon encourages his listener to judge Moon harshly, by portraying him as perfectly blameworthy. The Moon who lives in South America seems a changed man. Moon in Ireland was lazy and gave the impression "of being an invertebrate." Moon in South America works the land alongside his _peones_. He is no longer as aloof from the world as the fiery but cowardly Marxist of his Irish republican days. But he invites the narrator to participate in his self-loathing, enjoining him, "Despise me." He has not gotten over his acts of cowardice.

## Commissioner Treviranus

Treviranus is the police commissioner in a "Buenos Aires of dreams," as Borges says in the prologue to Part 2. Treviranus plays the bumbling, narrow-minded Lestrade figure to Lönnrot's brilliant Sherlock Holmes–style detective in "Death and the Compass." Where Lönnrot sees a complicated plot entangled with Jewish mysticism, Treviranus sees a simple case of a robbery gone wrong. He has no patience with Lönnrot's speculations. When Treviranus receives a long letter from someone calling himself "Spinoza" (a 17th-century Dutch Jewish philosopher), Treviranus immediately passes this "piece of insanity" on to Lönnrot, who "deserves" it. However, unlike the policeman Lestrade in the Sherlock Holmes's stories, Treviranus has the right theory of the crimes in "Death and the Compass."

#  Part 1, Prologue : The Garden of Forking Paths | Summary

## Summary

The stories of Part 1 of _Ficciones_ need no "extraneous elucidation," but [Borges](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/author/) comments on some of the stories nonetheless. "The Garden of Forking Paths" is a detective story in which the motive for the crime is not entirely known until the end. The other seven stories are fantasies. Borges claims he is "not the first author of the narrative titled 'The Library of Babel.'" That is, he is not the first writer to propose an infinite Library. He hints most of "[Pierre Menard](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/character-analysis/#Pierre_Menard), Author of Don Quixote" is realistic, the only unreal thing in the story being "the destiny [Menard] impose[s] upon himself."

Next Borges describes the advantage of writing stories about imaginary books. Because "the composition of vast books is a laborious and impoverishing extravagance," it's better to "pretend these books already exist, and then to offer a résumé, a commentary." Three of the stories in Part 1 are of this kind: "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius," "An Examination of the Work of Herbert Quain," and "The Approach to Al-Mu'tasim." In abstract terms Borges compares "The Approach to Al-Mu'tasim" to the novel _The Sacred Fount_ by the 20th-century writer Henry James.

## Analysis

[Borges](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/author/) sometimes comments with a mocking distance, describing himself as an "inept" and "indolent" writer who prefers to write short works rather than "go on for five hundred pages developing an idea." He compares his commentary stories to books by two 19th-century authors: the Scottish historian and essayist Thomas Carlyle and the English novelist and essayist Samuel Butler. Thus Borges puts his work in an international context from the start, giving himself British, English-speaking, Old World forebears. Carlyle's _Sartor Resartus_ comments on the "life and opinions" of the imaginary German philosopher "Herr Teufelsdröckh" ("Mr. Devil's Dung"). Although the commentary pretends to be about the philosophy of clothes, it actually argues the old forms of human belief are dead and new ones are needed. Butler's _The Fair Haven_ pretends to defend Christianity while mockingly undermining its foundational miracles. Borges, therefore, seems to be hinting his own commentary stories have deep aspirations about thought and belief.

# Part 1, Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius : The Garden of Forking Paths | Summary

## Summary

Five years ago the narrator and his friend, Bioy Casares, spent time in a villa where they were disturbed by a mirror at the end of a hallway. Saying "mirrors and copulation are abominable, since they both multiply the numbers of man," Bioy claimed to be quoting one of the heretics of Uqbar and promised to show the narrator the entry on Uqbar, a region in Asia Minor or Iraq, in the _Anglo-American Cyclopaedia_, "a literal if inadequate reprint of the 1902 _Encyclopaedia Britannica_." Finding no entry, Bioy is baffled because he is sure the entry exists.

When Bioy returns home, he examines his copy of the _Anglo-American Cyclopaedia_ in which the entry on Uqbar is the final one in the book. The men recognize few names and references, and the prose has "a fundamental vagueness." The section on Uqbar's literature states its "epics and legends never referred to reality but to the two imaginary regions of Mlejnas and Tlön." Skeptical, the friends go to the national library where they search in vain for any testimony of Uqbar.

Two years later the narrator recalls his father's friend Herbert Ashe. A few days before he died, Ashe had received a book the narrator now possesses. Leafing through it he feels "a sudden curious lightheadedness." Called _A First Encyclopaedia of Tlön, Vol. XI, Hlaer to Jangr,_ its first page is stamped with the words _Orbis Tertius_. The narrator compares this discovery to his discovery of Uqbar "in a volume of a pirated encyclopedia, a brief description of a false country." Volume 11 makes references to other volumes, which may or may not exist, in the _Encyclopaedia of_ _Tlön_.

The narrator explains Tlön's philosophies. People are "congenitally idealist" in that they adhere to the idealist philosophy in which the human mind is the only real thing, or the most real thing of all. The narrator mentions the Irish idealist philosopher George Berkeley, who is credited with the argument material things exist only when someone perceives them. When perception of the thing stops—when the lights go out, for example—the thing stops existing. On Tlön, planet of the radical idealists, Berkeleyism makes perfect sense, for Tlön is focused on creating a philosophy that offers "a kind of amazement," not truth. Thus philosophers "consider metaphysics a branch of fantastic literature" and oppose materialist philosophy, the opposite of idealist philosophy in its belief material things are most real. In describing Tlönian literature, the narrator says Tlönians see all books as written by a single author. In a final evocation of idealism on Tlön, the narrator remarks: "Occasionally, a few birds, a horse perhaps, have saved the ruins of an amphitheater." The birds or horse perceive the amphitheater, maintaining it in existence.

In the 1947 "Postscript" the narrator refers to the first part of the story as an "article ... in the _Anthology of Fantastic Literature_, _1940_." The invention of Tlön is explained in a letter by Gunnar Erfjord, found in a book belonging to Ashe. In the early 17th century a secret society, to which Berkeley belonged, invented a country, Tlön. But the invention turned out to be the work of generations. In the 19th century an American millionaire insisted the project invent a whole planet. The millionaire Ezra Buckley would leave all his money to the project on one condition: "The work will have no truck with the imposter Jesus Christ."

In 1914 the society delivered the "final volume of the _First Encyclopaedia of Tlön_." But the project will continue. The 40-volume _First Encyclopaedia of Tlön_ will be the basis of another work, written in a Tlönian language, to be called _Orbis Tertius_.

In 1942 the narrator is present when a crate shipped from Europe is opened, and among its contents is a compass with letters stamped on it, letters from an alphabet in a language of Tlön. Months later the narrator witnesses a second "intrusion of the fantastic world into the real one." A river has flooded, and the narrator and his friend sleep in a country store. A drunk curses and sings in the night, and in the morning he is dead. A metal cone, small but heavy, has fallen from his belt. The narrator says, "Those small, very heavy cones ... are images of the divinity in certain regions of Tlön."

In a final paragraph the narrator sums up. In 1944 someone found all 40 volumes of the Tlön encyclopedia in a library in Memphis. Some believe the discovery was no accident but guided by "the directors of the still nebulous _Orbis Tertius_." The discovery of the encyclopedias led to a kind of Tlön mania. [Copies](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/themes/#Copies) and commentaries on the encyclopaedias proliferated. Reality became more like Tlön. The narrator comments, "The truth is that it [reality] hankered to give ground." In the 1930s people readily believed in any system of ideas with an "appearance of order," including communism, anti-Semitism, and Nazism. "Why not fall under the spell of Tlön?" asks the narrator.

People are seduced by Tlön's order. But because Tlön was invented by humans, its discipline is "the discipline of chess players, not of angels." The seduction by Tlön changes the world. Academic disciplines are reorganized along Tlönian lines. "Contact with Tlön and the ways of Tlön have disintegrated this world." In the end "The world will be Tlön." Paying no attention to all this, the narrator works on a stylized translation of Sir Thomas Browne's _Urn Burial_.

## Analysis

In this story [Borges](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/author/) proposes a fantastic idea: the discovery of a fictitious planet changes everything on the real planet. Like the best liars Borges makes the fantastic idea believable through details. Not all the meticulous details are details of Tlön, a world that remains shadowy. But the volume of the encyclopedia is meticulously described or, rather, shrewdly judged on its merits: the _Anglo-American Cyclopaedia_ is "a literal if inadequate reprint of the 1902 _Encyclopaedia Britannica_." The reprinted encyclopedia has the typical relationship of a copy to the original; the copied encyclopedia is lesser than the original encyclopedia. By contrast, the fictitious world of Tlön is more powerful than the original, true world.

The stories in _Ficciones_ often display a bewildering erudition. The narrator and his friend Bioy Casares read the encyclopedia entry on Uqbar and recognize only one historical name: "the imposter, Smerdis the Magian." The fifth-century BCE Greek historian Herodotus tells of King Darius of Persia who came to the throne by murdering the reigning prince, Smerdis. Afterward he claimed the murdered Smerdis had actually been an impostor, a Magian named Gaumata. In "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius" the name "Smerdis the Magian" is a throwaway detail, mentioned only once. But it too underlines the theme of the copy. If Darius is to be believed, a copy (the impostor Smerdis) usurped the place of the real (the true prince Smerdis). This is the plot of "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius," in broad outline: a fictional world usurps the place of the real world. Although Tlön is not an exact copy of the world, and indeed is different from Earth, it is a fiction that usurps the place of the real. As the narrator says at the end, "Now, in all memories, a fictitious past takes the place of any other."

Ultimately "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius" shows its devotion to the superiority of the impostor by its emphasis on idealism. For idealists the realm of ideas is more real than the material world. People on Tlön are "congenitally idealist." Thus they would have no problem believing ideas of George Berkeley. The perception of a thing, the perception in the mind, is the only real part of the thing. The narrator takes this notion even further, remarking on the case of a gazing bird or horse keeping an ancient ruin of an amphitheater in existence. (A contemporary building on Tlön would not need the help of animals because people would perceive it day in and day out.) When the world becomes Tlön, as the narrator predicts it will, the inventions of the mind will have taken over the material world.

Another way Borges persuades readers to accept the fantastical story of a secret society spending generations creating a fictitious planet is by inserting himself in the story. Borges gives the narrator's friend the name of his real-life friend Bioy Casares. The fictional first-person narrator is not exactly Borges but shares some details of Borges's life. Many of the stories in _Ficciones_ ground Borges's "notes upon imaginary books" in a first-person perspective. This habit constrains the metafictional tendencies of the stories. They do not become endless funhouse mazes. The stories feature a first-person narrator who speaks as a reader or critic. Therefore, Borges's account of the imaginary writer or book or planet is more credible.

The narrator of "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius" speaks of the impact of Tlön with melancholy. Something alien has infiltrated the real world, and its advance is irreversible and unstoppable: "The world will be Tlön." The nations of Earth will subside, but Tlön will endure. The narration takes on a somber and melancholy quality, as if bidding farewell to things and customs of this world, soon to be replaced by those of Tlön. Although the stories in _Ficciones_ show a preference for idealist philosophies, here it is anticipated as a sad event when Tlön's ideality overtakes and vanquishes the world.

# Part 1, The Approach to Al-Mu'tasim : The Garden of Forking Paths | Summary

## Summary

An unnamed first-person narrator comments on the commentary surrounding the novel _The Approach to Al-Mu'tasim_, by Bombay lawyer Mir Bahadur Ali. Commentators agree the book combines a detective novel with a "mystic undercurrent." _The Approach to Al-Mu'tasim_ was first published in 1932 in Bombay, on cheap paper, in four printings of 1,000 copies each. This edition was followed by an illustrated one titled _The Conversation with the Man Called Al-Mu'tasim: A Game of Shifting Mirrors_.

The protagonist is a skeptical, irreligious law student in Bombay. Born into Islam "he finds himself in the center of a civil tumult between Moslems and Hindus." In the fray "he kills (or thinks he kills) a Hindu." He flees, entering a garden and climbing a tower. At the top of the tower he finds a grave robber. After spending the night in the tower he wakes to find the grave robber has robbed him. The student cannot stop thinking about a woman the grave robber cursed: "a certain _malka-sansi_ (a woman of the robber caste) of Palanpur." He sets off on his way at the end of the second chapter.

Interrupting himself, the narrator continues, recounting how the "incredulous and fugitive student" falls in with "people of the vilest class" and has a strange experience. He perceives "a tenderness, an exaltation, a silence in one of the abhorrent men." These perceptions of clarity, he decides, are traces of one man, Al-Mu'tasim, and he dedicates his life to finding him.

The narrator comments on the plot structure: a man's "insatiable search for a soul through ... subtle reflections which this soul has left in others." The reflections become progressively more refined, from the "vilest" people to a saint to a Persian bookseller. Finally the student arrives at Al-Mu'tasim himself, seated behind a curtain. The book ends before the curtain is drawn and Al-Mu'tasim revealed. The narrator finds the second version of the book sinks into an allegory of "a unitary God who accommodates Himself" to different people's ideas about God. Unimpressed the narrator is captivated by another idea: perhaps "the Almighty is also in search of Someone, and _that_ Someone in search of some superior Someone."

The narrator concludes with several remarks. He thinks the Al-Mu'tasim books could be based on an idea by the 16th-century Jewish mystic Isaac Luria, who believed in reincarnation. The narrator also notes a link to a book called _The_ _Colloquy of the Birds_, by the Persian mystic Farid ud-din Abu Talib Muhammed ibn-Ibrahim Attar in which 30 birds search for a king of birds. In the end they realize they are the bird-king they seek.

## Analysis

Three stories in Part 1 are structured as commentaries on imaginary books. They can be divided in two categories: those about complex ideas and those about a book with a plot too complex for a short story. "[Pierre Menard](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/character-analysis/#Pierre_Menard), Author of Don Quixote" is an example of the former, a story about complex ideas. "The Approach to Al-Mu'tasim" is an example of the latter, and it has the pleasures of plot: adventure, suspense, and jeopardy. Sometimes [Borges](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/author/) presents the plot by summarizing it, thus giving the reader a fast-paced adventure. Other times he merely gestures to a plot too complex to retell: "It is impossible to trace the vicissitudes of the nineteen remaining chapters." Although this story is less known than "Pierre Menard, Author of Don Quixote," it is in some ways more exciting.

Although the story ends before Al-Mu'tasim is revealed, the narrator comments the word _Al-Mu'tasim_ means "the seeker of shelter." The law student who sought Al-Mu'tasim was seeking himself, "the seeker." However, his search has not come to an end. If the sought-after one is a "seeker," the search is endless. The narrator hints at this concept when offering his interpretation: "the Almighty is also in search of Someone, and _that_ Someone" also seeks "some superior Someone."

The narrator compares the law student's search to the poem _The Colloquy of the Birds_, an allegorical poem by 12th-century Persian Muslim poet and Sufi mystic Farīd al-Dīn ʿAṭṭār. In the poem many birds go in search of "the faraway king of the birds, the Simurgh." They travel far, and some birds die along the way, their travels "an almost infinite adventure." When the birds reach the Mountain of Simurgh, they realize the word _Simurgh_ can mean "30" and they themselves are the king they seek. However, this realization brings their search to an end. The law student's search, by contrast, is infinite.

"The Approach to Al-Mu'tasim" is not merely an adventure story. (Although it _is_ an adventure story: the law student is wanted for murder and narrowly escapes by hiding at the top of a Parsi corpse burial tower. He then falls in with vagabonds and criminals as he wanders across South Asia.) It is also a story of ideas, and Borges originally published it in his 1936 essay collection, _A History of Eternity_. Its main idea is a Gnostic one, that a god has imbued human souls with a divine spark. The narrator rejects the idea the Al-Mu'tasim novel is an allegory of a god who accommodates himself to all peoples because it is not "stimulating." This preference reveals the narrator too has a Gnostic bent. "All peoples" are not necessarily worthy or capable of salvation in many Gnostic doctrines. Only possessors of a certain mystical knowledge—intuited or learned—are saved.

One day the law student senses a divine spark in "a tenderness, an exaltation, a silence in one of the abhorrent men" in the lowest ranks of society. From then he searches for that "clarity" in a series of vagabonds, criminals, and beggars. The spark is transmitted in a relationship of reflection. Each of these remarkable individuals the law student encounters is "the reflection of a friend, or of a friend of a friend." The spark has almost nothing to do with whichever "vile man" the law student encounters. The vile man "is not capable" of the clarity he radiates. When the law student senses the spark, says the narrator, now quoting directly from the Al-Mu'tasim novel, "It was as if a more complex interlocutor had joined the dialog." Thus this story of the Gnostic search for a divine spark can also be read as a story of literary history and the transmission of inspiration. The literary spark is not the property of an author's personality or circumstances. It emanates from something "more complex" than the writer or his or her society. Literary beauty the writer does not even seem capable of nonetheless issues from him or her. (Though chiefly, in Borges, from him, since he does not mention any women writers in _Ficciones_.)

# Part 1, Pierre Menard, Author of Don Quixote : The Garden of Forking Paths | Summary

## Summary

The narrator describes the "visible works" left behind by [Pierre Menard](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/character-analysis/#Pierre_Menard): a motley bunch of some sonnets, monographs (scholarly studies of a single topic), translations, a preface, and other short pieces. The other part of Menard's work is "subterranean ... interminably heroic ... peerless [and] unfinished," consisting of two chapters of _Don Quixote_—Chapters 9 and 38—plus a fragment of Chapter 22. Menard's ambition was to write _Don Quixote_—not an update or adaptation but the exact text as Cervantes had written it, word for word. However, Menard did not want to copy Cervantes. Rather the idea was to become a person who would spontaneously produce the same book.

Menard, a Frenchman, was inspired by two texts. The first, a fragment from the 18th-century German writer Novalis, promoted the idea of "_total_ identification with a specific author"—become the author you admire. The second was "one of those parasitic books" that put well-known characters like Hamlet or Don Quixote in contemporary settings. Menard despised such books, but they gave him an idea. "He did not want to compose another _Don Quixote_—which is easy—but _the Don Quixote_."

Writing to the narrator, Menard explains, "My intent is merely astonishing." First he tried to acquire the same knowledge Cervantes had. After achieving "a rather faithful handling of seventeenth-century Spanish," Menard changed his mind. Imitating Cervantes, becoming Cervantes, was too easy. He wanted to "continue being Pierre Menard and ... arrive at _Don Quixote_ through the experiences of Pierre Menard."

Menard thought he would have to be "immortal" to achieve his task. Perhaps that is why he succeeded in writing only two and a half chapters. The narrator says he likes to think Menard did finish and now reads the full _Don Quixote_ as if Menard had written it. Certain lines now sound like Menard's—though of course they are identical.

The narrator wonders why Menard chose _Don Quixote_ and then quotes Menard at length. Menard claims the book is "accidental ... unnecessary." He read it once when he was 12 or 13, and it is as hazy to him as an unwritten book. He also remarks on the time period. In the 17th century it was reasonable and maybe inevitable _Don Quixote_ would be written. In the 20th century it is "almost impossible" for someone to write _Don Quixote_.

The narrator then compares the two books, finding Menard's "more subtle." Cervantes wrote about what was around him whereas Menard chose to write about 17th-century Spain, a remarkable choice in a 20th-century Frenchman. Comparing specific passages, the narrator finds Menard's ideas more astonishing—even though the words are the same. On the other hand, Menard's style is archaic and affected, Cervantes's natural.

Heroic in the narrator's eyes, Menard "undertook a task that was complex in the extreme and futile from the outset." He notes Menard destroyed all his drafts and says Menard believed "to think, analyze and invent" were ordinary human activities. The narrator comments on Menard's legacy, a "new technique" of reading. After Menard it's possible to imagine reading well-known works differently through "deliberate anachronism and erroneous attributions." Thus one would read a work as if it came from a different time, or one would attribute a work to the wrong author.

## Analysis

"[Pierre Menard](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/character-analysis/#Pierre_Menard), Author of the Quixote" is reminiscent of a remark in "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius" in which the narrator says people on Tlön "consider metaphysics a branch of fantastic literature." In [Borges](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/author/)'s hands literary criticism also becomes a branch of fantastic literature. "Pierre Menard" raises questions about what an author is and how meaning is created. The story could have been called "Pierre Menard, Imitator of Don Quixote," but Borges's narrator credits Menard with full originality.

In this story Borges poses a paradox: the copied work is aesthetically superior to the original. This opinion flies in the face of the usual ways of thinking about literary adaptations and other secondary works. Seth Grahame-Smith's 2009 novel _Pride and Prejudice and Zombies_, for example, is seen as a parody of the original, Jane Austen's _Pride and Prejudice_ (1813). Likewise literary criticism about _Pride and Prejudice_, as well as fan fiction set in a Jane Austen 'verse, is seen as secondary to the original work. But Menard does not want to create "another Don Quixote—which would be easy—but _the Don Quixote_." Although Menard rejects secondary status for his work, the story necessarily involves questions about secondary works and secondariness. Menard raises these questions by writing an identical copy of parts of _Don Quixote_.

The story introduces Menard with a catalogue of the 19 literary works he published, apart from _Don Quixote_. They remind readers of Borges's considerable learning and scholarly leanings. There is a monograph on the work of Ramon Llull, a 13th-century Catalan mystic and poet, as well as a monograph on the symbolic logic of 19th-century English mathematician George Boole. Despite the breadth of Menard's works, many are secondary. They are monographs on, translations of, prefaces and answers to others' work. Menard's literary output, therefore, seems derivative or reactive.

In comparing Menard's and Cervantes's versions of _Don Quixote_, the narrator finds Menard's "fragmentary _Don Quixote_ ... more subtle than that of Cervantes." The two works are identical, apart from the fact Menard produced only two chapters. The narrator should not be able to differentiate between the two works, let alone find Menard's subtler. But he does, showing how meaning changes according to who the reader thinks the author is. Thus 17th-century Spain is an uninspired choice of setting for Cervantes, but a stroke of brilliance for Menard. It is subtler for Menard to adopt an artificial idiom—a foreign language of a bygone century—than for Cervantes to write in the demotic tongue of his contemporaries. Likewise their styles diverge in these two identical pieces of writing. Cervantes "handles easily the Spanish of his time," while Menard, the 20th-century Frenchman, has an "archaic style" that "suffers from affectation."

In "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius" the literary critics of Tlön sometimes ascribe two vastly different works to one author, for the pleasure of working out the consequences. Borges's procedure in "Pierre Menard, Author of Don Quixote" is the reverse. He ascribes one work, _Don Quixote_, to two very different writers and in turn produces two different books composed of identical sentences. In a pun, Menard's undertaking is _quixotic_, meaning "foolishly impractical in the service of ideals." Menard's project is quixotic in another sense as well. He shares some of Don Quixote's character traits. In Cervantes's novel (and in Menard's, one assumes) Quixote is an avid reader of chivalric romances, which recount the adventures of knights of old. Though the age of chivalry is past, Quixote sets out to imitate them. He gets himself knighted, acquires some cardboard armor and a broken-down old horse, and goes off in search of adventure. Menard also sets out to imitate a long-ago glory. However, the glory he sets out to imitate is not that of the knights of old but the glory of the famous book about the knight Quixote.

Menard's act of imitation underscores one of Borges's recurring themes, infinity. Cervantes's Quixote imitates knights of old, which he knows of only through books, the chivalric romances he reads. Menard imitates the book about a man, Quixote, imitating books. There is nothing to stop another writer, in some distant century, from attempting to write Menard's 20th-century _Don Quixote._ The structure is potentially infinite, on the model of one of the infinite books proposed in "The Garden of Forking Paths": "a Platonic hereditary work, passed on from father to son." But in the case of Cervantes, Menard, and their descendants, the inheritance would be from writer to writer to writer. And the later iterations might well surpass the earlier ones or the original, just as the narrator of "Menard" insists.

"Pierre Menard, Author of Don Quixote" also touches subtly on the theme of metafiction. The briefest explanation is metafictional literary works call attention to themselves as fictions or artifices. The book-within-the-book or play-within-the-play is a typical self-referring structure of metafiction. One of the most famous examples appears in Shakespeare's _Hamlet_. The character Hamlet watches a play very much like _Hamlet_, within the play _Hamlet_. As Borges well knew, _Don Quixote_ also has metafictional aspects. In Book 1, Part 2, Chapter 2 of Cervantes's novel, Don Quixote and Sancho Panza learn a book has been written about their adventures. Its author is not Cervantes but an invented character named Cid Hamete Benengeli. Nonetheless Quixote and Panza are aware of themselves as literary characters from that point on.

Borges explains his attraction to the metafiction of _Don Quixote_ in the essay "Partial Enchantments in the _Quijote_," published in _Labyrinths_. He asks why it bothers readers "that Don Quijote be a reader of _Quijote_." He answers if a fictional character can become a reader of such a work, then "we, its readers ... can become fictitious." For Borges Cervantes's _Don Quixote_ is another example of what he calls "the contamination of reality by dream." Menard's text overtakes Cervantes's, since the narrator now cannot avoid reading the entire book as if written by Menard. With Menard's _Don Quixote_ readers again realize they might be fictitious.

#  Part 1, The Circular Ruins : The Garden of Forking Paths | Summary

## Summary

At night a lone man arrives at his destination, a temple in a jungle. The circular temple contains a statue of something like a tiger. The man sleeps until the next day. He knows downstream lie the circular ruins of another temple, dedicated "to gods now burned and dead." The man has a goal, and he must dream as part of accomplishing that goal. Near midnight he awakens and realizes some men have been "spying respectfully on his sleep." The man's goal is to create a man by dreaming of him.

After some chaotic dreams, he dreams of an amphitheater full of students where he lectures on "anatomy, cosmography, and magic." Realizing he can "expect nothing from those pupils who accept his doctrine passively," he has higher hopes for students who sometimes disagree with him. One day he dismisses all the students but one, "a taciturn, sallow boy" who resembles him. The boy makes progress, but then "catastrophe" strikes: the man sleeps dreamlessly and then suffers insomnia.

He considers the difficulty of making the material of dreams into something. It is harder than "weaving a rope out of sand or coining the faceless wind." Then one day, after a month's hiatus, he utters a spell, some "prescribed syllables" and goes to sleep. He dreams of something "warm, secret, about the size of a human fist." It is the heart of the man he is dreaming. He continues to dream. "Within a year he had come to the skeleton and the eyelids." Finally he dreams "an entire man," a young man, but unable to sit, talk, or open his eyes.

The narrator compares the dreaming man's work to a story from "the Gnostic cosmogonies" with Demiurges, or lesser gods, creating "a red Adam," a failed, feeble Adam that cannot do anything. The dreamed-up man is like the failed Adam. The man prays to the tiger statue and that night dreams the statue comes to life as a fiery tiger and a fiery colt and "a bull, a rose, and a storm." This "multiple god" is named Fire and is worshipped. The god says he will animate the dreamed-of man. Thus only the element of fire and the man himself will know the dreamed-of man is a phantom. The god says the dreamer should instruct the dreamed-of man and then send him to the other temple to perform rites. Then the man dreams his dreamed-of man wakes up.

Now the narrator calls the dreaming man "the wizard." Attached to his creation the wizard spends two years teaching the dreamed-of man how to perform the rites to the god Fire and delays by spending more time dreaming.

He starts to think of the dreamed-of man as his son, setting tasks for his son to do in the real world. Then the wizard kisses his son and sends him off to the circular ruins. But first he destroys his son's memory of his apprenticeship. He does not want his son to know "he was a phantom." With his son gone the wizard gets bored. He bows to the tiger statue and wonders if "his unreal son" is doing the same at his circular ruins. The wizard's perceptions begin to diminish. He hears and sees less because "his absent son is being nourished by the diminutions of his soul."

Years later two oarsmen waken the wizard and tell him about "a charmed man in a temple of the North," who can "walk on fire without burning himself." The wizard remembers the god Fire said only fire would know his son was a phantom. Now the wizard worries his son will find out he is a phantom. The wizard thinks this knowledge would be humiliating.

Then his worries end. He sees certain natural signs, such as the sky taking on "the rose color of a leopard's gums" and a flight of birds suddenly taking off. He understands something that happened centuries ago is repeating itself: the ruins of the sanctuary of the god Fire have burned, and "death was coming to crown his old age and absolve him from his labors." He walks into the fire, which does not burn him. "With relief, with humiliation, with terror," he realizes "he also was an illusion, that someone else was dreaming him."

## Analysis

The title "The Circular Ruins" refers both to the ruined temple to which the dreamed-of man is sent and to the circular structure of the story. The wizard who set out to dream a man—to create him in dreams—turns out to be the product of someone else's dream. Thus the end foretold for the wizard's creation turns out to be the wizard's own end: immolation by the god Fire. Similarly the dreaming man has always protected his creation from the knowledge he is a creation: "to a projection of another man's dreams—what an incomparable humiliation, what madness!" Therefore, humiliation is one of his feelings when he realizes he too is a dream: "With relief, _with humiliation_, with terror," he understands someone else has dreamed him.

[Borges](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/author/) neatly achieves the circularity of "The Circular Ruins." He has the wizard worry about his creation, the man now in the distant temple. Thus when the wizard looks at the sky—"the sky took on [a]rose color"—the smoke referred to next seems to be the smoke of the distant temple, "the other ruined temple ... downstream." Logically this is the order in which events are presented: color of fire in the distance, then smoke, then flames. But the flames engulf the wizard himself, although they do not burn him. At nearly the same moment the wizard realizes he is an illusion, subject to the one weakness of his creation—fire—the reader, too, realizes the wizard is an illusion. The creator, like the dreamed-of man, is invulnerable to fire. Fire is both men's "weakness" in that the fire god knows they are figments. "The Circular Ruins" is also circular in that the wizard realizes "what had happened many centuries before was repeating itself."

The story also can be read in terms of artistic creation. Through great mental effort the wizard creates a man. But the created man is only half alive; he cannot move or open his eyes. Only the intervention of a god animates the wizard's creation. This process might be considered similar to the creation of literary characters in the writer's imagination. Effort might dream them up, but only inspiration makes them come alive. A fictional character is a fragile entity, initially existing only in the writer's mind. Thus in the story's epigraph from _Through the Looking Glass_, Tweedledee has just told Alice the Red King is dreaming about her. He then asks the question that forms the story's epigraph. "And if he left off dreaming about you, where do you suppose you'd be?" Alice believes she would be unchanged, for like the wizard and the dreamed-of man in "The Circular Ruins," she does not think she is someone else's creation. But Tweedledee answers she would be "nowhere" if the dream ended; in other words, she would no longer exist. "The Circular Ruins" also provides an answer to this question, a more complicated answer. Writers create other writers, just as the wizard, created by someone, is also a creator. And writers, it turns out, are themselves creations, like the wizard. Creation does not proceed out of nothing. Borges too might be someone else's dream, since he is able to dream up characters. Or the sense of "dream" could be understood more prosaically, in that Borges's writing is in a dialogue with the work of other writers.

Further, the dream of dreaming a man through nothing more than ideas is also to dream without women, or physical birth. More than an allegory of ideally immaterial birth, the story is an account of literary heritage as patrilineal. Each (male) writer turns out to have been engendered in dreams by another male writer.

The story also reflects Borges's emphasis on idealism. The events are mystical, not realistic. However, the wizard's process of dreaming causes the products of his mind to exist in the real world. No action better exemplifies idealism than the creation of a real human being through nothing but thoughts. As is typical for Borges, the procedure becomes circular. The man who thought his thoughts could become real things turns out also to be "an illusion ... someone else was dreaming him."

The narrator of "The Circular Ruins" says the Gnostics tell of Demiurges creating "a red Adam," a failed Adam who cannot move or think. At first the dreamed-of young man is like this failed Adam who cannot move until he is infused with an animating spirit from the god Fire. The dreaming man who creates him is, therefore, something of a Gnostic Demiurge. The story is also an allegory in which a Demiurgic creation stands for the perils and joys of artistic creation. These perils and joys are emotionally intense. The wizard seeks to prevent his son from the "humiliating" knowledge he is a creation. This humiliation is the negative mode of a writerly exaltation, the sense the writer has succeeded in "dreaming a man" (or a character). In a typical Borgesian twist the creator in "The Circular Ruins" discovers he himself is the dream of another creator. Rather than just being a puzzle, however, this moment of discovery has an emotional resonance. Now the "humiliating" knowledge he wanted to protect his son from has been visited upon the writer himself. Thus the writer realizes "with humiliation, with terror... that someone else was dreaming him." But surrendering to this knowledge is also ecstatic. Therefore, the writer accepts this truth, not only "with humiliation, with terror," but also "with relief."

# Part 1, The Babylon Lottery : The Garden of Forking Paths | Summary

## Summary

The first-person narrator describes the fortunes and misfortunes that have befallen him. He has been proconsul, "like all men in Babylon." He has also been a slave, "like all men in Babylon." These and other fates have been visited on him by the Babylon lottery.

Centuries ago the lottery was like other lotteries, which the narrator describes as failed. "The moral virtue was nil," he says. The first improvement to the lottery was the addition of "adverse outcomes." Some ticket holders would have to pay fines. Now the lottery interested people.

Losing players refused to pay the fines and took jail sentences instead, intending this refusal as a blow against "The Company," the organization running the lottery. The next step in the lottery's evolution was no more fines, only jail sentences for unlucky ticket holders. Soon the lottery had other prizes and fines, none related to money. The Company "multiplies the stakes."

Poor people felt excluded from the exhilarating game of "terror and hope," because they couldn't afford lottery tickets. The situation encouraged theft. The Company was thus forced to "accept complete power," and the lottery became "secret, free, and general." Tickets were no longer sold for money. Every "free man" who reached the age of majority participated. The actions of the Company were secret. A lucky ticket might lead to a man's "elevation to the council of the magi." An unlucky ticket might lead to "mutilation, dishonor of many kinds, death itself." Each drawing determined a man's fate until the next drawing.

People still complain about the lottery. They deposit their complaints in special places thought to lead to the Company, including "a sacred privy called Qaphqa." The Company replies via a scribbled piece of paper left in a mask factory. If the lottery contains errors, the Company says, those are also the workings of chance and so part of the lottery. The mask-factory declaration has led to a theoretical discussion. Some say if the lottery is about infusing chance into life, chance should intervene at all stages of the lottery. They point out the contradiction between chance determining death but law prescribing the manner of death.

The narrator then summarizes the reforms. He asks readers to imagine a lottery determines someone should die. A drawing then determines nine possible executioners. Then another drawing determines the one actual executioner and then a drawing that replaces the death sentence with a lucky prize. Still another drawing might make the death sentence worse. In conclusion, says the narrator, "the number of drawings is infinite." With the lottery, "No decision is final, all diverge into others."

The narrator remarks there are also "impersonal drawings," with mysterious purposes. One drawing might call for a "bird [to] be released from a tower roof." Another might stipulate "a grain of sand be withdrawn (or added) to ... a certain beach." These drawings sometimes have "terrifying" consequences.

Finally no one knows which events and objects result from the lottery. An ancient relic could be a fake implanted by the lottery. A death could be a murder ordered by the Company, or not. Even impostors who believe they are resisting the Company could be doing the work of the secretive "Company." Masked heretics make this radical announcement: "_the Company has never existed, and never will_."

## Analysis

Although the idea of this wide-ranging lottery may seem like fantasy, in ancient Athens judges and other officials were selected by lottery. Indeed, it has been argued the practice of selection by lottery is more democratic than election by voting. In the Athenian judge lottery everyone is equal, just as in [Borges](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/author/)'s Babylonian lottery "all men" participate. Borges's use of the word _men_ points to a restriction in this imaginary Babylonian society. Athenian citizenship was restricted to free men, excluding slaves and women, and the Babylon lottery seems likewise restricted. But Borges takes the "The Babylon Lottery" further than as a tool for democratic rule.

Usually fate and chance are opposite ideas: either one does something because one is fated, or one does something by chance. The lottery delivers fates, but it delivers them by chance. On its most refined level, the lottery seems like a working-out of a chaos theory, the study of apparently random behavior in complex, rule-governed systems. That is, chaos theory brings apparent chance, or seemingly random behavior, under the control of rules or deterministic laws. The classic example of chaos theory is following the chain of cause and effect by which the flapping of a butterfly's wings results in a typhoon on the other side of the globe. In "The Babylon Lottery" there are "impersonal drawings of undefined purpose," such as a lottery decreeing a bird be released from a tower roof. In keeping with the intertwining of chance and law in chaos theory, "the consequences [of the trivial drawings], sometimes, are terrifying." Although they are never mentioned specifically, the implication is they are more than personal consequences, for prison terms and death have already become lottery results.

At least part of the story can be read as an allegory of the decay of religious belief. In the real world, beginning in the Renaissance, secularism turned attention away from religion—a shift from belief in an all-powerful God to the belief God does not exist. In "The Babylon Lottery" a phase of intense doubt follows a phase of intense belief. The lottery and the Company become enormously powerful, and their power endures. The reform of the lottery toward greater complexity is said to have been "the practice of centuries." But the "infinite" lottery gives rise to a radical doubt: "_the Company has never existed and never will_."

The narrator seems to be an exile or expatriate from the country he describes. At the least he is traveling. In the first sentence he identifies himself as a Babylonian: "Like all men in Babylon ..." But he soon reveals he is not recounting these events in Babylon: "I come from a vertiginous country where the lottery forms a principal part of reality." That sentence could be spoken only somewhere other than in Babylon. Moreover the narrator is on the move again: "I have little time left ... the ship is ready to sail." Borges does not indicate where the narrator is going or why, leaving the reader to wonder whether the narrator is leaving by choice or whether the lottery is sending him away or calling him back. Such uncertainty matters because the story encourages readers to ask themselves the same kinds of questions: have I chosen my path, or was it determined by a secret lottery? If this concept seems an overreach, readers may consider the foreshadowing Borges provides on the story's first page. The narrator offhandedly says people in other countries do not know the lottery, or else it "operates among them imperfectly and in secret."

# Part 1, An Examination of the Work of Herbert Quain : The Garden of Forking Paths | Summary

## Summary

The writer Herbert Quain has just died in Ireland. The narrator thinks the obituaries in _Times Literary Supplement_ and other newspapers do not do Quain justice, comparing him with Agatha Christie and Gertrude Stein.

The narrator discusses Quain's first book, _The God of the Labyrinth_, as similar to a detective novel and reveals its plot from memory. In the first pages "an indecipherable assassination takes place." The middle is occupied with "a leisurely discussion." The end offers "the solution." However, the offered solution is wrong, says the narrator. Those who reconsider the book discover another solution.

Then the narrator describes the "regressive, ramified" (having branches) novel _April March_. The title shows its backward movement, with the months March and April arranged in reverse order. The plot is "retrograde," moving backward. The novel's 13 chapters resolve into three separate plots with three chapters each. Quain says, "I lay claim in this novel ... to the essential features of the game: symmetry, arbitrary rules, and tedium." The narrator says the quality of some of _April March_ is "sacrificed to a rage for symmetry." Thus Quain is more of an experimenter than a writer of passion, as he has said.

The narrator describes another of Quain's works, "the heroic comedy in two acts, _The Secret Mirror_." In the first act there are wealthy people, including a playwright, a general, and the general's daughter in addition to "a nightingale and a night" and a secret duel. In the second act the same characters reappear but with different names, and a sense of menace prevails in which "everything becomes slightly horrible, everything is postponed or frustrated." _The Secret Mirror_, the narrator reports, was a success largely because it was misinterpreted as a "Freudian comedy." Quain, however, was used to failure and not happy about being successful for the wrong reasons.

He then wrote a work called _Statements_, which the narrator describes as "the most original of his works, doubtless the least praised and the most secret." From this book of eight stories, the narrator reveals, "I was ingenuous enough to extract from the third ... my story of 'The Circular Ruins.'"

## Analysis

The ending reveals the first-person narrator is a fictitious [Borges](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/author/), but real author of "The Circular Ruins." This revelation comes as Borges comments on fictitious writer Quain's final book. Thus Quain is a kind of distorted reflection of Borges. Like Borges the fictitious Quain is intrigued by labyrinths, publishing a book called _The God of the Labyrinth_. Like Quain Borges wrote a collection of eight stories, _The Garden of Forking Paths_ (1941 and later appearing as the first part of _Ficciones_). Although Quain seems to be Borges's double, he is in some ways the anti-Borges, or the shadow Borges. Quain wrote a book of stories called _Statements_, and years after the story about Quain Borges published the 1944 collection _Ficciones_. Borges also claims Quain influenced him in the writing of _The Garden of Forking Paths_. He "extracted" from a story of Quain's his own story "The Circular Ruins." Quain is Borges's "secret mirror," to use the title of Quain's most successful work.

Because Quain is Borges's reflection, his fictitious criticisms of Quain seem to be about himself, Borges, as well. In his fictitious critical commentary he finds Quain's books "over-anxious to astonish." Several of Borges's stories in _Ficciones_ build up to an ending meant to astonish. For example, the end of "The Garden of Forking Paths" reveals the true motive of the murder. The end of "The Circular Ruins" reveals the dreaming wizard is himself a creation of dreams. These plots do astonish and may refer to real critics' comments. Can the same be said about Herbert Quain's as described in this story? The answer might depend on how taken a reader is with the possible permutations in Quain's novel _April March_ with its nine possible endings—or nine beginnings since the novel proceeds backward.

Quain is also a distorted reflection of Borges, or an anxious one, in that he is not well known or particularly successful. (When Borges wrote this story he was not yet an internationally renowned writer himself.) The terms in which the narrator defends Quain's reputation can be applied to Borges. For example, Quain's play _The Secret Mirror_ is misunderstood as a "Freudian comedy," a misunderstanding that makes the play a success. _The Secret Mirror_ is a kind of mirror; the second act reflects the first in a distorted way in which "everything becomes slightly horrible, everything is postponed or frustrated." If this fictitious play were a "Freudian comedy," it would have the characteristics of what psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud called a "repetition compulsion." Freud believed trauma causes people to repeat the scene or events of whatever traumatized them. The horror, for Quain and for Borges, would mean the elaborately constructed repetitions of the play would become internal to someone's mind. The source of repetitions for Freud is in the mind. For Quain the repetitions of _The Secret Mirror_ are probably part of a refutation of time.

Quain is interested in British idealist philosopher Francis Herbert Bradley (1846–1924). The narrator reveals Quain's prologue to his nine-endings novel _April_ _March_ "evoke[s] the inverse world of Bradley, in which death precedes birth, the scar [precedes] the wound." Because Borges claims Quain has influenced him, it is possible to see Quain as the original and Borges as the reflection. Here too the later precedes the earlier, as Borges's secret mirror Quain creates him.

# Part 1, The Library of Babel : The Garden of Forking Paths | Summary

## Summary

The first-person narrator describes "the Universe (which others call the Library)," made of six-sided galleries containing 20 bookshelves. It is not known how many galleries there are; perhaps there are infinitely many. Each gallery has two tiny private rooms for the librarian's use: a bedroom and a bathroom. The narrator is one of the "men of the Library." He says he traveled in his youth, meaning he traveled to other parts of the Library. Now he is old and expects to die soon. After he dies, other librarians will "hurl [him] over the banister." He expects his tomb to be "the unfathomable air" and his fall "infinite."

All the Library's books have 410 pages. Each page has 40 lines and each line roughly 80 letters. The narrator interrupts his description to state certain axioms or principles. The first axiom: "The Library exists _ab aeterno_." The Latin _ab aeterno_ means "since forever" or "from an infinitely remote time in the past." He adds imperfect humankind "might be the work of chance or malevolent Demiurges [lesser gods]." But the Library—he calls it the universe—"can only be the work of a god."

The second axiom: "_The number of orthographic symbols is twenty-five_." A footnote from another writer explains the 25 symbols include 22 letters, the period, the comma, and the space. The Library's identically sized books are seemingly random combinations of these 25 symbols. Thus all books are "formless and chaotic." One book consists of the letters "MCV" repeated to fill the 410 pages. Another is "a mere labyrinth of letters," but written on its last page is "_O Time your pyramids_."

The librarians have had different opinions about the books' meanings. Some thought the books were in an ancient language. Although different areas of the Library have different dialects, this theory has been rejected. Others thought the books were in code.

About 500 years ago a librarian found a book containing two pages of what seemed like sense. Librarians debated about which language the passage was written in. It was found to be "a Samoyed-Lithuanian dialect of Guarani, with classical Arabic inflections." One knowledgeable librarian declared every book in the Library to be unique, and travelers have confirmed this. He then deduced "the Library is total," and its books contain "everything which can be expressed, in all languages." The reaction to this statement was joy, initially. All librarians believed they possessed "a secret, intact treasure." No matter what the problem, somewhere the Library had a book with the solution. Now, four centuries later, there are official searchers or Inquisitors, but "no one expects to discover anything." Depression reigns.

New beliefs arise in reaction to the failure to find the hoped-for books. Some decide to "write" books themselves, composing them by chance combinations of letters. Others decide to "eliminate useless works." These librarians hope to reach a "Crimson Hexagon" where the books are "of a smaller than ordinary format, omnipotent, illustrated, magical." Many mourn the loss of the destroyed books, but the narrator points out two things. One, humans cannot make that much of a dent in the infinite Library. Two, since the Library is infinite, there are always "several hundreds of thousands" of near-copies or facsimiles, which differ only by one letter or comma.

Some believe in a kind of ultimate book, "the cipher and perfect compendium of _all the rest_." This book is "analogous to a god" and the mythical librarian who has read this book is known as "the Man of the Book." The narrator has spent years in search of things like this. The narrator discusses other, similar philosophical issues. He believes "this useless and wordy epistle"—the story he is narrating—already exists somewhere in the Library. So does a book that tells the opposite of his story. He also wonders how one knows what words mean; maybe readers of this narrative are mistaken about its meaning.

"The present condition of men" in the Library is despairing. The population of librarians has decreased because of "epidemics, heretical disagreements, the pilgrimages which inevitably disintegrate into banditry." There is also a wave of suicides. The narrator thinks "the unique human species" might be going extinct, but the Library "will last on forever." He believes it is infinite, in a special sense: "_limitless and periodic_." After a certain period the disordered, chaotic books are all repeated, and the repetition creates order from disorder. The librarian finds this belief an "elegant hope."

## Analysis

The epigraph to the story comes from Richard Burton's _The Anatomy of Melancholy_, a 17th-century English treatise on "melancholy" or depression. Burton quotes from his vast learning, including classical Latin. Part 2 of Burton's book concerns the ways to treat melancholy. One of the best cures, Burton writes, is study, and he advises studying combinations of "the 23 letters" (these are the 23 letters in the classical Latin alphabet). The quotation in full, which [Borges](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/author/) does not give, is as follows:

>  By this art you may contemplate the variation of the twenty-three letters, which may be so infinitely varied, that the words complicated and deduced thence will not be contained within the compass of the firmament; ten words may be varied 40,320 several ways. 

The "art" Burton mentions is the art of contemplating the whole thing by way of a part, "_ex ungue leonem_," as Burton says. These words are part of a Latin expression meaning "we may judge the lion by its claw." Thus one cure for melancholy is to take a limited part, the 23 letters, and contemplate an immense whole, a treasury of words more numerous than the stars.

In this story Borges has done something similar. The books in the Library are combinations of 25 "orthographic symbols": 22 letters, the period, the comma, and the space sign. (There are 22 letters in the Hebrew alphabet.) From this small part, the 25 symbols, Borges calculates an immense whole, a Library containing every possible book. As contemporary American philosopher Daniel C. Dennett has pointed out, the number of books in this Library is far greater than the number of atoms in our universe. One question the story does not answer is whose sorrow occasioned this contemplation of the 25 symbols. The sorrow might be the narrator's. It is also worth noting the atmosphere of suicidal despair and even violence in "The Library of Babel." As at the end of "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius" where the fictitious world is compared to dialectical materialism, anti-Semitism, and Nazism, the Library's fanatical devotion to order descends into violence and destruction—the suicides and the tearing up of books.

The librarian in the story also judges "_ex ungue leonem_," deducing the whole from the part. He has seen a part of the universe, the hexagonal galleries and connecting walkways of the Library. He reasons there is nothing else to the universe. Other librarians, too, use the words _universe_ and _library_ interchangeably. In a realistic story this librarian-narrator would have to be insane. The Library described is not possible. For example, one passage in a book is analyzed as being written in "a Samoyed-Lithuanian dialect of Guarani, with classical Arabic inflections." No such language could spontaneously come together in our universe—Guarani is a language native to Paraguay and Samoyedic languages to northern Siberia. This is not a problem in the Library of Babel, however, where linguistic combinations seem to come together randomly. But more than that, with what signs could "classical Arabic" be written? The limited alphabet of the "The Library of Babel" could not write in classical Arabic. The Library's combinations of signs are ideal, unconstrained by geography and history. In this respect the Library's limitless expanse may recall how Tlön invaded and occupied the narrator's reality. In Borges's stories a world can be built from a logical proposition. Borges can't stop toying with these idealist propositions, but they also seem to generate considerable anxiety about their implications.

The 22 letters of the books in "The Library of Babel" recall the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet. The oldest known Hebrew text is the _Sefer Yetzira_ (Book of Creation), which explains how God created the universe from the 10 divine numbers and the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet. The Book of Creation is important to Kabbala, a variety of Jewish mysticism. These allusions perhaps explain why the books in the Library are mystical combinations of letters rather than constructions based on words and sentences. An editor intervenes in the narrator's text to explain the 25 symbols. The editor says the "present note" in the story was written by "an unknown author." Thus it is possible the narrator's prediction has come true: "this useless and wordy epistle [the narrator's story] itself already exists" somewhere in the Library.

"The Library of Babel" may have some autobiographical elements to it. Borges worked for nine years as a cataloguer in a suburban library. His fellow librarians were not booklovers. Borges later wrote they cared only about "horse races, soccer and smut." He later referred to this period as "nine solid years of unhappiness," and that is the mood of "The Library of Babel," wracked with book destruction and suicides.

The tragedy of the Library of Babel is that its infinite wealth of symbols produces almost nothing meaningful. One of the few exceptions is the brief string of words, "O Time your pyramids." The line is a nearly exact quotation from Borges's poem "Of Hell and Heaven" (1942). But even this is only a snippet, not an entire book. The books imagined by the more theoretically inclined librarians are entrancing: vindications of individual lives; magical, illustrated books; and the "Man of the Book," who has seen the book containing all the other books in the Library. But the actual books they stumble on are either nonsensical or useless, such as a vindication of the lives of future or imaginary people. The problem of the Library of Babel is similar to the problem of [Ireneo Funes](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/character-analysis/#Ireneo_Funes), the main character in "Funes, the Memorious." The prodigious memory cannot forget any detail long enough to form a concept. The Library of infinitely combined letters lacks larger units of sense, as does its namesake the biblical Tower of Babel. Building stopped when God intervened by introducing foreign languages so workers could no longer understand each other and who soon scattered throughout the world no longer speaking a common language. At the end of "The Library of Babel" the narrator clings to the hope the Library's disorder, repeated, can become order. He advances the proposition the Library is "limitless and periodic." At some point the disorderly combinations on the shelves will repeat themselves "in the same disorder." This repetition of disorder "would constitute an order: Order itself." The idea of the "limitless and periodic" is a repeated figure in Borges. It is in the circularity of "The Circular Ruins" and in "The Approach to Al-Mu'tasim," in which every sought-after mage turns out to be another seeker. It is possible this hope for order relates to the pursuit of invention and astonishment in _Ficciones_. The tension between order and astonishing inventiveness—in "The Babylon Lottery," especially—animates the whole short story collection.

# Part 1, The Garden of Forking Paths : The Garden of Forking Paths | Summary

## Summary

During World War I Dr. Yu Tsun, formerly an English teacher in Tsingtao, China, hangs up the phone, ending a conversation with Captain Richard Madden. Yu Tsun, the narrator, thinks Madden's presence in the office of Viktor Runeberg means Runeberg has been killed or arrested, and Yu Tsun, a German spy in England, believes he too is under threat.

To reflect on the possibility of his death Yu Tsun retreats to his room and thinks about how one's experience is limited to oneself in the present. "Things happen only in the present," he thinks, "and all that really happens happens to me." Madden does not yet know Yu Tsun "possess[es] the Secret—the name of the exact site of the new British artillery park on the Ancre" (a river in France and the site of a British victory in 1916). He wants to find a way to let the Germans know the name of this site before he is captured and executed as a German spy.

He goes through his possessions, including "a revolver with a single bullet." He quickly thinks of a plan to get the name of the site to his chief in Berlin and in the telephone directory locates the name of "the only person capable of passing on the information." This man lives "in a suburb of Fenton" (in England, where Yu Tsun also is). Yu Tsun then explains his motives for spying and carrying out his plan. He "did not do it for Germany," which he considers "a barbarous country," and he finds the role of spy "degrading." Instead he did it to prove an Asian man could save his chief's armies and to escape from Captain Madden.

He heads to the "village of Ashgrove" but buys a ticket "for a station further on," to conceal his destination. As the train leaves, he sees a man running "furiously, but vainly, the length of the platform." It is Madden. Yu Tsun thinks "the duel had already started" and believes he has won the first round "by an accident of fate." He presents arguments to himself to prove he is capable of ultimate victory over Madden, but looking ahead he is pessimistic. He believes "new abominations" will occur every day, and "soon only soldiers and bandits will be left." He offers advice: whoever has to do "some atrocious enterprise should act as if it were already accomplished." Such a person should act as if the future were "as irrevocable as the past."

At Ashgrove Yu Tsun disembarks. Some children, unprompted, direct him to [Dr. Stephen Albert](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/character-analysis/#Dr._Stephen_Albert)'s house, telling him to keep turning left as he advances along the road. Their advice reminds him of "the common formula for finding the central courtyard of certain labyrinths." He reveals he is the great-grandson of Ts'ui Pên, governor of Yunnan province who retired "to write a novel ... and to create a maze in which all men would lose themselves." A stranger assassinated Ts'ui Pên 13 years later. No one understands his novel, "and nobody ever found his labyrinth." Thinking about the lost labyrinth, Yu Tsun also thinks about patriotism. He decides a man can be "an enemy of other men" but not an enemy of a country: "not of fireflies, words, gardens, streams, or the West wind."

Behind Albert's iron gate is a summer house or pavilion. Chinese music issues from it. A man approaches from the main house, carrying a paper lantern and speaks to Yu Tsun in Chinese, assuming him to be a representative of a Chinese consul named Hsi P'eng. He also assumes Yu Tsun has come to see the garden of forking paths. The startled Yu Tsun reveals he is the descendant of Ts'ui Pên, creator of the garden.

The man is Stephen Albert, and he invites Yu Tsun into his house, filled with European and Asian books. Formerly a missionary in China Albert "aspired to become a Sinologist," an expert on China. They talk about Ts'ui Pên. Aware he must make an "irrevocable decision," Yu Tsun thinks he can put it off. Madden cannot arrive in less than an hour.

Albert reveals he has figured out Ts'ui Pên's labyrinth: it is Ts'ui Pên's novel, "an invisible labyrinth of time." He says the clue was Ts'ui Pên's desire to make an "infinite" labyrinth, which could not be just a physical labyrinth. He shows Yu Tsun a letter written by Ts'ui Pên: "I leave to various future times, but not to all, my garden of forking paths."

Albert has seen ways to make a book infinite. It could be circular, with the last page of the novel being the same as the first; or recursive and metafictional, like _The Thousand and One Nights_; or hereditary, with each new generation adding something. But Ts'ui Pên's will was Albert's clue. In most books, Albert says, a character makes a choice. In Ts'ui Pên's novel the character "chooses—simultaneously—all" alternatives. In doing so the character "_creates_ various futures." He gives an example in which a character, Fang, chooses to kill an intruder and chooses not to. He makes an analogy with himself and Yu Tsun. "In other possible pasts you are my enemy; in others my friend."

Albert remarks the novel was a "despised" genre "in Ts'ui Pên's period" and thus another clue that an illustrious man would spend 13 years on a despised genre. A further clue was the novel never referred to the garden of forking paths. A riddle can't have its answer in the question, he says, and Yu Tsun agrees. So the novel that is a labyrinth of time never uses the word _time_. "To eliminate a word," says Albert, "is perhaps the best way of drawing attention to it."

Summing up, Albert says _The Garden of Forking Paths_ is Ts'ui Pên's image of the universe: "an infinite series of times." Albert poses various permutations of their present encounter. In some Yu Tsun is the enemy. Yu Tsun feels an anxious "pullulation," a swarming or multiplying, of "invisible people" and asks for another look at the letter. As Albert rises and turns his back, Yu Tsun shoots and kills him.

Yu Tsun hurriedly recounts the rest of his story, saying it is "unimportant." Arrested by Madden, Yu Tsun has been condemned to hang. But "I have yet triumphed!" he says. The "secret name of the city to be attacked got through to Berlin." The city's name was Albert, and news of Yu Tsun's arrest for the murder of Stephen Albert communicated it to Germany. He thinks the chief already figured this out, but the chief does not know "of my infinite penitence and sickness of heart."

## Analysis

In "The Garden of Forking Paths" both [Dr. Stephen Albert](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/character-analysis/#Dr._Stephen_Albert) and Dr. Yu Tsun are familiar with possible worlds theory, which maintains the universe is composed of many worlds. One is actual and the others possible. Philosophers have used possible worlds theory to theorize modal logic. Propositional logic is the logic of statements, which are true or false, such as the statement (or proposition) "My name is [Borges](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/author/)." Modal logic adds expressions like "probably" to the true or false judgment. Narratology, the study of narratives, has used possible worlds theories in ways similar to Borges's. Italian author and critic Umberto Eco (1932–2016) describes literary texts as "machine[s] for producing possible worlds." In Eco's view each literary text contains not just _one_ possible world (named Narnia or Middle Earth), but many possible worlds. He describes three classes of possible worlds in fictional texts:

- possible worlds imagined and written by the author
- possible worlds imagined by the characters
- possible worlds imagined by the reader in the course of reading (for example, imagining what will happen next)

Like many literary texts "The Garden of Forking Paths" has examples of all three types. But it is particularly rich in possible worlds of the second type. Ts'ui Pên is an author, and he creates a possible world in that he writes a novel. However, Ts'ui Pên's novel is unique; at every turn in the plot the novel presents all possible outcomes as chosen. Any character in the novel "chooses—simultaneously—all of them."

In this story Borges also makes intricate twists in the third type of possible world, the worlds imagined by a reader who wonders what happens next. Suspense, tension, and surprise in a story have to do with the relationship between the story and this third type of possible world. In the course of the story the reader's assumptions turn out to be proved or disproved. At first it would seem the story will hold few if any surprises. The first page identifies the criminal and announces the crime: a spy will pass on information to his unseen chief. In any such story, such as a heist movie, if the reader or spectator does not know the plan at the outset, the plan will succeed. If the reader does know the criminal's plan—if the criminal explains it first—the plan will fail, or it will have to change to succeed. Therefore, a savvy reader knows from the start Yu Tsun's plan, whatever it is, will succeed. The reader also knows Yu Tsun's motive, which he explains at the start. With this story Borges shows how much suspense can be wrung from the reader's not knowing _how_ the plan will succeed. The suspense of what happens next and the possible worlds imagined and discarded by the reader along the way concern how Yu Tsun will pass along the information. As Borges says in the prologue to Part 1, "The Garden of Forking Paths" is a detective story in which the reader is the detective.

However, from another perspective the element of suspense is not the point of "The Garden of Forking Paths." From this perspective the suspense falls away as the story progresses. Instead the story's forking paths reveal unexpected dimensions to this "espionage thriller" narrative. The dazzling parts of the story are in the labyrinth and not in Yu Tsun's fate. What Yu Tsun learns about his ancestor's literary labyrinth intimates a staggering array of possibilities. This one particular world, in which the narrator's mission will affect the world at war, pales by comparison.

In "Three Versions of Judas," which appears in Part 2, the narrator remarks most vices contain a trace of virtue: "In adultery ... tenderness and self-sacrifice; in murder, courage; in ... blasphemy, a certain satanic splendor." In that story Judas chooses the vices "unvisited by any virtues: abuse of [trust] ... and informing." Of Yu Tsun in "The Garden of Forking Paths" a reader might say spying contains traces of ingenuity or cleverness. But Yu Tsun also chooses villainous acts: he abuses his host's hospitality and, by extension, the hospitality of England. This is underlined when Yu Tsun shoots Stephen Albert in the back, the act of a coward. There is also crafty deceit in Yu Tsun's final words to Albert. Claiming "I am your friend," he asks to see the letter again, thus getting Albert to turn his back. But "The Garden of Forking Paths" is not about condemning villainy. As American literary critic Paul de Man wrote about Borges's infamous villains, "The artist [Borges] has to wear a mask of the villain ... to create a style."

#  Part 2, Prologue : Artifices | Summary

## Summary

[Borges](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/author/) introduces the stories in Part 2 with a left-handed compliment, saying these are "less torpidly executed" than those in Part 1, _torpid_ meaning "lacking in energy, or dull." Borges singles out two stories for special mention: "Death and the Compass" and "Funes, the Memorious." He says "Funes, the Memorious" is "a metaphor of insomnia" and describes "Death and the Compass" as set in "a Buenos Aires of dreams."

Borges adds a postscript, dated 1956. He has included three more stories in Part 2: "The End," "The Sect of the Phoenix," and "The South." "The End" contains one fictional character, Recabarren. Everything else is "implicit in a famous book." He describes the task he set for himself in "The Sect of the Phoenix": to reveal gradually the ordinary fact at the heart of the story's secret. He regards "The South" as "perhaps my best story." It can be read as a narrative "and also in another way." Finally he lists the authors he "continually rereads": 19th-century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer; 19th-century English essayist and critic Thomas De Quincey; 20th-century Viennese philosopher Fritz Mauthner; and 19th-century English author Robert Louis Stevenson, best known for _Treasure Island_ and _The Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde_. Also in the list are Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw; English critic and author G.K. Chesterton, known for his detective novels featuring the priest-sleuth Father Brown; and Léon Bloy, a 19th- and 20th-century French writer and convert to Catholicism.

## Analysis

[Borges](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/author/) sounds a little like one of his characters—an English gentleman with an aristocratic disdain for boasting, perhaps. Apart from the dry remarks about his own fiction, Borges offers surprising insights. "Funes, the Memorious" is not obviously a story about insomnia. But Funes cannot forget; he cannot forget the multifarious details of the world long enough to form a general concept—a nation, a dog, a person. Forgetting could also be seen as a key to sleep during which one withdraws from the world, forgetting its claims. Funes is incapable of this too: "To sleep is to be abstracted from the world." Funes in his bed imagines "every crevice and every molding of the ... houses around him." These thoughts also make Funes a universal figure in a way he does not seem to be at first. Few people have Funes's memory, but many have felt for one night the difficulty of being "abstracted from the world."

Borges identifies Recabarren as the only thing he invented in the story "The End." Everything else in the story, he says, is "implicit in a famous book," the epic poem _The Return of Martín Fierro_ by José Hernández, a sequel to Hernández's epic poem _The Gaucho Martín Fierro_. Fierro is the hero of both poems and a character most Argentine readers would recognize. The guitarist is a minor character at the end of the sequel. Borges's use of Hernández's characters is an example of Borges's transfictional methods. Transfictionality refers to moving characters, plots, or settings from one fictional work to another.

Borges's list of the writers who influence him is odd. They are overwhelmingly English (with some Central European philosophers thrown in) rather than Argentinean or Spanish. They are lesser-known writers and philosophers, or ones who write in the lesser genres, such as Stevenson with his adventure tales or Chesterton with his detective fiction. As American novelist and essayist William H. Gass points out, Borges does not claim affiliation to the giants among writers of English such as Henry James, Herman Melville, or James Joyce. As in the list of minor works Borges gives to his characters Herbert Quain, [Pierre Menard](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/character-analysis/#Pierre_Menard), and [Jaromir Hladík](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/character-analysis/#Jaromir_Hlad%C3%ADk), Borges claims a minor and quixotic tradition as his forebears.

# Part 2, Funes, the Memorious : Artifices | Summary

## Summary

The first-person Argentinean narrator recalls a deceased Uruguayan friend, [Ireneo Funes](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/character-analysis/#Ireneo_Funes). His written recollections will be gathered with those of others for a kind of memorial book. One writer has called Funes a superman. The narrator points out Funes was "a countryman [peasant] from the town of Fray Bentos."

The narrator recalls his first youthful meeting with Funes in 1884. He and a cousin were returning from a horseback ride. Funes was smoking a cigarette. The cousin asked Funes the time. Without consulting a watch, Funes replied, "In ten minutes it will be eight o'clock." Impressed by Funes's answer, the cousin told the narrator about Ireneo Funes. He was known for his eccentricities, including "having nothing to do with people and always knowing the time, like a watch." He was the son of "an ironing woman," and an English doctor named O'Connor. Others disagreed and named a different father.

In 1887 the narrator's family returned to Fray Bentos, in Uruguay. The narrator asks about news of "the chronometer Funes" and learns he was thrown from a horse and is "hopelessly crippled."

The narrator has begun teaching himself Latin and has brought with him some Latin books, including a volume of Pliny's _Natural History_ (written in 77–79 CE). Funes sends the narrator "a flowery, ceremonious letter," in which he recalls details of their meeting years before. He concludes by asking to borrow any of the narrator's Latin books and to send a Latin dictionary, "for I do not know Latin as yet." Thinking Funes is pulling a prank, the narrator sends a language instruction book, _Gradus ad Parnassum_, and the volume of Pliny.

Recalled to Argentina, the narrator realizes Funes still has the books and goes to Funes's house before leaving. As he walks to the back where Funes lies in the dark, he hears Ireneo speaking Latin, reading something aloud "with obvious delight." Later he learns Funes was reading a chapter of Pliny's _Natural History_ about memory. The narrator quotes the chapter's last words: "_ut nihil non iisdem verbis redderetur auditum_" (Nothing that has been heard can be retold in the same words.). Funes welcomes the narrator and recounts "the cases of prodigious memory cited in the _Historia Naturalis_." Funes describes his life before the accident. "He had been ... blind, deaf-mute, somnambulistic, memoryless." The narrator tries to point out Funes already had a remarkable mind and tries to describe the sharpness of Funes's memory. He could remember "the shapes of the clouds in the south at dawn on the 30th of April of 1882." He tells the narrator, "_I have more memories in myself_" than all of humanity has had "_since the world was a world_."

Typical people can recall basic shapes, but Funes could recall "the tempestuous mane of a stallion" or "the many faces of a dead man during the course of a protracted wake." He also invented a new way of counting, giving every integer a new name. His name for 7,013, for example, was "_Màximo Perez_"; his name for 7,014, "_The Train_." The narrator argues Funes's invention was not a "system of enumeration," but "Funes did not understand me, or did not wish to understand me."

The narrator recalls an invention proposed by the 17th-century English philosopher John Locke: a language with a word for every individual thing. Instead of one noun, _bird_, every individual bird would have its own word. Coming up with a similar idea, Funes "renounced it as being too general, too ambiguous." For Funes there is the added complication of remembering each time he has seen "or perceived or imagined" each thing.

To the narrator Funes's proposed projects "reveal a certain stammering greatness" and let typical people imagine what it is like to be Funes, who is "almost incapable of general, platonic ideas." He has difficulty realizing "the generic term _dog_ embraced so many unlike specimens of differing sizes and different forms." But he has a further difficulty. He has a hard time believing a dog seen "at three-fourteen (seen in profile)" has the same name "as the dog at three-fifteen (seen from the front)." Further "without effort, [Funes] had learned English, French, Portuguese, Latin." But the narrator thinks Funes was perhaps "not very capable of thought." The narrator says thinking means "to forget a difference, to generalize, to abstract."

The conversation ends as dawn breaks. The narrator sees Funes's 19-year-old face, but "he seemed as monumental as bronze, more ancient than Egypt, anterior to the prophecies and the pyramids." Funes dies at age 21, in 1889.

## Analysis

Even before the accident there is a sense [Ireneo Funes](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/character-analysis/#Ireneo_Funes) is ill-fated. Funes bears his mother's last name, not his father's. He is an illegitimate child and thus has had a difficult start in life. The literary critic Gene H. Bell-Villada points out the name _Funes_ is similar to several Spanish words meaning "'funereal,' 'ill-fated,' and 'dark.'" Indeed, it is dark when the narrator and Funes first meet; the narrator can make out only Funes's clothes and lit cigarette. Knowledge is usually associated with light—hence the words _illuminate_ and _enlightenment_. But Funes's strange intellectual gifts imprison him in darkness. He prefers to lie in the dark, the better to shut out the teeming, ever-shifting details of his "intolerably exact" world. He is also metaphorically imprisoned in darkness because he cannot form general ideas. In many ways he cannot think but can only perceive and remember in stunning detail.

The American philosopher Saul Kripke thinks names are a special class of words, calling them "rigid designators." According to this idea, no matter what happens to the bearer of the "designator" Ireneo Funes—whether he grows up to be a rich athlete or a paralyzed savant—the name Ireneo Funes always refers to the same person. In a way names are, therefore, like the general concepts Funes is unable to form. Funes would like to use names in a way opposite to Kripke's; with every change he would like objects to have a new name.

Funes represents an extreme of nominalism, a branch of philosophy that flourished in the Middle Ages. Nominalist philosophers believed there was no real thing behind such universal concepts as "humanity" or "the Good." This belief does not mean nominalists denied the words _humanity_ and _good_ had a meaning. They denied only the existence of something like a Platonic form of "humanity" or "the good." Funes goes further: there are only individual things at specific times. General concepts have no meaning for Funes.

The narrator mentions John Locke "proposed (and rejected) an impossible idiom." _Idiom_ means "language" here, but the emphasis is on individuality: only one group or even one person understands an idiom. Locke's proposal was a language in which "each individual object, each stone, each bird and branch had an individual name." In his "Essay Concerning Human Understanding" Locke rejects this language for two reasons: it is impossible, and it is useless. Such a language is impossible because a name for "every bird and beast men saw; every tree and plant that affected the senses, could not find a place in the most capacious understanding." It would take a "prodigious memory" surpassing all other known examples of prodigious memory. Such a language would also be useless. "Men learn names, and use them in talk with others, only that they may be understood," wrote Locke. "This cannot be done by names applied to particular things; whereof I alone hav[e] the ideas in my mind." This is precisely Funes's problem. He would like a language even more precise than Locke's in which there is a name not just for every leaf but for every leaf as it appeared at the different times Funes saw it. But such a language could be meaningful only to Funes, the one who saw the leaf on those occasions. His numbering "system" is equally incommunicable, a long list of peculiar names, too long for anyone but Funes to learn.

However, Funes does have a desire for simplification, even though he is unable to simplify on a conceptual level. He finds it difficult to sleep because he cannot "abstract [himself] from the world." But when he does sleep, he achieves it by orienting himself toward some "new unknown houses" to the east. He has not seen the houses—which would lock them into unbearable detail. So he is free to imagine the houses as "black, compact, made of a single obscurity." This is another instance of the sadness of Funes's "intolerably exact" world: its only joys are infrequently obtained states of oblivion. As if his "rigid designator" of a name had fated him to it, Funes soon departs for the eternal dark, dying at age 21.

# Part 2, The Form of the Sword : Artifices | Summary

## Summary

The narrator recalls his encounter with "the Englishman of La Colorada," a man with a scar on his face. While the narrator travels "in the Northern provinces," a flood forces him to spend the night at the Englishman's villa. The Englishman turns out to be Irish. The narrator and his host eat supper together and then have drinks. Drunk, the narrator asks him about the scar, and the host tells the story.

Now the first-person narrator, the Irishman says in 1922 he was in Connaught, in northwestern Ireland. He and other Catholics and Republicans (those seeking a free Irish republic) "were conspiring for independence" One night [John Vincent Moon](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/character-analysis/#John_Vincent_Moon), "a comrade from Munster," Ireland, joined them. Moon was 20 years old, "thin and soft at the same time" and reminded the Irishman of an invertebrate. He was a dedicated communist who read a lot and enjoyed arguing. The Irishman found him narrow-minded, for "he reduced universal history to a sordid economic conflict."

Moon and the Irishman went out in the night, arguing about communism. Passing some British soldiers, Moon became "fascinated and eternalized ... by terror" of the soldiers and paralyzed by fear. The Irishman had to turn back and yank Moon out of the way. The soldiers fired at them, and hit Moon. At the narrator's temporary lodgings, a manor house belonging to General Berkeley, the Irishman dressed Moon's superficially wounded shoulder. The next day Moon was back to his old ways, reading and arguing. When the Irishman told him their colleagues to the south were expecting them to help in battle, Moon said he felt "a shoulder spasm." The Irishman saw Moon's "irreparable" cowardice.

For the next nine days the narrator engaged in battle by day and returned to the house at night. Moon remained there, playing the invalid and offering opinions about military strategy. On the 10th day the narrator's side lost. The unnamed city fell to "the Black and Tans," the British in the Royal Irish Constabulary. (The Black and Tans fought against the Irish Republican Army to keep Ireland under English rule.) Returning home the narrator overheard Moon talking on the telephone, betraying his host in return for "certain guarantees of personal safety."

The narrator says at this point his story grows confused. He chased Moon through the house. With a cutlass shaped like "a stellar half-moon" the Irishman cut Moon's face, marking it. Then the Irishman says the first narrator's name, [Borges](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/author/). He breaks off the story, but Borges asks him for more. He says Moon fled to Brazil with his "Judas money" and then asks, "Don't you see the mark of infamy written on my face?" He says he told the story from the other man's perspective so Borges would listen. But he himself is John Vincent Moon.

## Analysis

The story is set in Ireland in 1922. On December 6, 1921, Ireland signed a treaty with the United Kingdom, establishing an Irish Free State and supposedly bringing the Anglo-Irish war to an end. However, Irish republicans were dissatisfied with the terms of the treaty. For one thing, the treaty required an oath of allegiance to the British Crown. Therefore, the strife did not come to an end. On December 6, 1922, the Irish Free State established by the treaty came into existence. So the bitter fighting the "Irishman" in the story remembers takes place in the year between the signing of the treaty and its implementation.

Moon comes in for more criticism from [Borges](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/author/) than does any other character in _Ficciones_. He is a coward and an ardent communist. His cowardice gives the lie to his communistic ideals of brotherhood and equality. He also uses his efforts as a communist intellectual to evade the hard work of fighting. He stays home and formulates scientific Marxist opinions on how the battle should be waged, while keeping himself well out of danger. None of the other traitors, heretics, and even murderers in _Ficciones_ show themselves so contemptible as Moon. Although many of Borges's stories in _Ficciones_ champion the philosophy of idealism, political idealists appear to be another matter altogether for Borges.

It seems as though a personal dislike, or deeply felt anti-communism, animates Borges's depiction of this character. In fact, Borges was anti-communist. When Moon speaks confidently of the coming revolution's assured victory, the story's other Irishman reproves him: "Only lost causes can interest a gentleman." It is hard not to hear Borges the aristocrat in these words. "The Form of the Sword" bears the date 1942. The following year a military coup brought Juan Perón to power in Argentina. In 1946 Perón would fire Borges from his library post for having supported the Allies during World War II. If he had read "The Form of the Sword," Perón the populist might have fired him for that too.

Borges himself once criticized "The Form of the Sword" as being nothing but a "trick story." Its complicated form of double narration does indeed seem to exist to do only two things: pillory communists and set up the surprise ending. Knowing the "Englishman of La Colorada" is really Moon, readers can determine whether Moon has somehow changed. He pitches in tirelessly, shoulder to shoulder with the laborers on his land: "the Englishman worked alongside his _peones_." In that way he is still the old Moon, friend of the working man. But he is also a wealthy landowner. At night the peon goes to his hut and Moon to his hacienda. He has perhaps abandoned the communist ideals of his youth. But in being a hypocrite he is still the same Moon who sold out his fellow fighter in 1922.

#  Part 2, Theme of the Traitor and the Hero : Artifices | Summary

## Summary

The narrator describes a plot he has invented and then gives an abbreviated account of the story he might write. Its setting could be "some oppressed and stubborn country: Poland, Ireland, the Republic of Venice" or elsewhere. Choosing Ireland in 1824 the narrator calls the protagonist Ryan, great-grandson of the heroic, martyred, assassinated Irish leader Fergus Kilpatrick, whose grave was "mysteriously violated." Fergus was a "conspirator" and a leader who "perished on the eve of victory." He "was assassinated in a theater," his killer unknown.

Certain details of the crime puzzle and fascinate Ryan. He sees similarities to Julius Caesar and portents in a fire at his great-grandfather's birthplace. These details lead him to believe in "a secret pattern in time." He thinks about others who have proposed a pattern to history: the French historian Condorcet; the German philosopher G.W.F. Hegel; the historian Oswald Spengler, who wrote _Decline and Fall of the West_; and others. He also thinks about reincarnation, "the transmigration of souls." These ideas are "circular labyrinths." Another labyrinthine puzzle is the last man to speak to Fergus. A beggar said something to him, and his words were "prefigured" in Shakespeare's _Macbeth_. Ryan is amazed "history should imitate literature." Ryan discovers Fergus's oldest comrade, James Alexander Nolan, translated Shakespeare's play _Julius Caesar_ into Gaelic. Nolan had also worked on some theatrical spectacles in Switzerland, in which whole communities restaged historic events.

A solution presents itself to Ryan: Fergus's murder was a kind of theatrical spectacle involving "the entire city" and spread over many days. In August 1824 the conspirators met to discuss finding a traitor in their midst. Fergus tasked Nolan with finding the traitor. Nolan then discovered Fergus was the traitor. But exposing Fergus would be bad for the rebellion. In remorse Fergus said he would cooperate in making his death look like martyrdom so the people would be inspired to greater acts of courage. This act would allow him "to redeem himself" and "add a flourish to his death."

In a hurry Nolan plagiarized some ideas and lines from Shakespeare. "The public—and the secret—presentation took several days." Fergus's activities in the days before the assassination, and the things he said, all were part of the theatrical presentation of his martyrdom. Everything was planned, even the "prearranged words" the dying "traitor and hero" tried to choke out "between two effusions of violent blood." Ryan concludes Nolan foresaw his, Ryan's, discovery of the plan and accounted for this discovery. Therefore, Ryan does what he assumes is his part in the plan. He keeps quiet.

## Analysis

The "traitor and hero" of the story's title are the same person, Fergus Kilpatrick. Unlike the surprise ending of "The Form of the Sword," this story reveals Kilpatrick's double role early on. At first Ryan thinks he has discovered a pattern in history: Fergus Kilpatrick is somehow the repetition of Julius Caesar. This idea threatens to pitch Kilpatrick into "circular labyrinths" as history repeats itself endlessly. The narrator then says Ryan's next theory "plunges him into labyrinths even more inextricable."

At first the claim seems exaggerated. What is so labyrinthine about a political leader styling himself after Shakespeare's _Julius Caesar_? Kilpatrick certainly could have read the play. But Ryan's investigation uncovers something like a vast, 19th-century version of _The_ _Truman Show_, a 1998 movie about a small town that turns out to be nothing but an elaborate soundstage. All but one of the townspeople are actors. So, too, Kilpatrick's colleagues and hangers-on, even a random "mendicant" in the street, are all part of the scheme. In keeping with [Borges](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/author/)'s interest in the "contamination of reality by dreams," real history has been influenced by a staged event. "Dreams" are able to contaminate reality when they arrive in the form of ideal systems, like the artificial, overwrought interpretation of Kilpatrick. As in "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius," ideal systems, language and literature, dreams and fictions can influence reality.

Ryan resembles many a conspiracy theorist: he sees an assassination and concocts an interpretation. In Ryan's interpretation Kilpatrick's assassination is full of nuanced meanings. To compare Ryan to a "conspiracy theorist" has negative implications. It is possible the search for nuanced meanings in the chaotic texture of reality causes Ryan's thinking to become deranged. In any case, Ryan's Kilpatrick is a torn man, simultaneously traitorous and remorseful, self-dealing and self-sacrificing. Ordinary history has only a simple Kilpatrick, a one-dimensional hero, loyal to the end. Ryan's traitorous Kilpatrick betrays even his act of treachery, becoming a hero again in the end, at great cost to himself. Kilpatrick's dual identity makes him similar to the version of Judas proposed in "Three Versions of Judas." In that story, too, an interpreter takes an infamous man—Judas—and gives him a double nature. As the narrator of that story remarks, the new interpretation of Judas "added to the concept of the Son, which seemed exhausted, the complexities of calamity and evil." For Borges this ambiguous, double nature is an enrichment. As the narrator of "[Pierre Menard](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/character-analysis/#Pierre_Menard), Author of Don Quixote" remarks, "ambiguity is a richness."

#  Part 2, Death and the Compass : Artifices | Summary

## Summary

Master detective [Erik Lönnrot](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/character-analysis/#Erik_L%C3%B6nnrot) foresees but does not prevent the last in a "staggered series of bloody acts." Although he fails to guess the identity of the killer, he interprets the secret form of the crime and "the participation of Red Scharlach, whose alias is Scharlach the Dandy." The narrator backs up and tells how it all began.

The first crime happens at the Hotel du Nord in an unnamed city. Dr. Marcel Yarmolinsky is in town for the Third Talmudic Congress on December 3. He has a room near "the Tetrarch of Galilee." (A tetrarch is a local ruler.) On December 4 Yarmolinsky does not answer a phone call from the _Yiddische Zeitung_ [Yiddish newspaper] and is found dead in his hotel room, a stab wound in his chest.

Lönnrot and [Commissioner Treviranus](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/character-analysis/#Commissioner_Treviranus) enter the room to investigate. The editor of the _Yiddische Zeitung_ is also there. Treviranus proposes a theory. A thief trying to steal some sapphires from the Tetrarch of Galilee entered Yarmolinsky's room by mistake. Yarmolinsky surprised him, and the thief killed him. Lönnrot admits the motive is possible but rejects it as "not interesting." He says even if reality is not interesting, hypotheses have to be. "Here lies a dead rabbi," says Lönnrot. "I should prefer a rabbinical explanation" and dismisses Treviranus's "imaginary robber" idea.

In the hotel room Lönnrot sees Yarmolinsky's books: works on Judaism, mysticism, and the history of the Hasidic sect of Judaism. Lönnrot takes the books to study them, while Treviranus says he is a Christian and scorns the books as "Jewish superstition." The editor of the _Yiddische Zeitung_ quips Christianity is also a Jewish superstition. A police agent in the room finds a piece of paper on which is written "_The first letter of the Name has been spoken_."

On January 3 a second, similar crime occurs. A dead man is found on a deserted street. Naked except for a large cape, Daniel Simon Azevedo, a former political operative turned thief, has been stabbed in the chest. Nearby, written in chalk, are the words "_The second letter of the Name has been spoken_."

On February 3 the third crime occurs. Someone giving his name as Ginzberg calls Commissioner Treviranus saying he can explain the murders of Yarmolinsky and Azevedo in return for money. But "the discordant sound of whistles and horns" drowns out his voice, and the connection goes dead. The call is traced to a pub called Liverpool House whose owner, Black Finnegan, says the call was made by a lodger named Gryphius. Gryphius was last seen leaving the pub with two short people dressed as harlequin clowns and speaking Yiddish. Gryphius and the harlequins left in a cab. As they went, one harlequin scrawled on the wall of a shed, "_The last of the letters of the Name has been spoken_."

Treviranus examines Gryphius's room, noting a Latin book about Hebrew philology. Treviranus summons Lönnrot to the scene. As they leave, they discuss the case. Lönnrot reads a passage underlined in the Latin book, translating it as "_the Hebrew day begins at sundown and lasts until the following sundown_." Newspapers discuss the case, some proposing it is "an anti-Semitic plot." The "illustrious gunman" Red Scharlach says such crimes never happen in his district, the South.

On March 1 Treviranus receives a letter signed "Baruj Spinoza" saying there will not be a fourth crime on March 4, and the three previous crime scenes form an equilateral triangle. The letter includes a map illustrating the triangle. Treviranus sends the letter and the map—"a piece of insanity"—to Lönnrot who studies them and announces he has solved the crime. The next night the criminals will be in jail and adds they are indeed planning a fourth crime. On a train to the villa Triste-le-Roy, site of the next crime, Lönnrot thinks about the case, now uninteresting to him: "mere circumstances, or reality ... and penal proceedings."

Lönnrot enters the estate of Triste-le-Roy, a symmetrical building. He explores "antechambers and galleries, [and] ... duplicate patios." He is "infinitely reflected in opposing mirrors," thinking the size of the house is an illusion enlarged by shadows, by "_the symmetry, the mirrors, the years, my ignorance, the solitude_." Finally he enters an observatory and confronts Red Scharlach. Lönnrot asks Scharlach if he is looking for "the Secret Name." Scharlach tells him he is looking for "something more ephemeral and slippery, Erik Lönnrot." He explains why he seeks revenge. Three years ago Lönnrot arrested Scharlach's brother. In the tumult Scharlach was shot and spent nine days near death, wracked by fever. "An Irishman" tried to convert him to Christianity. He grew to hate his body and its symmetries. Now seeing the world as a labyrinth in which "all roads lead to Rome," he has created a labyrinth to ensnare Lönnrot. The components of the labyrinth are "a dead writer on heresies, a compass, an eighteenth-century sect, a Greek word, a dagger" and the rhomboid shapes of a paint shop.

Then Scharlach explains. On Scharlach's orders Azevedo tried to rob the Tetrarch. But Azevedo blundered into Yarmolinsky's room and killed him to silence him. At the time of the killing Yarmolinsky had just written, "_The first letter of the Name has been spoken_." Ten days later Scharlach read Lönnrot was studying Yarmolinsky's Hebraic library for clues. So Scharlach studied similar books. Then he killed Azevedo and scattered mystical Jewish clues all around. He knew Lönnrot would know there had to be four crimes, because _Tetragrammaton_ means the four letters of the name of God, the only four that can be written. Scharlach planned everything to lure Lönnrot "to the solitude of Triste-le-Roy."

Looking at the rhomboid shapes in the windows Lönnrot thinks about "periodic death" and tells Scharlach they might be destined to meet again. Next time Scharlach should set up a labyrinth made of a straight line, not a square or rhomboid. Scharlach agrees to do so "the next time I kill you." He adds the straight line is an "invisible and everlasting" labyrinth. He then shoots and kills Lönnrot.

## Analysis

Lönnrot is styled after some of the classic crime-solvers of detective fiction, particularly Edgar Allan Poe's Auguste Dupin and Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes. Dupin and Holmes were gentlemen with no need to work as detectives for money; they were men of leisure who solved crimes for the pleasure of the intellectual exercise. Lönnrot, like Dupin and Holmes, draws on his vast learning and makes pronouncements that bewilder those with lesser minds. Yet [Borges](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/author/)'s detective is more of a parody of these men, for his intellect causes him to be wrong and ultimately killed.

[Commissioner Treviranus](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/character-analysis/#Commissioner_Treviranus) plays a role similar to Inspector Lestrade in the Sherlock Holmes mysteries. Treviranus is the literal-minded police detective who sees things in an ordinary light. Like Lestrade Treviranus proposes a commonplace solution for the murder of Yarmolinsky: a thief aiming to rob the Tetrarch blundered in and killed Yarmolinsky as a cover-up. Just as Holmes would, Lönnrot dismisses this theory. But Lönnrot gives an odd reason for doing so: Treviranus's theory is "not interesting." Lönnrot prefers "a purely rabbinical explanation; not the imaginary mischances of an imaginary robber." In fact, in an instance of situational irony, Treviranus has solved the case already. The true explanation of Yarmolinsky's murder exactly follows Treviranus's commonplace account. Thus "Death and the Compass" draws on the tradition of classic detective fiction while also mocking the infallible detective.

The cleverest, and thus most interesting, character in the story is Red Scharlach. Perhaps in a nod to the Sherlock Holmes mystery _A Study in Scarlet_, Scharlach's name means "scarlet" in German. Although Scharlach has ordinary criminal aims—money and revenge—he is smart enough to pretend to be a super-villain with elaborate schemes that need intellectual interpretation. Wanting money in the form of the Tetrarch's sapphires, he sees a chance to plot revenge on Lönnrot. Thus Scharlach is a double criminal; he is himself and he plays the mastermind of Lönnrot's imagination.

Scharlach's lair, the villa at Triste-le-Roy, signifies its owner's doubleness and duplicity. With the complete symmetry, every architectural feature has a corresponding double. When Lönnrot enters the first thing he sees is a statue of a "two-faced Hermes." Hermes was the ancient Greek messenger god. In this function Hermes lent his name to the study of interpretation, hermeneutics. Hermes is not usually depicted as having two faces, however, and Scharlach calls the same statue a "double-faced Janus." The statue represents the crime's double interpretations: the commonplace and the "rabbinical," or Treviranus's interpretation and Lönnrot's. There are also two rabbinical interpretations. One follows up on clues relating to the number three and solves the crime as ending with the creation of the equilateral triangle. Chief among these "three" clues is the date; the murders happen on the third day of the month, though no one is murdered at crime site number three. The other interpretation follows up on all the clues relating to the number four and assumes the series concludes when the fourth letter of the name is written. The Tetragrammaton, the name of God, has four letters. Ginzberg supplies the information Jewish days are reckoned from sundown to sundown, so all the crimes in fact occur on the fourth of the month. Ultimately both interpretations—the one with threes and the one with fours—are false, or at least fictional, concocted by Scharlach. Every time Lönnrot deduces something from his abstruse learning, he is thinking only what Scharlach thinks he would think.

Lönnrot and Scharlach are also doubles in a way. Lönnrot seizes on the books in Yarmolinsky's room, thinking the solution must be there because the solution must be "interesting." Scharlach reads similar books in imitation of Lönnrot. So Scharlach's scheme mirrors Lönnrot's thoughts. As in other stories in _Ficciones_, the double overtakes the original, and Scharlach outwits Lönnrot. Since Lönnrot is undone by his pursuit of the more interesting, "rabbinical" interpretation of the crime, perhaps is a judgment of some kind on the (intellectual) risks or dangers of a certain kind of close interpretation.

#  Part 2, The Secret Miracle : Artifices | Summary

## Summary

On March 19, 1939, in Prague, Czechoslovakia, [Jaromir Hladík](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/character-analysis/#Jaromir_Hlad%C3%ADk) is arrested by the Nazis. Hladík is an ambitious but unproductive writer. He has written but not finished a tragedy _The Enemies_. He is charged with being Jewish, signing a petition against the Nazis, and making a "Judaizing" study of the 16th-century German Christian mystic Jakob Böhme. All the charges are true. The Nazi investigator, Julius Rothe, finds Hladík's name attached to a translation in a publisher's catalogue and is thus convinced the arrested man is important and must therefore be executed. His execution is set for the morning of March 29.

Hladík reacts with "horror." He spends nine nights in jail awaiting his execution. Imagining his execution again and again, he reasons things never turn out the way one imagines, so he hopes imagining his execution might be the same as preventing it. In line with this principle, he spends his days in jail "invent[ing], _so that they might not happen_, the most atrocious particulars." He then imagines he is immortal and invulnerable, so long as the 29th has not yet dawned. He tries to hold onto time, but every night he slips into sleep.

On the 28th he thinks about his tragedy in verse, _The Enemies_, and about his intellectual and literary career. He doesn't think much of his other works, except a philosophical work, _Vindication of Eternity_. The first volume of that work gives the history of the ways other thinkers have envisioned eternity. The second "denies ... that all events in the universe make up a temporal series." Although some arguments claim "a single repetition" is enough to refute time, they are flawed and perplexing.

Hladík thinks _The Enemies_ is his best chance of "redeem[ing] himself from his equivocal and languid past" in which he wrote mediocre works. _The Enemies_ begins with the clock striking seven. A complex plot unfolds, and at a certain point the clock strikes seven again. "The time of day has not advanced," a character in the play notices. The first speaker in the play reappears and repeats the first line.

Hladík still needs to write the next two acts. He addresses God, asking for one more year in which to finish his play. Hladík falls asleep on his "last ... most atrocious night." Although he wants to stay up, sleep sweeps "over him like a dark ocean and drown[s] him." He dreams he is in a library, looking for the one book containing the letter that stands for God. Someone enters carrying an atlas. Hladík looks at a map in it and hears a voice say, "The time for your work has been granted." Hladík wakes up.

He is brought outside to face the firing squad. The soldiers have a casual attitude. It is 8:45, and it seems important to execute Hladík at nine on the dot, so Hladík is forced into an undignified wait. The hour arrives, and the soldiers line up. The sergeant gives the command to fire. Then "the physical universe" stands still. The sergeant's arm remains raised. A puff of smoke remains stationary. The soldiers do not move. A drop of water lies motionless on Hladík's cheek.

Hladík considers various possibilities: perhaps he is mad or dead. After a full day of thinking he realizes his wish has been granted. He is motionless, but he can think. In his mind he finishes writing _The Enemies_, working steadily, adding, refining, and adjusting. He "grows to love the courtyard, the barracks." As Hladík finishes _The Enemies_ time begins again. The drop of water rolls down his cheek and the soldiers' bullets strike him. The narrator adds Hladík "died on March 29, at 9:02 in the morning."

## Analysis

[Jaromir Hladík](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/character-analysis/#Jaromir_Hlad%C3%ADk) seems to be a writer after [Borges](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/author/)'s own heart.

Hladík is past 40, as Borges was at the time he wrote this story.

The idea of stopping on the brink of an execution also recalls the story "An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge" by 19th-century American writer Ambrose Bierce. In that story a soldier in the Confederate army is sentenced to hang. As the rope breaks, he plunges into the water and makes his way home. But at the end of the story he is hanging from the rope, dead. His escape is a hallucination. In "The Secret Miracle" it is difficult to tell whether Hladík's reprieve is real or not. He cannot move or speak. No one witnesses Hladík's extra year of life; the people around him are frozen. He doesn't finish _The Enemies_ on paper or send it out into the world. His miracle occurs only in his mind, as he writes without pen or paper.

Hladík is also one of the more extreme idealists in _Ficciones_. He lives for literature: "the problematic practice of literature constituted his life." Indeed, Hladík lives in his mind. While in the cell he imagines the way to the execution site will be "a labyrinth of passageways, stairs, and connecting blocks." On the day of the execution he finds "reality was less rewarding"—only "a single iron stairway." With regard to his own literary output, too, Hladík focuses on the imaginary—his planned but unfinished works. The narrator gently mocks Hladík for this, though he says every writer judges other writers by their finished works, and themselves by "what [they] conjecture or plan" to write. The abrupt, imminent death is a crisis for such a writer. Hladík does not want to die, but he especially does not want to die a failed writer.

However, an "idealist" is not just someone with their head in the clouds. It is a philosophical position, and Hladík is an idealist in matters of time. The miracle Hladík experiences—unless it is a dream or hallucination—is of time stopping and then resuming. But his own intellectual and literary work is concerned with time repeating. These seem to be opposed concepts. Wouldn't it be neater, more symmetrical, if Hladík's miracle were the proof of his own ideas about time repeating? The connection between time stopping and time repeating is in Hladík's book _Vindication of Eternity_. Its second part is about denying "that all the events in the universe make up a temporal series." In this book Hladík argues "a single 'repetition' suffices to demonstrate that time is a fallacy." While standing before the frozen firing squad, unable to tell whether he is mad or dead, Hladík continually recites "the mysterious fourth Eclogue of Virgil." At the start of the fourth eclogue, Virgil, the ancient Roman poet and author of the _Aeneid_, invokes a cyclic time: "the majestic roll / Of circling centuries begins anew." The play Hladík is writing in his head, as he lives an extra year on the brink of death, is about a repetition in time.

However, because these intellectual deliberations are confined to Hladík's head, it is impossible to know whether his miracle really occurs. Does he, alone, live an extra year? Or does he hallucinate the experience? The narrator notes Hladík died "at 9:02 in the morning." His execution was scheduled for nine. It is thus most probable his miraculous year was telescoped into the two minutes between his wounds and his death.

#  Part 2, The Secret Miracle : Artifices | Summary

## Summary

On March 19, 1939, in Prague, Czechoslovakia, [Jaromir Hladík](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/character-analysis/#Jaromir_Hlad%C3%ADk) is arrested by the Nazis. Hladík is an ambitious but unproductive writer. He has written but not finished a tragedy _The Enemies_. He is charged with being Jewish, signing a petition against the Nazis, and making a "Judaizing" study of the 16th-century German Christian mystic Jakob Böhme. All the charges are true. The Nazi investigator, Julius Rothe, finds Hladík's name attached to a translation in a publisher's catalogue and is thus convinced the arrested man is important and must therefore be executed. His execution is set for the morning of March 29.

Hladík reacts with "horror." He spends nine nights in jail awaiting his execution. Imagining his execution again and again, he reasons things never turn out the way one imagines, so he hopes imagining his execution might be the same as preventing it. In line with this principle, he spends his days in jail "invent[ing], _so that they might not happen_, the most atrocious particulars." He then imagines he is immortal and invulnerable, so long as the 29th has not yet dawned. He tries to hold onto time, but every night he slips into sleep.

On the 28th he thinks about his tragedy in verse, _The Enemies_, and about his intellectual and literary career. He doesn't think much of his other works, except a philosophical work, _Vindication of Eternity_. The first volume of that work gives the history of the ways other thinkers have envisioned eternity. The second "denies ... that all events in the universe make up a temporal series." Although some arguments claim "a single repetition" is enough to refute time, they are flawed and perplexing.

Hladík thinks _The Enemies_ is his best chance of "redeem[ing] himself from his equivocal and languid past" in which he wrote mediocre works. _The Enemies_ begins with the clock striking seven. A complex plot unfolds, and at a certain point the clock strikes seven again. "The time of day has not advanced," a character in the play notices. The first speaker in the play reappears and repeats the first line.

Hladík still needs to write the next two acts. He addresses God, asking for one more year in which to finish his play. Hladík falls asleep on his "last ... most atrocious night." Although he wants to stay up, sleep sweeps "over him like a dark ocean and drown[s] him." He dreams he is in a library, looking for the one book containing the letter that stands for God. Someone enters carrying an atlas. Hladík looks at a map in it and hears a voice say, "The time for your work has been granted." Hladík wakes up.

He is brought outside to face the firing squad. The soldiers have a casual attitude. It is 8:45, and it seems important to execute Hladík at nine on the dot, so Hladík is forced into an undignified wait. The hour arrives, and the soldiers line up. The sergeant gives the command to fire. Then "the physical universe" stands still. The sergeant's arm remains raised. A puff of smoke remains stationary. The soldiers do not move. A drop of water lies motionless on Hladík's cheek.

Hladík considers various possibilities: perhaps he is mad or dead. After a full day of thinking he realizes his wish has been granted. He is motionless, but he can think. In his mind he finishes writing _The Enemies_, working steadily, adding, refining, and adjusting. He "grows to love the courtyard, the barracks." As Hladík finishes _The Enemies_ time begins again. The drop of water rolls down his cheek and the soldiers' bullets strike him. The narrator adds Hladík "died on March 29, at 9:02 in the morning."

## Analysis

[Jaromir Hladík](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/character-analysis/#Jaromir_Hlad%C3%ADk) seems to be a writer after [Borges](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/author/)'s own heart.

# Part 2, The End : Artifices | Summary

## Summary

In the afternoon Recabarren, a paralyzed shop owner, lies in bed in a room next to his shop. In the shop a guitarist plays the guitar. Recabarren recalls the guitarist's arrival some time before. He engaged in a song contest with another man and lost. Just after the contest Recabarren was adjusting a load on a mule when "his right side had suddenly died and he lost his power of speech." Now Recabarren uses a cowbell to communicate his needs.

The guitarist has continued to hang around the shop since his defeat, playing the guitar but not singing. Recabarren sees a horseman approaching on the plain. The horseman enters the shop and speaks to the guitarist. It is clear they have been waiting for one another since they last met seven years ago. The horseman recalls advice he gave his children at that time: "One man should not shed another man's blood." Then they get down to business, which is about the guitarist's revenge. "Destiny ... has put a knife in my hand," says the horseman, and he makes other veiled threats. As the two leave the shop, the guitarist says, "Perhaps this time it will go as hard on me as the first time."

Outside on the plain the moon is shining. The guitarist reveals the horseman killed his brother seven years before. He asks the horseman "to put all your guts into this" encounter. The narrator reveals the horseman's name: Martín Fierro. (He is the hero of the epic poem _The Gaucho Martín Fierro_, well known in Argentina.)

Fierro and the guitarist fight with knives, and "from his cot Recabarren watch[es] the end." The guitarist loses his footing but rallies and stabs Fierro in the chest. He stabs again, though Recabarren cannot see this blow. Fierro falls and does not get up. The guitarist seems "to watch over his death agony," then wipes his blade on the grass and walks away "without looking back." The narrator says the guitarist has become "the stranger: he had no further mission on earth, but he had killed a man."

## Analysis

In the prologue to Part 2 [Borges](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/author/) says he invented only the character of Recabarren. Not only do the characters of the guitarist and Martín Fierro come from the epic poem _The Return of Martín Fierro_, by José Hernández, the events of the story are also, as Borges says, implicit in the poem. At the end of _The Return of Martín Fierro_, Fierro has a songs-and-riddles duel with a singer. Fierro wins the contest. The singer says he will no longer sing, angrily revealing he is the brother of a man Fierro killed (earlier in the poem). The singer and Fierro are about to fight to the death when onlookers separate them and talk them down. Fierro gives his children, who are present, some fatherly advice and then leaves. His departure is the end of Hernández's poem.

Borges's story is set seven years after the end of _The Return of Martín Fierro_. Many events of the poem's ending are alluded to. The singer/guitarist has engaged in another contest and has once again renounced singing. Fierro refers to seeing his children the last time he and the guitarist met: "I gave them good advice." The guitarist speaks to Fierro with "the sound of hate" in his voice, his hatred clearly stemming from the death of his brother at Fierro's hands. Still it is bold of Borges to say Fierro's death in a duel was "implicit" in the epic poem of his heroism. By having Fierro die, Borges symbolically kills off gaucho literature, the literature of Argentina's cowboys. At the same time he brings gaucho literature new life. At the end of _The Return of Martín Fierro_, Fierro is no longer a lone gaucho on the plain. He is a family man and member of the society he left behind to ride the plain. Thus with "The End" Borges also revives the Fierro myth, returning him to duels with strangers and a harsh, lonely death. Implicitly that same fate now awaits the guitarist. This could mean "The End" is a parable about vengeance. The vengeful act that puts an end to the injustice or punishes the wrong only begins a new round of vengeance. The guitarist's ability to assume the place of the dead Fierro also connects to Borges's theme that "any man is all men." Whether this story is read as a parable about vengeance or as a local variant on Borges's recurrent interest in how any man is all men, the ending connects this story to a number of others in _Ficciones_.

The story offers more than a mere reworking of Hernández's poems. Readers unfamiliar with _The Return of Martín Fierro_ can also be intrigued by "The End." Borges's Recabarren adds an element of doubt to the events. At the beginning the paralyzed Recabarren asks a young boy to tell him who is in the shop. From his vantage point lying in bed Recabarren cannot see inside the shop. And yet the rest of the story—the events in the shop and outside on the plain—is seen mainly through Recabarren's eyes. In several stories in _Ficciones_ illness brings with it strange mental states. [Ireneo Funes](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/character-analysis/#Ireneo_Funes) acquires a prodigious memory. Juan Dahlmann, in "The South," perhaps imagines a duel on the plain after a bout with septicemia. In "The End" Recabarren, too, may be imagining the events

# Part 2, The Sect of the Phoenix : Artifices | Summary

## Summary

A narrator describes conflicting descriptions by commentators on the age and origin of something called "the Sect of the Phoenix." Some trace the origin to the 14th century BCE. Others point out the sect was not called "Phoenix" until some time after the ninth century CE. The narrator adds "the name by which they are known to the outside world is not the same as the one they themselves pronounce."

Another commentator, Miklošić, compares members of the sect to gypsies, also known as Roma-Sinti people. There are both Roma-Sinti people and members of the Sect of the Phoenix in Chile and Hungary, but the two groups "have very little in common." Their professions are different. "The gypsies are of a definite physical type" and they speak or once spoke "a secret language." None of that applies to members of the sect, who blend in with everyone else. "The proof of it is that they have not suffered persecutions." The narrator also disputes comparisons between sect members and Jews. If they sometimes resemble Jews when they are in a Jewish environment, says the narrator, that's only because "they resemble ... all the men in the world. They are everything to all men."

The narrator backtracks a bit on the claim the sect was never persecuted. They have never been persecuted for belonging to the Sect of the Phoenix. But because sect members are in every "human group," they suffered every persecution and took part in every act of revenge.

The narrator lists all the things that do not unite the sect: no common holy book, language, or cultural memory. Although the sect once had a creation myth in common, it has been forgotten. Sect members differ in how they remember one "obscure tradition" from the myth: some think it is a punishment, some a pact, some a privilege. The only commonality now is "the performance of the rite," which the narrator never describes. Members learn the rite from "individuals of the lowest order. A slave, a leper, a beggar plays the role of mystagogue," or someone who initiates another into a mystery cult. The narrator claims the rite is "trivial, momentary, and does not require description" and lists the materials needed: "cork, wax, or gum arabic."

The narrator adds more puzzling information about the rite, also called "the Secret." It "is sacred, but also somewhat ridiculous." It is practiced clandestinely, and no one talks about it. "There are no respectable words to describe it, but it is understood all words refer to it." The narrator quotes Du Cange, a 17th-century French scholar of Latin: "_Orbis terrarum est speculum Ludi_," or "The world is mirror to the game."

Some sect members refuse to practice "the Custom." They are despised for it. Some refuse to practice but "manage to engage in a direct communication with the divinity" and are respected. The narrator has known sect members "on three continents." They find the Secret "paltry, distressing, vulgar." They also cannot believe "their ancestors had lowered themselves to such conduct," and the narrator is surprised "the Secret has not been lost long ago." Despite all the events in the world, "despite wars and exoduses," the Secret remains.

## Analysis

In the prologue to Part 2 [Borges](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/author/) says "The Sect of the Phoenix" hints at "an ordinary fact." Indeed, many interpreters comment "The Sect of the Phoenix" hints at a sexual fact. In an interview Borges said the secret rite was sex: "the act is what [Walt] Whitman says 'the divine husband knows.''' Borges is quoting from the poem "From Pent-Up Aching Rivers" by 19th-century American poet Walt Whitman. In the interview he adds as a child he was shocked to realize his own parents had had sex.

If sex is the story's secret rite, then the story relies on a trick. The "sect" of the title leads a reader to think it is about a small group of individuals, when in fact it is about most of humanity. However, it is difficult to square all the details of the story with this answer. True, "usage does not favor mothers teaching it to their sons." But other hints do not square with Borges's answer: "the necessary materials are cork, wax, or gum arabic."

There is a riddle: "What's green, hangs on a wall, and whistles?" The riddler always has to give the answer, which no one can guess: a herring. When the outraged listener points out a herring isn't green, the riddler answers, "So paint it green." To the objection herrings don't hang on walls, the answer is, "So nail it to the wall." As for the whistling, that was just put in to make it difficult. If readers believe sex is the secret rite, then the situation seems similar for "The Sect of the Phoenix." The story is a riddle with one answer, and things like cork and gum arabic are put in to make it difficult.

But if readers put aside the solution to the riddle, there is still the matter of the story. Regardless of what the rite is, here is a story about the decline and routinization of sacred mysteries. "Once upon a time," the narrator says in storytelling fashion, the sect had a cosmogony—a creation myth, a story about how the world began. Thus it had the secret rite and a sacred interpretation of the world. But the sect did not found a nation in the sign of its sacred truth and did not limit the rite to a particular language or culture. No earthly support exists for the rite—no temple, no institutions, no nation for which to wage holy war. Without these the rite's sacred aspect disappears. People remember only "the obscure tradition of some cosmic punishment." Nothing can be passed on to converts or heirs, except the same rite, divorced from larger meaning.

# Part 2, The South : Artifices | Summary

## Summary

The protagonist, Juan Dahlmann, is the grandson of a German evangelical pastor, Johannes Dahlmann who emigrated to Argentina in 1871. His maternal grandfather, Francisco Flores, died a "romantic" death, "run through with a lance by Indians from Catriel," Argentina. Dahlmann feels a nationalist pride and identifies with his maternal grandfather.

One night as Dahlmann walks up the stairs to read _The Thousand and One Nights_ he hits his head on an open door. He spends several feverish days in bed in a strange mental state. He is acutely aware of things, and time passes with agonizing slowness. He feels he is "in hell."

He is taken to a sanitarium for X-rays. Initially he is happy to be away from his home, the site of his hellish experience, but time in the sanitarium is more agonizing. "He had merely been, up until then, in a suburb of hell." He experiences intense self-loathing, hating "himself in minute detail, he hated his identity, his bodily necessities, his humiliation." A surgeon tells Dahlmann he has septicemia. The diagnosis shocks him. "Physical wretchedness ... had not allowed him time to think of anything so abstract as death."

A few days later Dahlmann is released from the hospital to recover at his ranch in the South. Heading to the train station in a taxi, he feels he is already in the South. On the train Dahlmann tries to read _The Thousand and One Nights_ but finds "the morning itself and the mere fact of being" more interesting than the book. The narrator says Dahlmann "might have" considered "he was traveling into the past and not merely south."

The train conductor tells Dahlmann he will have to get off one stop early and is let off in a desolate spot on the plain. Walking to the nearby town to find transportation to his ranch, he finds the plain beautiful, with its "final splendor" of the evening's fading light. At a general store he arranges for a carriage to the ranch and eats at the store.

The eating area is peopled with "country louts." Squatting on the floor is a silent old man, "dark, dried up, diminutive, and ... outside time, situated in eternity." The "louts" throw spitballs of bread at Dahlmann, who tries to ignore them, turning to read _The Thousand and One Nights_ "as a way of suppressing reality." When Dahlmann can no longer ignore the outrage, he gets up to leave. The owner tries to placate him, saying, "Don't pay any attention to those lads; they're half high."

Dahlmann confronts them, and one of them shouts insults at Dahlmann, then challenges Dahlmann to a knife fight. When the owner points out Dahlmann is unarmed, the old man—"the old ecstatic gaucho"—throws Dahlmann a knife. It seems to be fate: "It was as if the South had resolved that he should accept the duel." Bending to pick up the knife, he realizes picking up the weapon commits him to the fight, and he is going to lose because he is unskilled.

The two men go outside to fight. Dahlmann is "without hope ... [and] also without fear." Dahlmann thinks back to his first horrible night in the hospital. On that night he would have "chosen or dreamt" this death: "in a knife fight, under the open sky, and going forward to the attack."

## Analysis

In the prologue to Part 2, [Borges](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/author/) says "The South" can be "read as a direct narrative of novelistic events, and also in another way." As with "The Secret Miracle" the story raises questions about whether its events are real. It is possible Dahlmann never left the hospital and is only imagining this romantic gaucho-style duel in the South.

Like Borges Dahlmann hits his head and then suffers a serious infection. Borges's bout of septicemia, or blood poisoning, brought him to the brink of death and left him temporarily unable to speak. In several stories collected in _Ficciones_ an illness or injury seems to precede a dreamlike state. But Borges does not romanticize illness. Dahlmann feels he is "in hell," and then the hospital is even worse. In the hospital the ill man has an experience like that of Red Scharlach in "Death and the Compass." While Scharlach lay in bed with fever, he "learned to abominate [his] body," particularly hating its symmetry. While Dahlmann is ill he "hate[s] himself in minute detail ... his identity, his bodily necessities, his humiliation." So Dahlmann has a strong motive to escape from reality.

There are hints the experience may be a kind of fantasy or dream. On the way to his house in the South Dahlmann stops at a café and strokes a cat, but he has the sense "this contact was an illusion." On the train, accompanied by his copy of _The Thousand and One Nights_, Dahlmann feels he is "two men at a time." One man "travel[s] through the autumn day" to the South, and the other is "locked up in a sanitarium and subject to methodical servitude." When Dahlmann faces down "the tough," he suddenly recalls the sanitarium: "_They would not have allowed such things to happen to me in the sanitarium_." Finally as he heads out to the plain, he feels "if he had been able to choose, then, or to dream his death," it would have been this one.

> Now, in all memories, a fictitious past occupies the place of any other. 

Narrator, [Part 1, Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/part-1-tl%C3%B6n-uqbar-orbis-tertius-summary/)

A secret society has invented a planet named Tlön and has quietly spread the news of its existence. The fictional world gradually supplants the real one. Thus in a Borgesian twist, the imitation world is superior to the real one. The narrator's remark points to a late stage in that development. The fictitious planet Tlön has supplanted the real world not only in the present but even in memories of the past.

 > The text of Cervantes' [and Menard's books] are verbally identical, but the second is almost infinitely richer. 

Narrator, [Part 1, Pierre Menard, Author of Don Quixote](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/part-1-pierre-menard-author-of-don-quixote-summary/)

The two texts being compared are identical, word for word. But Menard, a 20th-century Frenchman, has written part of a novel in 17th-century Spanish. The narrator finds Menard's accomplishment that much more remarkable than Cervantes's writing in his own idiom, 17th-century Spanish. The ideas referred to in each text seem more surprising coming from the 20th-century Menard. Although there is no verbal basis for comparison, because they are the same, the two texts can be read differently. This concept underscores the author's importance in the interpretation of a book. The paradox is Menard's two disconnected chapters are superior to Cervantes's entire novel. Likewise it is paradoxical for Menard's copy to be "almost infinitely richer" than the original work.

> He understood that he also was an illusion, that someone was dreaming him. 

Narrator, [Part 1, The Circular Ruins](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/part-1-the-circular-ruins-summary/)

The main character of "The Circular Ruins" finally has created a man by dreaming him. The dreamed-of man knows nothing of his origins nor his invulnerability to fire. But everything that seemed to mark the "son" as different from his creator turns out to be true of the "father" as well. Readers know nothing of the wizard's life before his arrival in the jungle. And he too is unaware, until the end, he is someone's dream.

4.

> The consequences, sometimes, are terrifying. 

Narrator, [Part 1, The Babylon Lottery](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/part-1-the-babylon-lottery-summary/)

The lottery begins as a simple drawing for cash prizes. As it evolves into something more complex, penalties are added—lottery results, such as fines, jail terms, and death, that can have devastating consequences for the "winner." Then in a late stage of the lottery's evolution, there are "impersonal drawings" that sometimes have "terrifying" consequences. These likely are worse than the personal consequences already in effect, but examples are never provided.

5.

> I _do_ know that his books are over-anxious to astonish. 

Narrator, [Part 1, An Examination of the Work of Herbert Quain](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/part-1-an-examination-of-the-work-of-herbert-quain-summary/)

The narrator has been explaining the complicated opinions of the writer Herbert Quain. Quain does not share the opinions of noted writers Gustave Flaubert and Henry James, who thought "works of art are infrequently and laboriously composed." Quain thinks "good literature [is] common enough." But then Quain seems to swing back to the Flaubert/James position because he thinks books should "astonish," and "to be astonished by rote [habitually] is difficult." The weakness of Quain's work, it seems, is its anxious need to astonish.

> The universe (which others call the Library) is composed of ... an infinite number of hexagonal galleries. 

Narrator, [Part 1, The Library of Babel](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/part-1-the-library-of-babel-summary/)

This opening sentence of "The Library of Babel" functions as a metaphysical proposition: the universe is an infinite Library. The rest of the story works out the consequences of an infinite (or almost infinite) Library housing books that are nothing but combinations of the 25 "orthographic symbols." The story does not have characters other than a lugubrious narrator-librarian. Nothing much happens in the story, though drastic and distant events are relayed, such as the destruction of books or the suicides of librarians. But Borges manages to create a taut story of existential doubt, seemingly with nothing more than this one proposition.

Albert is speaking to Dr. Yu Tsun, great-grandson of Ts'ui Pên, author of _The Garden of Forking Paths_. He is speaking of the theory of possible worlds but in a way in which all possible worlds are actual. There is dramatic irony in Albert's words. He believes he is in a world in which he is Yu Tsun's gracious host, not his enemy. But readers soon learn Yu Tsun has come to Albert's house to kill him.

> The two projects ... are lacking in sense, but they reveal a certain stammering greatness. 

Narrator, [Part 2, Funes, the Memorious](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/part-2-funes-the-memorious-summary/)

The two projects are Funes's. He conceives of a numbering "system" in which every number would have a completely unsystematic proper name. His other project is a catalogue of his 70,000 most essential memories. He discards this project as "interminable" and "useless."

Like the old-fashioned term _idiot savant_, the narrator's phrase "stammering greatness" uses the metaphor of pathology to suggest a combination of deficit and talent. For all of Funes's prodigious mental abilities, he is unable to think in a way that lets him live in the world.

> He was the solitary and lucid spectator of a multiform world which was ... intolerably exact. 

Narrator, [Part 2, Funes, the Memorious](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/part-2-funes-the-memorious-summary/)

After being thrown from a horse, Funes develops a remarkable memory and a remarkable way of perceiving the world. He notices every detail, right down to the rapidly shifting shape of a horse's mane in the wind. He lives in an exhausting welter of tiny details. No one else apprehends the world in such detail, leaving Funes very much alone. He is reduced to being a "spectator of a ... world" rather than an actor in it because he cannot think in general enough concepts to accomplish anything. The example of Funes shows forgetting and inexactitude are necessary for thought.

> I am Vincent Moon. Despise me. 

[John Vincent Moon](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/characters/#John_Vincent_Moon), [Part 2, The Form of the Sword](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/part-2-the-form-of-the-sword-summary/)

Moon says these words at the end of the story he has been telling to a man who turns out to be named Borges. Until this moment Borges thinks Moon is "the Englishman of La Colorada" (who soon introduced himself as an Irishman).

Moon has been describing his own traitorous cowardice. It is a surprise his loathing for Moon's treachery turns out to be self-loathing, but self-deprecation does not lessen Moon's self-involvement. The ending is a surprise, but that is the story's weakness. Even Borges later dismissed it as a "trick story."

> And supposing the story of this night were a sham? 

[Commissioner Treviranus](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/characters/#Commissioner_Treviranus), [Part 2, Death and the Compass](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/part-2-death-and-the-compass-summary/)

"Death and the Compass" is a detective story in the tradition of Edgar Allan Poe's August Dupin or Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories. Treviranus is the plodding, unimaginative police official whose analysis of the crime should pale in comparison to the insights of master sleuth Erik Lönnrot. But on "this night" as on the first night of this series of crimes, Treviranus is right, and Lönnrot is wrong.

12.

> He renounced honor, good, peace, the Kingdom of Heaven, as others, less heroically, renounced pleasure. 

Narrator, [Part 2, Three Versions of Judas](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/part-2-three-versions-of-judas-summary/)

The narrator is speaking of Nils Runeberg's second version of Judas, in his revised book _Kristus och Judas_ (_Christ or Judas_). In the first version Judas was a reflection of Jesus, playing his predestined part in the Resurrection. In this second Judas acts more freely, willingly becoming an ascetic. But Runeberg's twist is to suppose Judas also renounces spiritual progress. He renounces all spiritual reward on Earth and in Heaven. In doing this he becomes a better ascetic than Jesus, who has committed no sins on Earth and has Heaven waiting for him. Thus Jesus is "less heroic."

13.

> He added to the concept of the Son, which seemed exhausted, the complexities of calamity and evil. 

Narrator, [Part 2, Three Versions of Judas](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/part-2-three-versions-of-judas-summary/)

The narrator is summarizing Nils Runeberg's work as a theologian, particularly his final version of Judas. Most people would think of "calamity and evil" as subtractions from the concept of the son of God, but for the narrator they are enriching additions.

14.

> From his cot, Recabarren saw the end. 

Narrator, [Part 2, The End](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/part-2-the-end-summary/)

Recabarren lies on his cot, paralyzed from an apparent stroke. The "end" he sees is Martín Fierro's death.

The attention to Recabarren's situation is significant. At the beginning of the story Recabarren has to ask a boy to tell him who is in the store because he cannot see from his cot. Therefore, he is unlikely to have seen Fierro enter the store and unlikely to have witnessed the fight. Recabarren may be imagining these events.

15.

> Dahlmann closed his book and allowed himself to live. 

Narrator, [Part 2, The South](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/part-2-the-south-summary/)

Juan Dahlmann has been ill and confined to a sanitarium. Traveling by train to the South, where he will recover at his country estate, he has brought with him _The Thousand and One Nights_. But on the train he is distracted from reading by "the morning itself and the mere fact of being." In closing the book he turns away from fantasy and toward real life, grateful to be alive. But readers may be aware he is not engaged in real life. It is possible Dahlmann is dreaming and is actually still in the sanitarium.

# Symbols

## Mirrors

In _Ficciones_ mirrors symbolize duplication. In "Death and the Compass" Lönnrot arrives at the villain's lair and finds himself "infinitely reflected in opposing mirrors." These reflections are fitting because Scharlach is a reflection of Lönnrot. Like Lönnrot he reads Hebraic books and interprets crimes on that basis. In the story "The Approach to Al-Mu'tasim" the illustrated book _The Approach to Al-Mu'tasim_ is subtitled "A Game with Shifting Mirrors." In that story the law student meets a succession of men, each of them a "mirror" of Al-Mu'tasim. But the mirror shifts because in the end there is the suggestion the law student himself is Al-Mu'tasim.

The mirrors stand for the way art and thought create duplicate worlds or duplicate selves. Thus in the entranceway to the Library in Babel, there "hangs a mirror, which faithfully duplicates appearances." The mirror's duplication may be "illusory," as the narrator of "The Library of Babel" says. However, the mirror's duplication reveals both worlds, the real one and its reflection, are _nothing but_ appearances. Thus the mirror removes some reality from the so-called real world. This is one way in which "mirrors have something grotesque about them," as the narrator states in "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius." In that story the narrator and his friend Bioy discover "from the far end of the corridor, the mirror was watching us." The world in the mirror, or the mirror itself, can acquire a grotesque autonomy in _Ficciones_.

## Labyrinths

Labyrinths in _Ficciones_ represent the wanderer's perplexity and the maze-maker's attempt to construct something infinite. They also represent the tangled paths of thought and interpretation. Although labyrinths are an important symbol in _Ficciones_, they are mentioned rather than depicted. Labyrinths turn up in book titles: _A General History of Labyrinths_ (in "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius") and _The God of the Labyrinth_ (again in "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius" and also in "An Examination of the Works of Herbert Quain"). This difference between a physical and a written labyrinth is the central focus of "The Garden of Forking Paths." Yu Tsun's grandfather, Ts'ui Pên, retires to write a novel and create a labyrinth. At his death he bequeaths to his heirs the novel _The Garden of Forking Paths_, but no one can find his labyrinth. Like all the labyrinths in _Ficciones_ Ts'ui Pên's is "a symbolic labyrinth," as Stephen Albert points out. Its mazelike forking paths represent the multiplicity of possible interpretations.

# Themes

## Copies

_Ficciones_ contains any number of doubles and reflections, imitation worlds, and imitated books. Often these copies have a complicated and troubling relationship to the originals. The copy sometimes overwhelms, undermines, or infiltrates the original. In "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius," a secret society of philosophers invents a planet, Tlön, disseminating information about it through a plagiarized encyclopedia. The invented planet infiltrates the real one, and one day, as the narrator predicts, the invented planet will overtake the original: "The world will be Tlön." In "[Pierre Menard](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/character-analysis/#Pierre_Menard), Author of Don Quixote," a 20th-century French writer sets out to write _Don Quixote_. His aim is not to copy Cervantes's 16th-century Spanish novel but to produce it anew, word for word, to become the author who could—and did—write _Don Quixote_, but at the present time. Thus his task is more difficult, for he must learn 16th-century Spanish and absorb a different culture that no longer exists. He succeeds in writing two disconnected chapters. Strangely, the narrator finds Menard's _Don Quixote_ "almost infinitely richer" than the original, as he considers the difficulty of the task. Both the planet Tlön and Menard's _Don Quixote_ raise questions about the value of a created work. With sly humor [Jorge Luis Borges](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/author/) proposes an image of the world superior to the actual world.

In "Three Versions of Judas" the Swedish theologian, Runeberg, proposes Judas as a kind of reflection of Jesus. Judas, too, had a God-destined task. Runeberg then refines his ideas about Judas, finally deciding Judas is the true incarnation of God. Again the copy or double is superior to the original. Judas is Jesus with the addition of infamy and sin. In Borges's eyes these additions do not detract from Judas's divinity. On the contrary Runeberg's Judas has "added to the concept of the Son ... the complexities of calamity and evil."

## Interpretation

In _Ficciones_ detectives, spies, and scholars examine texts for multiple meanings. Many are tongue-in-cheek, poking fun at critics and scholars. "The Approach to Al-Mu'tasim" can be read as a series of adventures that begins in a riot. It can also be read as a story about a search for the divine. The story is not told directly but is instead recounted by a commentator who has read a translation of the book _The Approach to Al-Mu'tasim_. Several other stories in _Ficciones_ are also commentaries on imaginary works: "An Examination of the Work of Herbert Quain," "[Pierre Menard](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/character-analysis/#Pierre_Menard), Author of Don Quixote," and "Three Versions of Judas." Indeed, the latter story is about interpretation not only of fictitious texts but of Christian theology in the three ways the story's scholar presents his unorthodox views of the man known as Jesus's betrayer.

Interpretations take on added significance and are the underlying theme of "Death and the Compass." The cerebral detective Lönnrot is convinced the motive for the murders lies in the scholarly texts in the first murdered man's hotel room. Dismissing the straightforward interpretation—robbery and mistaken identity—Lönnrot claims, "I would prefer a purely rabbinical explanation, not the imaginary mischances of an imaginary robber." His powers of interpretation are equaled by the villain's, who ultimately "out-interprets" the detective.

In "Pierre Menard, Author of Don Quixote," critical interpretation comes into play as well in its absurdity. The narrator reads Cervantes's original "as if Menard had conceived it," recognizing Menard's style in the text. The narrator actually finds "the fragmentary _Don Quixote_ of Menard is more subtle than" Cervantes's.

In the matter of interpretations it is hard to imagine [Borges](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/author/) siding with the common-sensical interpretation. Sometimes he seems like his double Herbert Quain, whose books try hard to astonish readers. Thus the inventiveness of "The Library of Babel," which takes "sortition" to a logical extreme. (Sortition is ruling by lottery, in which rules are chosen by chance rather inheriting office or being elected to it.) Likewise the description of Quain's works is inventive—Quain writes complicated experimental works, and the narrator prefers the more complicated interoperations of Quain's works. (Thus the popular audience interprets Quain according to the fashion of the day, as Freudian. But the narrator interprets Quain in light of the British idealist philosopher F.H. Bradley.) However, Borges's stories also show the darker side of preferring complicated interpretations. In "Death and the Compass" Lönnrot's preference for "interesting" and "rabbinical" interpretations leads him to his death. His unhappy ending is perhaps a warning about going too far in interpretation.

## Infinity

Many of the stories in _Ficciones_ concern infinite artworks or infinite systems, meaning they have no limits or boundaries and thus are endless. "The Babylon Lottery" evolves from a simple cash prize to a system in which "the number of [lottery] drawings is infinite." Herbert Quain, commenting on his novel with multiple paths, thinks "demiurges and gods would choose an infinite scheme: infinite stories, infinitely subdivided." In "The Garden of Forking Paths," Stephen Albert refers to the moment at which _The Thousand and One Nights_ becomes metafictional. Scheherazade starts to tell the story of herself telling _The Thousand and One Nights_. And within that telling she risks "again arriving at the night upon which she will relate it, and on to infinity."

Infinity is a concept in both mathematics and metaphysics, the branch of philosophy concerned with the nature of things. [Borges](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ficciones/author/) has his own, slightly quixotic, concept of metaphysical infinity. In his essay "Avatars of the Tortoise," published in _Labyrinths_, Borges writes, "There is a concept which corrupts and upsets all others ... I refer to the infinite." For Borges infinity is a puzzling paradox, after which nothing can be the same. Infinity is like his fictional planet Tlön: knowledge of it creeps into everything.

In _Ficciones_ Borges often presents infinity alongside an idea of circularity. At the end of "Death and the Compass" Lönnrot expresses the belief he and Red Scharlach will confront one another infinitely many times, and each time Scharlach will kill him. The Library in "The Library of Babel" is "limitless and periodic." For the narrator this means the infinite volumes of the Library will all be repeated at some point, giving the immense disorder a kind of order. In _Ficciones_ infinity is contrasted with a restraining or structuring principle of repetition. The stories show an irresolvable tension between these two.

# Biography

### Early Life and Beginning Career

Jorge Luis Borges was born on August 24, 1899, in Buenos Aires, Argentina. His prominent Argentine family included some English ancestors, and Borges actually learned English before Spanish. As a child he read avidly in his father's extensive English library, his favorites including American humorist Mark Twain's _The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn_ (1884), the novels of English writer H.G. Wells, Spanish writer Miguel de Cervantes's _Don Quixote_ (1615), and _The Thousand and One Nights_ (1704)_._ Later in his life Borges wrote of his father's library: "In fact, I sometimes think I have never strayed outside that library."

In 1914 Borges's father took the family to live in Geneva, Switzerland, for several years. There Borges learned German and French and graduated from the Collège de Genève. Borges moved with his family to the Spanish island of Majorca in 1919 and then spent a year in mainland Spain where he became part of the avant-garde Ultraist literary movement, which emphasized poetry with complicated metrical patterns, free verse, and bold imagery.

### Early Publications

Borges returned to Buenos Aires in 1921, and two years later his first book, the collection of poems _Fervor of Buenos Aires_, was published. Active in the literary world, he founded literary journals, published essays and more poems, and established an Argentine branch of the Ultraist movement, from which he later distanced himself.

Borges's first collection of stories, _A Universal History of Infamy_ published in 1935, straddles a line between fiction and biography. The stories recount the lives of roguish or outrageous historical figures, such as an impostor masquerading as an heir ("The Implausible Imposter, Tom Castro") or the Spanish missionary Bartolomé de las Casas, who almost single-handedly began the transatlantic slave trade in the Americas ("The Dread Redeemer Lazarus Morell").

Borges took a high-ranking job as a librarian in Buenos Aires and then suffered two crushing blows in 1938: his father died, and Borges accidentally struck his head on a casement window and sustained a severe injury. The wound led to septicemia, or blood poisoning, leaving him delirious and unable to speak. But when Borges recovered, he experienced a surge of creativity and in the following years published some of his best stories. These appear in _Ficciones_ (1944) and _The Aleph and Other Stories, 1933–1969_ (1970).

### International Acclaim and Later Years

In 1946 Juan Perón was elected president of Argentina. Perón was staunchly anti–United States and anti-Britain. Because Borges had expressed support for the Allies in World War II (1939–45), the Perón government transferred Borges to a degrading job as the public market inspector of poultry and rabbits, a job from which Borges resigned. Without his job Borges got by on lecturing, editing, and writing. In 1952 he published a collection of his essays, _Other Inquisitions, 1937–1952_. When Perón was ousted in 1955 Borges took an honorary post at the National Library of Argentina and became a professor of English and American literature at the University of Buenos Aires.

Beginning in the 1920s Borges suffered progressively worsening eyesight, the result of a hereditary condition. By the late 1950s he was completely blind. He continued to write, however, dictating short works. He published two books that blurred the distinction between prose and poetry: _Dreamtigers_ (1960) and _The Book of Imaginary Beings_ (1967). He also published the story collections _Doctor Brodie's Report_ (1970) and _The Book of Sand_ (1975).

Borges began to receive international attention during the 1960s, particularly in the United States and Europe. In 1961 he shared the international literary Formentor Prize with the better-known Irish writer Samuel Beckett, the reflected glory bringing Borges's work to greater notice. He died on June 14, 1986, in Geneva.

### Borges's Legacy and Influence

The 1960s saw publication of several essays praising Borges and attempting to bring his work to a wider readership. Writing in _The New York Review of Books_ in 1964, American critic Paul de Man called "[Borges's] neglect somewhat unfair," though after such faint praise he went on to clarify that "Borges is a complex writer, particularly difficult to place." In 1967 American poet John Ashbery wrote in _The New York Times Book Review_ Borges was "the greatest living Spanish-language writer." In Latin America Borges's fantastical stories paved the way for the novels of the Latin American boom, a group including Mexican Carlos Fuentes's _The Death of Artemio Cruz_ (1962), Argentinean Julio Cortázar's _Hopscotch_ (1963); and Colombian Gabriel García Márquez's _One Hundred Years of Solitude_ (1967). Borges's emphasis on dreams, fantastic occurrences, and complex narrative structures greatly influenced the Magic Realism movement. Magic realism is a type of literature that includes fantastical or magical elements in otherwise realistic settings. It flourished particularly in Latin America in the late 20th century and includes the novelists Colombian Gabriel García Márquez, Brazilian Jorge Amado, and Chilean Isabel Allende. Some critics even count Borges among the magical realists. In any case his stories show the contrast between realistic or conventional story settings and fantastical elements. In the United States Borges's use of parody and detective fiction influenced such postmodern novelists as Robert Coover, Thomas Pynchon, and E.L. Doctorow. Borges continues to be read and admired the world over for his lucid prose and dazzling narrative structures.
