## Challenges of Domesticating Bears

Bear domestication is a difficult task since there are many obstacles along the way. Here are four main challenges.

### Natural Instincts

Bears are naturally wild animals, and they belong to the wilderness. 

In captive conditions, their hunting instincts, sense of territoriality, and tendency to roam vast territories are limited. 

These behaviors are hardwired into their DNA and cannot be modified in course of one generation. 

That being said, these traits make bears challenging to control in captivity, and even trained bears may revert to their natural instincts, putting their caretakers at a risk.

### Genetics Barriers

Another challenge in domesticating bears lies in genetics. Unlike domesticated animals such as dogs or cats, bears are not genetically predisposed to living with humans. 

When we say domesticated animal, we think of an animal whose behavior is fully under the control of its owner. 

It also means that the animal has traits like docility, socialization, and obedience. And most crucially, it means that the coexistence will not put the caretaker in danger, which is impossible with wild bears.

The [process of domestication](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/domesticated-animals) may take many generations before any significant progress is made.

### Solitary Nature

Bears are solitary animals, and they usually prefer to live alone, except for mothers and cubs during the breeding season. In actuality, bears are the least social animals among the Carnivora. ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear))

You might wonder why a solitary lifestyle affects domestication. The reason is that animals that are more unsocial are harder to tame since they do not recognize the hierarchy.

Wolves, on the other hand, have been successfully tamed to some extent because they understand the social hierarchy and pack life.

In the wild, bears often kill each other, even their own cubs. So, it’s unlikely that a “tamed” bear will connect with humans when they don’t even form attachments to their own kind.

While a domesticated bear may develop a certain level of bonding with humans, it will never see humans as part of its “clan” or consider them as its leader.

### Safety Concerns

I don’t need to tell you that [bears are not friendly](https://wildexplained.com/are-bears-friendly/) as they may seem in some viral social media videos. In fact, they are one of the largest and most powerful land mammals on our planet.

And while it’s true that most bear species are not typically aggressive toward humans, they are capable of killing any person in a flash.

Unfortunately, driven by their hunting instincts, these reactions may happen in various situations. Bears can suddenly change their behavior in a matter of seconds, making them highly unpredictable, which is a major obstacle on the road to domestication.

So, despite many bears being trained to be around people and having years of experience with humans without any significant incidents, predicting a bear’s behavior remains impossible.
