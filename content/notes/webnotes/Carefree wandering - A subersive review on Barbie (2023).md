_____
**Barbie** has a 90 score among critics and an 86 audience the mainstream reviews which actually often read as I've written by chat GPT use one characterization over and over again subversive according to Rotten Tomatoes that's the critics consensus
that begs the question : 

> how does today's culture industry manage to produce a Blockbuster movie that is consensually acclaimed as subversive while at the same time making sure it's as mainstream as possible?

the answer is of course **because in times of woke the appearance of subversion or better the simulation of subversion is key to success especially in the media and in market**

## The four levels of subversion (in barbie)

### humor

 the jokes are standard and mildly entertaining , for example the exaggerated gender stereotypes. The main type of humor is the countless references other popular movies and saterial takes on music videos and commercials. this is a type of [[Postmodernist Mass Humor]], which relies on self-referential jokes, they insult and criticise themselves before people do, making it appear more self critical and less offensive. *postmodernist humor is not subversive, it's industrial*

### ideology

 *the theme of feminism portraited is over simplistic and is no more subversive neoliberal ideology today* that woman need to be empowered to make careers and earn money, and then it's okay for them to have fun by unironically dressing in pink and watching movies, which is fine, but not subversive   

### capitalism 

the movie satirically exposes the patriarchal and profiteering evils of [Mattel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattel) the corporation that marketed Barbie but the movie is produced by Matte. and this is very openly acknowledged, it's a kind of self-ironic self-criticism of capitalism, a kind of postmodernist counterpart to the punitive self-criticisms under Communist Regime. it's a shrewd public exercise size in political Rehabilitation. the obvious purpose of this self-criticism is to update the Barbie brand once more and to realign it with current political and cultural Trends. this it employs so obvious that even most of the reviewers pick up on it . the typical reaction of reviewers goes like this one from the guardian
> Guric the director is having a laugh at their own expense conceding that all her subversions will be happily permitted so long as they agree with the profit margins 

but if all the movies subversions of capitalism are happily permitted by capitalism and they're also not subversions at the same time or rather they are simulated subversions by the culture industry **by the way the guardian is a prime example for tedious reviews in today's media** with one great exception the breakfast reviews by the food critic [Robin price](https://robinprice.net/)

### Identity 

anyways this inevitably brings me to the topic of profilicity. the movie's main commercial purpose is profilicity the reshaping of the Mattel and the Barbie brand. but given the profile symbiosis between the movie its makers and its viewers and reviewers, it's not just about reshaping the profile of a commercial brand, it's also about the promotion of profilicity as a personal identity technology, and this is most clearly evidenced in the phenomenon of many people coming to watch it dressed in pink.

philosophically speaking the main theme of the film is the subversion of inauthenticity. Barbie lives in a fake imagine fantasy led her purpose in the film is the transition to reality, not an ideal reality but a real reality 
this is symbolized at the end of the movie with her visit to a gynecologist. at one point rather early in the movie she had affirmed her dullness pointing out that she has no genitalia. that at the end she has a vagina proves her 
transition to feminine authenticity, a triumph over her previous fakeness. before Barbie's own ultimate transition to authenticity she had already liberated Ken Cantu had only existed in the hyper-gendered world of barbieland as a toy male his whole existence was a never-ending mildly funny display of gender stereotypes and he had been continuously obsessed with impressing Barbie to become a partner and to sleep with her toward the end of the movie. however Barbie tells Ken that he has to find out who he is without her. maybe all the things that you thought made you aren't really you she tells him this brings Ken to the authentic Epiphany Ken is me not just the one Ken played by Ryan Gosling but all the other minor Kens in the movie now realize that Ken is me. this is the moment of their authentic Awakening the birth of their individuality and originality. the main philosophical theme of the movie is precisely this the transition from what I call sincerity to authenticity from role based in this case gender role-based identity a stereotypical male or stereotypical female Ken or Barbie too authentic or individual identity as the unique human being canobarbee 

*most Hollywood movies even comedies have cheesy endings and Barbie is no exception*

my colleague Dimitra Amarante do summed up the movie as *cringy authenticity*. that's spot-on.

the main motive of Barbie especially at the end is a Cheesy and unfunny celebration of the standard Master 
Narrative of the western individual the struggle of becoming mature and authenti.c and the movie suggests even our American corporations like Mattel dedicate themselves to this struggle. *neoliberal life and culture is about subverting inauthenticity, in fact of course Barbie does not subvert in authenticity, she only simulates the subversion of inauthenticity. after all Barbie the movie is not exactly a manifestation of the authentic world while the movie's plot is about the transition from inauthenticity to authenticity, from an imagined to real world. the movie itself is of course not authentic, it's a meticulously staged product of the culture industry.* instead of being actually subversive Barbie is a great [[Media theory -  profilicity|profilicity]] Fest where everyone can participate in the great simulation of subversion by watching it in pink or by commenting on it in the media
