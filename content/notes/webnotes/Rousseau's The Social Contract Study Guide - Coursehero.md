### At a Glance

Jean-Jacques Rousseau's political thought was influenced by events of the day, contemporaries such as French lawyer Montesquieu, fellow 18th-century Enlightenment era thinkers (such as English philosopher John Locke), and Greek philosophers Aristotle and Plato. In _The Social Contract_ Rousseau attempts to work through and synthesize features of diverse political theories. At its core is the dedication to valuing human freedom and equality, and promoting the collective goodwill.

### About the Title

_The Social Contract_, or _Principles of Political Rights_, is Jean-Jacques Rousseau's analysis of a legitimate state. That legitimacy derives from the idea of a contract or association entered into by free and equal people—hence the contract's "social" nature. People enter into an agreement in a civil society in order to preserve and protect themselves and their freedoms. The constitution and laws that govern public life articulate this contract; they declare the general will of the citizenry—the collective body Rousseau calls the "Sovereign."

# Main Ideas

## The State of Nature, Equality, and Liberty

Jean-Jacques Rousseau believes certain concepts and activities taken for granted in modern life are not natural to human beings. These include property, inequality, and law. In the state of nature, human beings are free and equal. They are free in that they can do what they want, and they are moral equals in that no one person's liberty is superior to another's. This freedom is essentially freedom from the coercive effects of a civil society governed by one or more people who do not have their subjects' best interests in mind. Moreover, people are free from the arbitrary requirements of society. Expectations to conform to societal norms and contrived needs create psychological dependency and make people vulnerable to domination. That dependency is not limited to the weak and poor, it is also created by luxury and wealth.

Freedom in the state of nature is not, however, absolute. It is restricted by the imperative of self-preservation and, more generally, instinct and desires. These desires or passions generate real and perceived needs. Real needs are those that ensure survival, such as food and reproduction. Perceived needs are generated in a society. These will include things such as friendship and property.

A legitimate civil society will preserve at least an approximation of natural freedom, which is largely concentrated in the general will. By focusing on the good of the whole, the artificial needs that create dependence and inequality will not arise.

Rousseau still has to reconcile what appears to be a potential conflict between the individual will and the general will. His accounts of the general will and sovereignty offer a synthesis. Although sovereignty can override the individual will, there is no inconsistency, to the extent that this will is also a part of the general will and the general will is formalized in the Sovereign.

Rousseau is also criticized for apparently maintaining inconsistent positions on the nature of society. At times he seems to favor communitarianism, and at other times, liberalism. Both are arguably reconciled by the source of the general will that aims at the common good. To the extent that an individual's will does not interfere with the common good, there is no impediment to individual liberty. Moreover, what makes the general will possible is the assumption that what is common to each individual is the desire for liberty, self-preservation, and security—all of which the Sovereign is meant to articulate in law.

## Civil Society, Government, Law, and the Common Good

Civil society is the opposite of the state of nature. The formation of civil society, Rousseau contends, has its origins in the family. Led by the father, whose love for his children inspires his desire for their best interests, children eventually gain their independence. Mapped onto a civil society, the common good becomes the aim of the general will, and the general will preserves civil freedom through enacting law. Law, in turn, is applicable to the populace, not individual citizens as such.

It is the government's role to implement laws. Rousseau does not specify which type of government a civil society should adopt, though he has a preference for aristocracy. His neutrality on this issue is based on his view that there are myriad variables that make one form of government preferable to another. The most common forms, however, are monarchy (single rule), aristocracy (small group rule), and democracy (large group/societal rule).

It is worth reiterating a distinction Rousseau makes between the Sovereign and the government. The Sovereign is the body politic, the collective legislating voice of the citizenry. The government is not the Sovereign. It does not represent the people but instead ensures that their voice is heard by enforcing law.

## Sovereignty, the General Will, and the Will of All

Sovereignty is the general will. The general will is the voice of the citizens. In their hands, all social power is vested. The purpose of the Sovereign is to secure freedom and equality for all. Fulfilling this role is what gives the Sovereign moral legitimacy. According to Rousseau, the general will is an infallible voice of the public good, and it is the Sovereign's obligation to protect it. While the general will organizes the form of government and creates laws, for example, it is neutral with respect to the particularities; its sole aim is the public good. The general will is, effectively, an idea. It is formalized and embodied by sovereignty and the political body that assembles to debate and legislate.

Rousseau distinguishes the general from the collective will, which facilitates understanding the former. The collective will is simply the sum of individual wills, in all their particularities and differences. There is no unifying of such disparate wills, even if they are collected in factions. Hence, the general will, which has one aim on which all can agree, serves, essentially, as a single will.

## Individual Freedom

According to Rousseau, individual freedom is one's natural state. This freedom is preserved and protected by the social contract. It is also balanced against an orderly society in which the good of all is protected. So, from the standpoint of the Sovereign, the imperative is that the individual will be one and the same as the general will—or at the very least, the individual will cannot usurp the general will. One's private interests cannot be taken to be the interests of everyone else. The power of the Sovereign guarantees a domain of freedom—indeed, equal freedom for all—under law. Apart from participation in sovereign affairs, individual freedom is not brooked by political authority.

## Parliamentary Assembly

Rousseau distinguishes between the Sovereign and the government. Government is separate from the people, because it must maintain both its impartiality and legitimacy. The Sovereign, as a body, is the collective of all citizens. The government is the administrative arm of the state. As the executive branch, it executes and administers the laws generated by the Sovereign.

When the citizens come together in the "People's Assembly," laws are proposed and voted on. Their task is to determine "whether it does or does not conform to the general will, which is theirs." By casting ballots, each expresses their opinion. The "tally of the votes yields the declaration of the general will." Rousseau is adamant that there be a physical assembly; that is, that citizens appear to propose and vote on law. Moreover, these assemblies must be regular.

# Context

## The Enlightenment

[Jean-Jacques Rousseau](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/author/) lived and worked during the period known as the Enlightenment, which is embodied in his work in the ways in which he challenges preconceived notions of religion while continuing to advocate for religious belief outside the dogmatic and authoritarian systems in which it was embodied. Some aspects of his work also identify him as a precursor to the Romantic era, in which intense feeling is privileged over rationality.

The Enlightenment period lasted for most of the 18th century. It was characterized by enthusiastic confidence in the power of human reason to seek and find answers to the most important questions about knowledge, nature, politics, art, and ethics. Religious authority and dogma were thrown over in favor of a burgeoning scientific method and faith in rationality.

Some features of Rousseau's religious views fit well in the Enlightenment context. Rousseau argued in _Émile_ for the view that all religions are of equal value, insofar as they lead believers to a virtuous life. This conclusion reflects the Enlightenment preference of religious belief over submission to an authoritarian church. Meanwhile, Rousseau's passion for nature, from which his veneration of feeling is likely derived, along with his erratic and passionate friendships and romances, anticipates and gives voice to Romanticism. Still, Rousseau's lifelong appreciation of nature was combined with an appropriately Enlightenment-era intellectual interest in understanding it.

Rousseau's thesis, first articulated in his 1750 essay _The Discourse on the Arts and Sciences_, continues throughout his work. This thesis states there is a direct relationship between intellectual conformity and moral degeneration. In other words, the cultivation of rational faculties within a system laden with pretext and decoration dulls the natural goodness associated with freedom. According to Rousseau, human beings are naturally independent and self-sufficient. Society weakens humans by increasing dependence.

## Divine Monarchs and Revolution

Enlightenment thinkers questioned not only the authority of the church, but also the right of divine rule. Not only was reliance on one's own reason over external authority permeating scientific reasoning, but the related concept of autonomy was also taking center stage in moral and political thought. Autonomy is freedom from external control; rational autonomy in political and moral thought emphasizes self-governance, or the independence of the individual to make correct use of one's own reason. While thinkers such as Hobbes believed in the divine right of kings, others, such as Locke, Voltaire, Montesquieu, and Rousseau, proposed forms of limited government.

Monarchs, or kings, often viewed their rule as absolute—justified by divine right. The divine right of kings became a political doctrine that declared a monarch's authority to be derived from God, who was said to have put them on Earth to rule. As such, the monarch claimed to be above human law and its institutions. The scope of this doctrine grew in the 16th and 17th centuries to include not just authority in the political arena but also in religious matters. In France, Louis XIV was an example of the sort of conduct that fomented revolution (his outlandish spending at the expense of his subjects' well-being). His palace at Versailles included such extravagances as crystal and gold fixtures, and copper fountain statues.

Growing resentment, along with the emergence of political treatises focusing on new conceptions of a just government, generated events such as the French Revolution (1789–99) in the late 18th century. People began to demand more freedom and more autonomy, and they were willing to fight for it.

## Rousseau's Conception of the State of Nature

Rousseau was not the first political theorist to imagine humanity's natural condition, outside a civil society—a hypothetical state of nature. English philosopher [Thomas Hobbes](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/key-figure-analysis/#Thomas_Hobbes), for example, famously argued in _Leviathan_ (1651) that the natural state of the human being is a war of all against all, that "the life of man [is] solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short." Humans are motivated, in Hobbes's view, purely by self-interest.

Rousseau, by contrast, conceived the natural condition in much gentler terms, believing humanity to be essentially noble, though he agreed with Hobbes that self-interest—more specifically, self-preservation—motivates human action. In addition, Rousseau was influenced by Locke's natural law account of human nature. According to Locke, human beings are naturally free and equal but are also governed by natural law. By this, he means those laws that applied to all people regardless of their customs, conventional laws, location, and generation. Moreover, human beings have natural rights, among which are life, liberty, and property.

In Rousseau's state of nature, human beings are also free to pursue their self-interest, uncoerced, and so uncorrupted by civil society. Self-interest is dominated by self-preservation, which, in turn, is tenuous in the state of nature. Indeed, natural liberty is shackled by instincts and desires. So, while people are free to do as they please, they are not free from their drives. Moreover, Rousseau maintains that property is not part of the natural condition but instead is a form of dependence.

In Rousseau's view people are also naturally good. This concept is contrary to the Christian doctrine (common to both Catholics and Protestants) of original sin, which states that every person is tainted from birth by the actions of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Thus, Rousseau's statement of his belief put him at odds with the dominant power in Europe; caused many of his works to be censured; and even endangered his life, liberty, and right to own property on numerous occasions.

In Rousseau's worldview, civil society is the mechanism whereby the natural condition is best supported. By collecting as a single political body, called the "Sovereign," human beings can express "the general will." This behavior is superior, Rousseau thinks, to giving up natural freedom for a sort of enslavement that comes with the protection provided by a monarch or other type of government that does not have an interest in their subjects' well-being. Instead, by associating under a contract, written or understood, the people give up natural freedom but gain both collective freedom and the tempering of their natural impulses. After all, in a society one cannot always do what one wants, because that may encroach on one's fellow citizens' freedoms.

## Rousseau's Influences

Rousseau engages with political theorists of the past and present in _The Social Contract_. Because he lived and worked during the apex of the French Enlightenment, whose thinkers—the _philosophes_—were influenced by the likes of English scientist Isaac Newton and English philosopher John Locke, Rousseau found himself at one of the centers of incredibly productive intellectual activity. The concept of natural law, for example, from Greek philosopher [Aristotle](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/key-figure-analysis/#Aristotle) through Italian priest Thomas Aquinas, and from Dutch jurist [Hugo Grotius](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/key-figure-analysis/#Hugo_Grotius) through English philosopher Thomas Hobbes, had become a core feature of political theories.

Rousseau's novel contributions to political theory stand out against the backdrop of these influences largely because he broke from the prevailing enthusiasm for human reason. Instead, he concentrated on human nature and the simultaneously aggravating and tempering influences of society. In addition, he did not side either with those who endorsed a monarchy as a way of escaping the savagery of the natural state or those who endorsed a civil society that exists in order to protect natural rights. On the former side were thinkers such as Hobbes and Grotius, while on the latter were the likes of Locke and French lawyer Montesquieu. While he agreed with some ideas and rejected others, his view of the state aligns best with the ancient Greeks, particularly Aristotle.

For Aristotle, the political life is ultimately indistinguishable from the good life. A citizen thrives because of the state and through his contributions to it. Similarly, Rousseau holds that civic life is essential to a citizen's freedom. The general will cannot be expressed without participating in public life.

#### Constitutions

Both France and the United States developed social contracts, or constitutions, after their revolutions. A constitution lays out the principles of a society, such as how the government is structured and organized, which rights are observed as existing naturally, and which rights are considered granted by the establishment of the constitution. A constitution may also establish the practices of administering the government.

#### Romantic Naturalism

The Enlightenment not only influenced Rousseau, Rousseau also influenced it. He was, however, not exclusively an Enlightenment thinker. Insofar as he was deeply committed to the value of the emotions, rather than the singular primacy of reason, Rousseau did not fit neatly into the common conceptions of the Enlightenment philosopher. His novel _Julie, or The New Heloise_ (1761) continuously set out the tensions between reason and emotion, the individual and societal norms, and the fundamental goodness of human nature and its corruption by society.

For Rousseau, nature and the human being's natural condition are not to be dominated, broken, and tamed. Indeed, one's natural state is a state of true freedom and goodness. Rousseau returned to this theme again in his novel on education, _Émile_ (1762), and he himself eventually chose to live a quietly solitary life studying nature. His later work, _Reveries of the Solitary Walker_ (1782), emphasize nature as a path to happiness. Through this study, he believed, one can properly become virtuous.

As a movement, Romantic Naturalism emphasized the immediacy of feeling and the concrete, albeit fleetingness, of nature. Such tangibility was contrasted with the arid abstraction of rationality favored so heavily in the Enlightenment.

#### Immanuel Kant

Perhaps Rousseau's most lasting mark on philosophy is in his effect on the groundbreaking German philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724–1804). Kant is said to have become so absorbed in _Émile_ that he forgot to take the daily walks that were otherwise so habitual that neighbors could set their clocks by them. In addition, Rousseau's portrait was the only image displayed in Kant's home.

In his "An Answer to the Question: What is Enlightenment?" (1784) Kant declares, "Sapere aude! Dare to know!" Given Kant's typically Enlightenment confidence in reason, it might seem strange that he was so affected by Rousseau. But like Rousseau, Kant understood reason's limits. In his _Critique of Pure Reason_ (1781), for example, Kant argues that the structure of human understanding limits knowledge to the empirical world, thereby restricting reason.

Rousseau's commitment to freedom—more specifically, independence—likely influenced the framework of Kant's thinking on politics and morality. In other words, Kant's clarion call, "Sapere aude!" has more in common with Rousseau than would seem to be the case at first glance. After all, Rousseau was deeply concerned with preserving human independence in the context of a civil society. Thinking for oneself is one such point of contact.

Still another is equality. Kant conceives of human beings as fundamentally of equal value. For Rousseau, the erosion of freedom is one way of generating inequality by dependence. For Kant, conduct that interferes with another person's freedom to make their own choices undermines their fundamental value. As Kant put it, it was Rousseau who taught him the value of humanity: "Rousseau set me right."

# Key Figure Analysis

## Aristotle

In contrast to Rousseau, Aristotle argued that human beings are not naturally equal. The two share the view, however, that a constitution establishes the common interest of the whole. Indeed, for Aristotle, the individual does not flourish outside the community, whose primary function is to promote and secure flourishing. Like his teacher, Plato, Aristotle's political theory is deeply connected to his ethical theory. For Aristotle, in fact, ethics is preparatory to politics.

## Hugo Grotius

Hugo Grotius's work profoundly influenced philosophy, law, political theory, and relevant areas of study. His contributions to natural law theory generally promote the view that certain societal norms have their basis in nature. Thus, acceptable and unacceptable behaviors are so by nature.

## Thomas Hobbes

Thomas Hobbes's political philosophy is derived from his view that reality is exclusively material, which is to say, only material things exist. According to Hobbes, outside of a social contract, human life is miserable. It is only by entering into a compact that individuals have a chance of living well—or at least, more safely than they are alone. Hobbes's view vests authority and responsibility in an individual sovereign.

## Niccolò Machiavelli

Niccolò Machiavelli is often called the father of modern political philosophy. His seminal work, _The Prince_, offers advice to would-be rulers. This advice focuses on what a would-be prince should do to retain power.

## Charles-Louis de Secondat, baron de La Brède and de Montesquieu

Montesquieu articulated a theory of the separation of governmental powers. This view was influential on framers of subsequent constitutions.

## Plato

Along with Aristotle, Plato is one of the greatest philosophers. Having written on virtually every subject, Plato's philosophy is systematic. This means, in part, that his political theory is intimately connected with his theories of reality (metaphysics) and knowledge (epistemology). According to Plato, only a republic ruled by philosopher kings and queens will be just.

# Summary

## Summary

_The Social Contract_ is an extract from a larger—and never completed—work, _Political Institutions_. Its systematic focus is on the essential conditions of a legitimate state. The opening line of Chapter 1 distills the central problem [Jean-Jacques Rousseau](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/author/) sets out to solve: "Man is born free; and everywhere, he is in chains." According to Rousseau, modern society has circumscribed humans' natural freedom and equality, shackling them in the chains of dependence.

No society is legitimate if it generates inequality and makes people dependent on artificially created necessities, each other, and a ruler. The only civil society that deserves its name is one that expresses the general will. Rousseau calls a collection of people who freely enter into society with each other a _Sovereign_. Multiple individuals become one body, with one voice. The aim of the Sovereign is to preserve and promote the common good, which Rousseau takes to be security, liberty, and equality.

The Sovereign expresses the general will, while an independent lawgiver—a noncitizen—codifies that will into law. A government is then organized to implement those laws. Rousseau does not specify what form that government takes, though he proposes the main options: democracy, aristocracy, and monarchy. Each may be suitable to a given state, depending on a variety of factors, and he points out some benefits and flaws of each.

Because tensions between the Sovereign and the government naturally arise, whereby the latter works against the general will, Rousseau insists that the Sovereign must convene at regular intervals to reassert its authority. At these assemblies each citizen must vote for what they take to be the general will rather than their own particular interests. They may be incorrect about what that general will is and so vote against it, but the majority wins. Ideally, there will be unanimity, as each citizen tends to understand what is common to all.

A citizen's vote, Rousseau argues, cannot be farmed out to a representative. Because the citizen is an essential part of the Sovereign and because it is imperative that the Sovereign express the general will, each citizen's vote keeps the state alive.

Rousseau considers the role of religion in the state. After reviewing ways in which religion and political life have historically existed, he proposes a civil religion. It alone can inspire citizens of the state to the sort of virtue found in civic duty, which informs the general will.

# Book 1, Chapters 1–6 | Summary

## Summary

### Book 1, Chapter 1: Subject of the First Book

Before beginning Chapter 1, [Jean-Jacques Rousseau](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/author/) tells his reader that his project is to investigate whether or not, given human beings as they are, a legitimate rule of law can be established. The aim is to "unite what right sanctions with what is prescribed by interest," because what is right and what is in an individual's interest may not always coincide.

Rousseau goes on to announce his reason for writing a work on politics. It is precisely because he is neither "a prince [nor] a legislator." Were he one or the other, he could simply enact his ideas rather than propose them in a treatise. Finally, it is because he is "a citizen of a free State," with a corresponding right to vote, he takes it as his "duty" to study "public affairs."

To begin Chapter 1, Rousseau declares, "Man is born free; and everywhere, he is in chains." The project in the first chapter is to discern when the change from freedom to the imprisonment of social constraints occurred and what political authority can legitimize it.

When people are "compelled to obey," regaining freedom by force is justified. As Rousseau points out, those forced into obedience are "justified in resuming [liberty], or there was no justification for those who took it away." At the same time, Rousseau claims, society is both "a sacred right" and the foundation for all other rights. Rights are not derived, then, from nature, but convention. Rousseau declares that an argument for this claim is the topic of the following chapters.

### Book 1, Chapter 2: The First Societies

The family is the "most ancient of all societies" and the only society that is natural to humans. Children are dependent on their fathers in order to survive, though this dependence ends when they can fend for themselves. Concurrently, a father is responsible for the child until that child becomes independent, at which time the father, too, is freed. As Rousseau writes, at this point "the natural bond is dissolved." If the family remains intact, it is by choice, and so by convention.

Liberty is man's natural state. According to Rousseau, an individual's responsibility is only to self-preservation. It is up to the individual, when able to care for themselves, to determine the best means of doing so. In this way he "becomes his own master."

The family provides "the first model of political societies." A society's ruler is like the father, and the people that constitute the rest of society are like the children. The bond between them, that by which their liberty is restricted, is established "only for their own advantage." Before that, they are each entirely free, and all are equal. Political authority is not, then, derived from natural authority, such as found in families. Rousseau points out that, unlike the love a father has for his dependent children, a ruler feels "the pleasure of commanding" subjects. What is in the interests of the ruled may not be of interest to the ruler, and the natural authority found in families does not transfer over to a political authority.

According to Rousseau, thinkers such as Grotius, Hobbes, Caligula, and [Aristotle](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/key-figure-analysis/#Aristotle) consider the relation between ruler and ruled as natural (i.e., there are people whose natural condition is to be ruled by those superior to them) as a shepherd rules a flock because he is superior to them. Rousseau rejects this position, arguing that it is force, not nature, that creates rulers and ruled, and it is only by cowardice that anyone remains a slave.

### Book 1, Chapter 3: The Right of the Strongest

Rousseau continues his argument against both a conception of ruling and ruled as a natural condition, and, more generally, against society as a natural state of man. At the outset of Chapter 3 he writes, "The strongest is never strong enough to be always the master," unless he resorts to lies and tyranny. Rousseau rejects the justice of this transformation. The "physical power" of force wielded by a ruler does not yield a "moral effect" in those ruled. Yielding or succumbing to force is not an act of will and cannot, consequently, be a duty.

Assuming, on the other hand, that a right can be generated through force, Rousseau concludes that "the sole result is an inexplicable mass of nonsense." This is because with each force greater to the one previous to it, a new right is established. Now, suppose that one is strong enough to get away with disobeying authority. This means that one is not forced to obey. Rousseau argues that force obviates duty, so when force is no longer a reason to obey, there is nothing else to compel one to do so. In other words, if people recognize and obey authority, then it is because they are forced to do so. In that case, they do not obey because they believe they ought to do so. But, when the moment comes that they are not forced to obey, there is no other motivation to do so. Consequently, claiming that force generates right results in the aforementioned "inexplicable mass of nonsense." Rousseau concludes that "we are obliged to obey only legitimate powers."

### Book 1, Chapter 4: Slavery

Because human beings are naturally equal, and because force cannot establish a right, Rousseau concludes, "conventions form the basis of all legitimate authority among men." Giving up one's natural freedom to be ruled requires something in exchange. [Hugo Grotius](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/key-figure-analysis/#Hugo_Grotius) proposes that the individual's ability to "alienate his liberty and make himself the slave of a master" can be expanded to "a whole people," who could become subjects of a king. Rousseau asserts that there must be something subjects receive for relinquishing or effectively selling their liberty. Yet, while a king lives off the products of his subjects' labor, the people gain nothing in return. The claim that they gain security is undermined, Rousseau argues, by the fact that the king can send his people to war.

No sane person would turn over his freedom without gaining anything in return. Such an agreement would be void, given "the mere fact that he who does it is out of his mind." Giving up one's freedom for nothing is not only not a legitimate covenant, or contract, but it also does not extend to one's children, who are born free; "their liberty belongs to them, and no one but they has the right to dispose of it."

Indeed, no contract in which one gives up one's freedom is legitimate. "To renounce liberty," Rousseau writes, "is to renounce being a man." The moment one's freedom has been relinquished, one is no longer in a position to demand anything. This, Rousseau argues, is a simple contradiction, fostering "on the one side, absolute authority, and, on the other, unlimited obedience." Another way to put the contradiction is as follows: the master owns the slave and so also the slave's rights. The master, then, has a right against himself.

Rousseau also rejects Grotius's argument that the right of slavery can be derived from war. When one society vanquishes another, the "victor" supposedly has "the right of killing the vanquished." The price of life is slavery. Because there is an advantage to each, it is supposed, the arrangement is thought to be legitimate. Rousseau argues that the inference from war to slavery is erroneous.

War, Rousseau maintains, "is constituted by a relation between things, and not between persons." That is, wars are waged between states over property and resources. As such, they are not about individuals. When wars end, enemies revert to being human beings, with all that Rousseau believes that entails. Consequently, it does not serve as an analogue to individuals submitting themselves to a form of slavery.

Moreover, the exchange of slavery for life, Rousseau argues, is based on an erroneous right. A victor is not entitled to the lives of the vanquished. Indeed, "there is a vicious circle in" inferring a right to enslave from a right to kill or let live, and conversely in inferring a right to kill of let live from a right to enslave. The words, "slave" and "right" are themselves contradictory, Rousseau objects, insofar as the one who enslaves enters into an arrangement that is entirely to their advantage.

### Book 1, Chapter 5: That We Must Always Go Back to a First Convention

Rousseau continues his argument against the general concept of the rule of might, be it by force, entering into slavery, or the spoils of war—in short, against despotism. Even if the arguments of the previous chapters are not convincing, Rousseau maintains, despotic rule does not reflect a society but merely a situation in which there is a master and slaves.

Moreover, Rousseau argues, an important point about the relation between ruler and ruled is missing on standard accounts of the generation of political authority. For example, even on Grotius's view that a political authority is established when people give themselves over to a king, there is still the assumption that a society exists to be ruled. In other words, "a people is a people before it gives itself." Already, then, society has been formed out of the natural state of individuals freely and independently pursuing their own interests.

What is required of an investigation into the formation of a society is how individuals initially collected in order to give themselves over to a king. As Rousseau points out, a "convention" must already be established if some people in a society want a master, while others do not. "The law of majority voting is itself something established by convention."

### Book 1, Chapter 6: The Social Compact

The origin of society, and a contract which binds members together, is the subject of Chapter 6. Rousseau has already proposed the view that the natural state of individuals is freedom and independence. In that condition an individual's sole responsibility is self-preservation. A point is reached, however, at which the challenges to maintaining that state are too great: "The human race would perish unless it changed its manner of existence." Individuals must band together in order to survive. The key, Rousseau maintains, is for individuals to unite without losing "the force and liberty" that "are the chief instruments of [that individual's] self-preservation." More specifically, Rousseau declares that such a union of individuals must preserve the individual's self-mastery and freedom.

The book, Rousseau claims, is the solution to the problem of maintaining the individual freedom from obedience to others. The essential terms of the contract Rousseau presents are as follows: all citizens subordinate their individual wills to the general will; in turn, they become an indivisible whole.

It is imperative that the individual completely and unconditionally join in the whole, for without doing so, there can be no "general will." From this, it follows that the individual does not maintain rights that oppose the formal whole, or state. At the same time, however, because those entering into the contract are equals, their natural freedom is preserved. Moreover, because individuals who enter into the contract wish to preserve their freedom, the contract must not be burdensome and complicated. Through this manner of association, Rousseau asserts, "a moral and collective body" is created, a "public person," in which each individual's vote counting as equally as another member's. That "moral and collective body," or "public person," is called a _Republic_ or _body politic_.

Rousseau concludes the chapter by introducing further terminology to denote features of the contractual society: members call their society "_State_, when passive, _Sovereign_ when active, and _Power_ when compared with others like itself." Members of the society are, collectively, _people_, and as individuals in that collective are _citizens_. Citizens share "in sovereign power," while as _subjects_ they fall "under the laws of the State."

## Analysis

[Rousseau](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/author/)'s central aim is to reconcile human nature with civil society. According to Rousseau, because that nature is not inclined to society, and because it is corrupted by it, the challenge is to convince people to want what is right. According to Rousseau, there is a need for a social contract, but not just any contract will suffice. A legitimate social contract is one that voices the general for the common good.

Rousseau begins the formal body of _The Social Contract_ with what is now one of the most famous lines in philosophical literature: "Man is born free; and everywhere, he is in chains." The quote distills the central concept in Rousseau's political philosophy. The foundations of a civil society are illegitimate when they restrict freedom and, typically as a result, generate inequality. One who is wealthier than their neighbors, for example, has more power. Rousseau, like [Plato](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/key-figure-analysis/#Plato), rejects the argument that might—in whatever form that takes—makes right.

Instead, Rousseau situates morality squarely in the realm of freedom. When he claims that yielding to force is not an act of will, and so cannot be a duty, Rousseau clearly expresses the view that a coercive political authority is not morally binding. This point helps clarify Rousseau's previous claim, in Chapter 1, that anyone compelled to obey is justified in shirking off the yoke by force.

Because Rousseau uses terminology unfamiliar to the contemporary reader, or uses it in unfamiliar ways, it is worthwhile to clarify it. The _general will_, which is named the _Republic_ or _body politic_, is significant. Once individuals enter into a social compact or contract, the resulting body is an entity with its own will. The collection of people who enter into a civil society becomes one; hence, the term _Sovereign_.

## Summary

### Book 1, Chapter 7: The Sovereign

In the "mutual undertaking" of contracting, the members of a Sovereign serve in two different capacities. One binds them to individuals, while the other binds them to the Sovereign. The Sovereign itself only has one capacity. In action (that is, as a legislative body engaged in the creation of laws), the Sovereign is not a subject. As such, it is not beholden to its own legislation. The practical reason for this is that legislation needs to adapt to changing conditions. Conceptually, [Jean-Jacques Rousseau](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/author/) asserts that it is self-contradictory to hold that the Sovereign is bound to itself, such that it would be bound to its own authority.

The Sovereign is, however, bound not to violate the contract, because that agreement makes possible its very existence. Related to this prohibition is another one against doing anything against that agreement: "for instance, to alienate any part of itself, or to submit to another Sovereign."

The Sovereign, as a unified body, cannot "offend against one of the members without attacking the body," so that it is the state's—or Sovereign's—interest not to harm one of its members but instead to act in favor of their interests, despite not being bound to do so. In addition, any offense against the body itself creates resentment among its members. "Duty and interest" emerge to secure the subjects' relations to each other and the Sovereign, as well as the Sovereign's relation to its subjects. The dual capacity of a Sovereign's members makes this reciprocity possible.

The body comprises individuals and consequently has no "interest contrary to theirs." Moreover, "because it is impossible for the body to wish to hurt all its members," there is no reason for that body to provide its subjects with guarantees. On the other hand, subjects require laws to maintain their loyalty to the Sovereign. After all, Rousseau points out, some members "may wish to enjoy the rights of citizenship without [fulfilling] the duties of a subject." A continued state "of this injustice [would be] the undoing of the body politic."

In order for the social contract Rousseau proposes to be more than "an empty formula," it must include the condition that the whole body compel anyone who "refuses to obey the general will"—which is to say, anyone who does not obey the state "will be forced to be free." According to Rousseau, this condition "alone legitimizes civil undertakings, which, without it, would be absurd, tyrannical, and liable to the most frightful abuses."

### Book 1, Chapter 8: The Civil State

Rousseau moves on in Chapter 8 to consider the effects on the individual of entering into a social contract. Justice and morality substitute for instinctive actions. The voice of duty is substituted for "physical impulses and right of appetite." In this way, the individual is forced to rationally consider actions and act on principles different from pure self-preservation and inclination. The freedom lost in existing nature is more than made up for in what is gained in a civil society. Among the benefits are the stimulation and development of one's faculties and the cultivation and ennobling of one's feelings. In short, one moves from being "a stupid and unimaginative animal" to "an intelligent being and a man." Reason and the general will, having replaced instinct and freedom, guide subjects in the direction of improvement.

### Book 1, Chapter 9: Real Property

When an individual "gives himself to" a civil state, he also gives "all the resources at his command, including the goods he possesses." This does not, however, entail relinquishing one's property. For insofar as the individual is also a subject of the state, the state has an interest in protecting what has been acquired in the state of nature.

Legitimate, or "real" property rights are secured by being "the first occupier." One could have acquired one's property by force, but Rousseau has already discounted it as a legitimate method. Instead, because everyone has a right to what they need to survive, and given that one works and cultivates property not already occupied—rather than taken "by an empty ceremony"—and not greater than what is necessary for survival, it follows that one has a right to property.

## Analysis

The Sovereign meets individuals where and how they are. In other words, [Jean-Jacques Rousseau](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/author/) is not interested in creating a political structure out of whole cloth. Instead, he takes an empirical approach. So, while he offers a theoretical conception of the natural condition of the human being, he does not theorize about the myriad conditions in which people find themselves. So, for example, he does not assume that people live in the same geographical conditions—some live in coastal areas, others inland.

Rousseau is also interested in discussing the benefits of society. The reader does well to remember that Rousseau's criticism of modern life, so forcefully articulated in the opening line of the book, is a criticism of historical and current political structures, which include property ownership and other inequities. His remedy, founded on the belief in human beings' natural moral equality and goodness, and natural freedom, is to channel, not to transform. This is partly why he eschews dictating certain features of the political structure, such as the type of government a state should adopt (i.e., democracy, aristocracy, or monarchy).

What Rousseau is adamant about is the fundamental constitution of the body politic, the Sovereign. For people to agree to enter into a social contract, they must believe there is a common good that outweighs a continued solitary existence. Moreover, they must believe that harm to one is harm to all; that harm to the state is harm to all. If they do not share this belief, they will not grasp the significance of Rousseau's claim that, entering the social contract, one is "forced to be free," as he points out in Chapter 4.

Taking responsibility for action makes us better, which is one benefit of the civil state. The practically absolute freedom in nature, which amounts to the freedom from coercion by others, is attended by a lack of responsibility toward others. By entering into a social contract, one takes others' interests into account, which eventually leads to the general will concerned with promoting the common good. As Rousseau points out in Chapter 8, everything a person loses by the social contract he gains in guaranteed liberties.

## Summary

### Book 2, Chapter 1: That Sovereignty Is Inalienable

The point of the social contract is the common good. Consequently, "the general will alone can direct the State according to the object for which it was instituted." Sovereignty, [Rousseau](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/author/) declares, is "nothing less than the exercise of the general will." The "collective being" known as the Sovereign—the passive condition of the term—asserts its will through the actions of its members. The people as a whole, not a subdivision, for example, express the general will. That will, in turn, is expressed in law, which is the result of the Sovereign's activities. How that law is applied is the expression of a particular will. Thus, the particular will "tends, by its very nature, to partiality, while the general will tends to equality." The individual, or particular will, privileges a part of society, while the general will privileges the whole.

The particular and general wills do not always coincide; they can (however rare that alignment is). Consequently, Rousseau maintains that their coincidence cannot be guaranteed. Consequently, only obedience to the general will is possible; one cannot obey this or that authority, because it is nothing other than a particular will. The moment a citizen hands over their liberty to an authority, the Sovereign is dead.

### Book 2, Chapter 2: That Sovereignty Is Indivisible

Sovereignty is, in addition to being inalienable, is also indivisible. Its indivisibility derives from two sources: first, the entire body of citizens that generates the general will, which requires that "all votes be counted," without formally excluding anyone. Second, Sovereignty cannot be divided into types of power, branches of government, and so forth. There are "emanations from it." In other words, the Sovereign's powers are not equivalent to the powers derived from it. Consequently, the Sovereign's powers cannot be divided. This is just what thinkers such as [Hugo Grotius](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/key-figure-analysis/#Hugo_Grotius) propose, however, when investing power in a ruler.

Rousseau provides an example of the difference between Sovereignty and the powers derived from it. Declarations of war and peace, he maintains, are not exercises of sovereignty but the application of law generated by it. The law provides instruction for the appropriate declarations and authorization of the power to make them, but these are not themselves law.

### Book 2, Chapter 3: Whether the General Will Is Fallible

Rousseau argues that the general will is infallible. Rousseau reminds the reader of a previous claim, namely that the general will tends toward the common good. It does not follow from this, however, "that the deliberations of the people are always equally correct." People can be deceived or may fail to correctly identify the good. The general will cannot. Moreover, the general will is distinguished from the "will of all," which considers "private interest," while the general will does not. Consequently, the "will of all" is simply the "sum of particular wills."

The general will accounts for everyone—no one is formally prevented from a vote. Consequently, Rousseau thinks, when informed citizens deliberate on what to do, without influencing each other in any way, the general will will emerge. Citizens may differ in terms of their particular wills, but, because these "private wills" clash, it is easy to see they do not represent the general will—an individual's private interests are not likely identical with everyone else's. When factions form, however, the distinction between the private and general wills is harder to discern. These are precluded, and public discourse protected from corruption, Rousseau thinks, by preventing citizens from communicating during deliberation on proposed public policies. Thinking for oneself is the order of the day.

### Book 2, Chapter 5: The Limits of Sovereign Power

Rousseau continues the metaphor of the Sovereign as a body in Chapter 4. The state is, more specifically, "a moral person whose life is in the union of its members." This arrangement does not eliminate the individual, insofar as the state's absolute authority over him does not extend to every particular of his life. The state cannot, for example, take more from a citizen than is required. In addition, the state speaks for the citizen to the extent that it is relevant to society as a whole; that is, in terms of what is relevant to the common good. Otherwise, the citizen pursues their own interests.

### Book 2, Chapter 5: The Right of Life and Death

The Sovereign's right extends to life and death. In other words, the state has the authority to implement the death penalty in order to preserve the social contract. One violates the social contract when one violates sovereign laws. Consequently, "he must be removed by exile as a violator of the compact, or by death as a public enemy." That individual is an enemy because, according to Rousseau, "such an enemy is not a moral person, but merely a man." Recalling the right of war, Rousseau concludes the vanquished enemy is to be killed.

### Book 2, Chapter 6: Law

Having articulated the origin of the social contract, Rousseau turns his attention to how the body politic, or the Sovereign, is maintained. The social contract brings the "body politic" to life; laws, Rousseau maintains, "give it movement and will."

Laws are required to protect members of society from those who would do others harm. According to Rousseau, "the object of laws is always general": laws consider subjects as a whole and their actions as "abstract, never a particular person or action." Moreover, "the law unites universality of will with universality of object." Consequently, laws aim at the common good.

## Analysis

"Sovereignty" and "the general will" can be taken as synonymous terms. Indeed, people are sovereign—in their collective voice is vested authority—when they speak with one voice; that is, when they express the general will.

The general will is infallible. [Jean-Jacques Rousseau](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/author/) has already claimed that by the mere fact it exists, the Sovereign is always everything it ought to be. Particular wills can and do conflict with the general will; that is, individuals are inclined to pursue their self-interests rather than those common to all. These common interests include safety, clean water, and food. For Rousseau common interests are reflective of equality, while individual interests are reflective of partiality. Consequently, when one goes against the common interest, one goes against equality, for one does not take everyone else into account. When one realizes the superiority of the general will over the particular will, one realizes that in the general will, one's own most important interests are respected. Error occurs, then, when one exerts one's will contrary to the general will.

# Book 2, Chapters 7–12 | Summary

## Summary

### Book 2, Chapter 7: The Legislator

Legislators create laws, beginning with a constitution. However, good legislators are not easily found. This is because they must be very intelligent and insightful, and able to codify the general will. In so doing, they shape the character of the state, turning brutes into men. Moreover, legislators must not be citizens of the state for which they write laws. So, while as such they are exempt from the Sovereign, they are also unable to participate in governing.

Finding suitable legislators is not the only hurdle to be overcome. The legislator is confronted with a collection of individuals with no understanding of the principles that underlie laws. Those individuals also must be transformed into "substituting a partial and moral existence for the independent and physical existence nature has conferred."

Obedience to the law is not a given. [Rousseau](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/author/) points out that the necessity of law as proof of this claim. As he writes, if it were a given, "men would have to be before law what they should become by means of law." Reason and force do not serve as authorities, so another must suffice. According to Rousseau, the legislator "must have recourse to an authority ... capable of constraining without violence and persuading without convincing." Historically, divine authority has served this purpose. This does not mean, however, that religion and politics share a common purpose. Instead, religion serves a political purpose.

### Book 2, Chapter 8: The People

Rousseau has argued that people need to be convinced to obey laws. In Chapter 8 he focuses on the condition in which the people must be in, in order to be so convinced. Just as an architect must assess the conditions of the site on which a structure is to be built, so also a legislator must ascertain "the fitness of the people." Rousseau believes there is a period of youth for nations, just as for people, "before which they should not be made subject to laws." He concedes, however, that "the maturity of a people is not always easily recognizable." Societies that are not developed sufficiently cannot follow laws, despite their goodness.

### Book 2, Chapter 9: The People, Continued

Ideally, people are mature enough to embrace law. In addition, ideally there will not be too many people in a social contract. For government to be effective, society cannot be too large. For a society to be secure, it cannot be too small.

Smaller states are preferable to larger ones, because the latter can be cumbersome and inflexible. As Rousseau points out, "Long distances make administration more difficult, just as a weight becomes heavier at the end of a longer lever." Moreover, larger, far-flung societies dilute the feelings citizens have for each other and for their leader. Given that the general will relies on both, such a situation is untenable.

### Book 2, Chapter 10: The People, Continued

Rousseau's final chapter on "the People" focuses on the size of the state and the type of person best suited to it. The state's laws ought to ensure self-sufficiency, because without self-sufficiency, dependency on other states and military aggression become modes of survival. At the same time, a state that is overly productive is subject to aggression from those states wanting its resources.

There is no precise algorithm by which this balance can be achieved. Rousseau points out that multiple factors must be taken into account when thinking about the appropriate size and development of the state. These include the territory's geography, the variety of its natural resources, and the willingness of its people to contribute to its welfare.

Rousseau concludes the chapter with a list of characteristics of the people "fit" for legislation. This list also encapsulates the most significant features of what Rousseau takes to be the most successful type of state.

They are a people:

- unified in some way but not already bound by law
- not superstitious or who have an ingrained culture
- not in danger of being invaded, or having allies to come to its defense
- immune to neighbors' disputes
- whose members all know each other
- capable of individual self-sufficiency
- not poor or wealthy but self-sufficient
- possessing "the consistency of an ancient people [combined] with the docility of a new one."

### Book 2, Chapter 11: The Various Systems of Legislation

Rousseau next sets out to discuss the purpose of law and how the state is to fulfill that purpose. To achieve "the greatest good of all," which is the ultimate purpose of the state, laws must promote and protect "liberty and equality." Each is essential, but equality is necessary for liberty.

Liberty here is "civil liberty," the independence of members in a society to pursue their own interests. Equality is, Rousseau claims, not identical power or riches, for example, but the prevention of any one person having so great a power or wealth over any other or others such that the latter's liberty is threatened or eliminated. More specifically, when one is dependent on another whose power or wealth effectively creates that dependence, one loses one's liberty. This, in turn, results in a weakening of the state.

Preserving liberty and equality, given the variables described in Chapter 10, means there is no exact formula. Each state is modified according to its own peculiarities, or "in accordance with the local situation and the temper of the inhabitants"; all these should determine the systems best for that particular state.

### Book 2, Chapter 12: The Division of the Laws

The final chapter in Book 2 is concerned with the classification of the laws of the state, each of which focuses on a relation between institutions, between individuals and institutions, and among members of the society. The constitutional laws are "political laws." These concern the relation between the Sovereign and the state by setting out the rights and duties the Sovereign determines for the state. If they are wise, these laws are also called "fundamental laws."

The second and third classifications concern laws that govern citizens' relations to each other. Civil and criminal laws, respectively, maintain citizens' independence from each other, while preserving their dependence on the state. The fourth classification is not codified law, as are the others, but instead law imprinted "on the hearts of the citizens." Moral law is, according to Rousseau, "the most important of all," because, more than any written law, it is what preserves a society. Though "a power unknown to political thinkers, [it is one] none the less [on which] success in everything else depends." In "secret," the legislator crafts laws that aim at generating citizens who will the general good.

## Analysis

Freedom is foundational to [Jean-Jacques Rousseau](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/author/)'s project. Indeed, the entire book is organized around it. As Rousseau points out at the beginning of Chapter 11, the legislation has two main goals: "liberty, because all particular dependence means so much force taken from the body of the State" and equality, which Rousseau claims is essential to liberty. The key to a successful civil society, then, is to understand and relate freedom in its various aspects: natural, civil, and moral. Any encroachment on freedom weakens the state by creating dependence.

Rousseau has already argued that citizens who will uphold the general good are going to hold the society together. Through the society's mores, customs, and education, this goodwill is developed. So, while every society contains members who have more or less than others (for example property) with the cultivation of thinking about the common good, such inequality does not become immoral. In other words, Rousseau essentially associates morality with liberty, or freedom and equality. Equality might be construed as "equity." For example, not everyone is of equal height or weight or baseline health. Not everyone has equal talents and aptitudes. In short, sameness does not obtain. To the extent that there is a common good, however, one willed by all people, there is impartiality or fairness.

# Book 3, Chapters 1–6 | Summary

## Summary

### Book 3, Chapter 1: The Government in General

[Jean-Jacques Rousseau](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/author/) begins Book 3 with a comparison between an individual and the state. Free action in the individual, Rousseau explains, involves a moral and a physical component. The moral component consists in "the will which determines the act;" the physical component consists in "the power which executes" what the will has determined to do. Similarly, "the body politic has the same motive powers."

Rousseau reviews the relevant idea from previous chapters: the people have "the legislative power" that embodies the general will. In this chapter Rousseau presents the executive branch as the government or "supreme administration"; it carries out the general will. He defines government as "an intermediate body set up between the subjects and the Sovereign, to secure their mutual correspondence." Its mission is to execute laws and maintain civil and political liberty. This body consists of magistrates, kings, or governors. The governmental body as a whole, Rousseau calls _prince_. It is this individual "entrusted with" administering the government.

The government holds "the intermediate forces" that bind the Sovereign with the state, or the people to themselves as the state. It effectively carries out the general will, and as such holds the subjects, the people, to their own will. Hence, government is "the legitimate exercise of executive power."

### Book 3, Chapter 2: The Constituent Principle in the Various Forms of Government

Just as he distinguished, in principle, between the state and the Sovereign, Rousseau here distinguishes "between government and its principle." There is proportionality between the number of subjects and Sovereign, but because "the total force of the government" is "invariable," greater numbers of magistrates weakens it. Rousseau explains how this works in terms of the "will." The magistrate represents, essentially, three different wills. There is the private will of the individual. This will tends exclusively to its own advantage. There is also the magistrates' common will. This will, which Rousseau also calls the "corporate will," is connected with that which is advantageous to the "prince"—the person or body that controls the state day to day. Lastly, there is "the will of the people or the sovereign will," which Rousseau thinks is the most general will of the state as a whole, and the government, which is part of the whole.

According to Rousseau, a "perfect act of legislation" involves the subordination of these wills. More specifically, the individual will should be negligible, because the point of legislation is to guarantee the good of all, and the individual will does not share interests with any others. It is, then, subordinate to "the corporate will," which consists of individuals—magistrates—with shared interests. The corporate will, in turn, is subordinate to the sovereign or general will, which reflects the common interests of the citizenry.

Magistrates can be influenced by either of the two subordinate wills, the individual one of which is naturally the strongest. Each person wants legislation favorable to their individual interests. Secondarily, factions that constitute a corporate will are interested in laws that serve their institutional interests.

A related topic is the efficiency of the government. A small one is more flexible and nimbler; a single ruler, for example, is most efficient, for "promptitude in execution diminishes as more people are put in charge of it." Efficiency is not, however, identical with "rectitude."

### Book 3, Chapter 3: The Division of Governments

In Chapter 2 Rousseau distinguished the "kinds or forms of government" by the number of their members. In this chapter he sets out "to discover how the division is made." He lists three possible divisions: the government or executive branch can be democratic, by the whole or majority of the people; it can be aristocratic, by a restriction of "the government to the hands of a small number"; or it can be a monarchy, in which power is concentrated in a single individual. Rousseau points out that no one form is best but that the context determines which one is most suited to the situation.

### Book 3, Chapter 4: Democracy

Having laid out the three commonest forms of government, Rousseau spends the next three chapters discussing each. The first, democracy, like the others, has strengths and weaknesses. A democratic government is not the same as the general will. Rousseau has already pointed out that sovereignty, or the general will, makes law, and the executive branch, or government, carries it out.

Rousseau notes three problems with a democratic form of government. First, there is no separation of powers between the Sovereign (legislative branch) and the government (executive branch). Consequently, there is no mechanism whereby citizens are accountable to the general will. Second, a lack of separation also undermines the aforementioned priority of the general over the particular will. "Nothing," Rousseau writes, "is more dangerous that the influence of private interests on public affairs," which are corrupted by it. Third, there is a practical problem: administration of the government is intractable with many people involved.

Nevertheless, Rousseau does recommend this form of government under certain conditions. First, the state must be small. He has already pointed out the importance of a manageable size, as it facilitates citizens knowing every other citizen, thereby increasing the propensity of promoting the general will. People are likely to be more considerate and more concerned about each other when these others are known. In addition, a small state is more likely to cultivate virtue than a large one.

Second, a democratic government should maintain a "simplicity of manners" in order not to become bogged down in the complexities of multiple interests. Third, a democracy cannot allow inequality, specifically in terms "of rank and fortune." Fourth, and last, a democracy must eschew luxury, because "it corrupts at once rich and poor, the rich by possession and the poor by covetousness." In short, luxury is contrary to morality.

### Book 3, Chapter 5: Aristocracy

An aristocracy, or rule of the few, Rousseau explains, is the best form of government. Sovereignty is vested in the people, but given the practicalities of running a government, an aristocracy is the most efficient. It is, he asserts, the oldest. Traceable to the first civilizations, aristocracy is akin to familial societies, where a father rules over his children, guided by his natural love for them. This initial situation changes, Rousseau maintains, as the society grows. Elective rule eventually consolidates into the hands of the wealthy and powerful, who then transfer it by heredity. Hereditary aristocracy, Rousseau thinks, is "the worst of all governments."

According to Rousseau, natural aristocracy, elected aristocracy, and hereditary aristocracy each provide particular benefits and share some common characteristics. For example, an aristocratic government is easily convened, and discussion is both more orderly and effective and thereby efficient. Rousseau also asserts that an aristocratic government is respected more by other states than the alternative forms of government. A small society, however, is essential to maintaining it.

Of the three forms of aristocracy, Rousseau favors elected government. He points out, however, that the election of magistrates is legitimate when the criteria for choosing them do not include wealth and power but instead their morals, "enlightenment," and "experience." Moreover, while an aristocracy should be larger than a democracy, it should not be large enough for magistrates to exert their individual wills. An aristocracy can also sustain more inequality than can a democracy, but there should still be "moderation on the side of the rich and contentment on that of the poor." Such inequality, Rousseau maintains, facilitates the magistrates' work on behalf of its citizens.

### Book 3, Chapter 6: Monarchy

A monarchy is, according to Rousseau, the least desirable form of governments. A monarchy is a form of government in which there is a single head. Its single asset is its efficiency, because "all the springs of the machine are in the same hands" and are oriented toward the same end.

It is, however, a form of government with three significant flaws: One is that it relies on the oppression of a weak people "unable to resist" the monarch who seeks absolute power. The second is that monarchs are typically "merely petty blunderers, petty swindlers, and petty intriguers"; as such, they are "inept." The third is that a monarchy is naturally unstable. A monarchy is maintained through succession; when one king dies, there may be a gap in time before another ruler is elected. During that time, Rousseau contends, "intrigue and corruption" dominate the citizenry, leading to instability.

## Analysis

In Books 1 and 2 [Rousseau](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/author/) is concerned with articulating the basic principles whereby liberty and equality are preserved in a civil society. Sovereignty and law together maintain both, which exist and function universally, rather than at the level of particularity. Consequently, they serve everyone and no one in particular.

In Book 3 Rousseau turns his attention from the founding of the state to its governance. The government is distinct from the Sovereign, which is constituted by the citizens. It is the government's role to enforce the general will, which is associated with right. In other words, it is the government's role to implement the laws created to protect the common good. "The members of [the government] are called magistrates or kings, that is to say governors;" the name _prince_ belongs to the whole governmental body. (The term is adopted from [Niccolò Machiavelli](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/key-figure-analysis/#Niccol%C3%B2_Machiavelli) and refers simply to those who govern.)

Rousseau is interested in advising readers on various political institutions: democracy, aristocracy, and monarchy. He is also interested in offering advice on tempering governmental intrusion into Sovereignty. Though he is convinced that no state lasts forever—one need only look to the Roman Republic, for example—he does think there are strategies for maintaining a healthy state for as long as possible.

Rousseau takes seriously the tension between the government and the Sovereign. The former will always be ready to impede upon the latter, so it is imperative that the citizens remain vigilant. The general will cannot be maintained if a particular will, or faction of wills (corporate wills), dominates.

For this reason Rousseau favors an aristocracy over a democracy or a monarchy. Both a direct democracy (Rousseau disdains representative democracy as heralding the death of the Sovereign) and a monarchy eliminate the distinction between the legislative and executive branches (i.e., collapses the Sovereign and the government into one). The first is impractical—too many voices or cooks in the kitchen means nothing gets done. The second precludes the possibility of a general will.

# Book 3, Chapters 7–11 | Summary

## Summary

### Book 3, Chapter 7: Mixed Governments

[Jean-Jacques Rousseau](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/author/)'s discussion of a monarchical form of government is followed by a caveat in Chapter 7: A king always has a number of subordinates to carry out a variety of tasks. There is, in other words, "no such thing as a simple Government." That said, a simple government, by virtue of its simplicity, is best, although the best government, as with any form of government, depends on the empirical conditions.

Rousseau spends the remainder of the chapter discussing two opposite problems for any state: too much strength and too little strength. A government that is too strong interferes with the general will. In this case, the executive branch's power is not sufficiently dependent on the legislative branch. By distributing authority across multiple magistrates, the problem is ameliorated. The opposite problem, a government that is too weak, results in anarchy. To avoid this, Rousseau proposes the establishment of special courts "to concentrate" strength in terms of enforcing order.

### Book 3, Chapter 8: That All Forms of Government Do Not Suit All Countries

In Chapter 8 Rousseau returns to the topic of liberty. As with his discussions of the organization of the state and its government, Rousseau acknowledges that conditions influence a society's liberty. Citing Montesquieu, Rousseau claims liberty is not "a fruit of all climates."

More specifically, land "where the surplus of product over labor is only middling [is] suitable for free peoples." This is because fertile soil not only produces luxury, which erodes virtue, but also, by producing more food than needed, tempts a monarch to confiscate it. Consequently, a resource-rich territory is more suitable to a monarchy than another form of government. "Unfriendly and barren lands," on the other hand, should be populated by "savages." That is because civilization is impossible among this class of people.

### Book 3, Chapter 9: The Marks of a Good Government

While Rousseau maintains there is no such thing as "the best government," there are myriad workable arrangements. He does think there is such a thing as a good government. People disagree on what constitutes such, because "moral qualities do not admit of exact measurement." Nevertheless, the point of society is "the preservation and prosperity of its members." Consequently, "the government under which without external aids ... the citizens increase and multiply most, is beyond question the best." The maintenance and growth of the population is key to all of society's other goods.

### Book 3, Chapter 10: The Abuse of Government and Its Tendency to Degenerate

The continual tension between the individual and general wills, Rousseau claims, ultimately leads to a government's end. Rousseau identifies two ways in which a government "degenerates." One is its contraction, as "when it passes from the many to the few," be it "from democracy to aristocracy, [or] from aristocracy to royalty." These movements, Rousseau maintains, are natural. The other degeneration of the government occurs when the state itself dissolves.

The state can dissolve, according to Rousseau, in two ways. One is when, in a monarchy, "the prince ceases to administer the State in accordance with the laws," thereby usurping sovereign power. Another state is formed as a result, where a "master and tyrant" rules the people. Here, a monarchy degenerates into a tyranny.

The same situation can occur when several members of the government usurp the laws. Here, the aristocracy degenerates into an oligarchy, whereas a democracy degenerates into mob rule ("ochlocracy"). Common to each is the usurpation of Sovereignty, whereby the people's legislative power is stolen.

### Book 3, Chapter 11: The Death of the Body Politic

Looking back to fallen Greek states, Rousseau declares death as "the natural and inevitable tendency of the best constituted governments." Likening the political to the individual body, Rousseau asserts that "the body politic ... begins to die as soon as it is born, and carries in itself the causes of its destruction."

Continuing the analogy, Rousseau writes that the "life principle" of the body politic is found in the authority of the sovereign's "legislative power." This, he maintains, is the state's heart, while the executive branch, as the brain, "causes the movement of all the parts." Like in a human body, the brain may cease to function normally, but the rest of the body can live on. If the heart stops beating, however, "the animal is dead."

The state, Rousseau reminds his reader, is not sustained by laws but by legislation. Laws change, depending on the general will, but "legislative power" is not. Old laws that persist do so because the people, the legislative body, the Sovereign, continue to respect them. There is "tacit consent" to them.

## Analysis

[Jean-Jacques Rousseau](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/author/) has previously asserted the basic idea that a one-size-fits-all societal structure is doomed to fail. Various factors, from geography to climate to population, have to be considered in determining what sort of government to adopt. It is interesting that Rousseau focuses on climate and geography as conducive to certain forms of government, rather than impose a form. In this, he seems to anticipate Marx's view that economic relations are derived from the conditions on the ground.

Marx's theory could be said to have some basis at a time when economic and social structures had such a firmly agricultural base as they did in the 18th century, when Rousseau was writing. Of course, a nation that produced cotton would differ in nature and outlook from a nation that produced meat or cheese. However, the extension of his ideas to such concepts as racial attitudes embedded in coastal people or people of warm versus cold blood smacks of racism and becomes much less relevant as societies transform from agricultural to industrial and then from industrial to information and service-based economies.

It is also worth noting Rousseau's emphasis on population growth as the mark of a good government. He appears to have in mind the idea that a robust population will be best able to care for the basic needs to the society, thereby supporting a stable government. These types of arguments show how Enlightenment thinkers relied on rational thought to develop their ideas.

# Book 3, Chapters 12–18 | Summary

## Summary

### Book 3, Chapter 12: How the Sovereign Authority Maintains Itself

The Sovereign's power or force is nothing but "the legislative power, [so that it] acts only by means of the laws." Consequently, "the Sovereign cannot act save when the people is assembled." [Rousseau](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/author/) points to the Roman practice of assembling regularly, despite a "vast population." He looks even further back in history, in which he finds "most ancient governments, even those of monarchical form ... had similar councils." He concludes the brief chapter by asserting that this evidence (that is, what actually was the case) means that it is possible in contemporary states.

### Book 3, Chapter 13: The Same (continued)

Not only is regular assembly a crucial component of a state's continued existence but also "fixed periodical assemblies" attended without summons. While Rousseau does not prescribe a calendar for such assemblies, he does suggest that frequent assemblies correspond to a strong government. In addition, nothing should interfere with them, and if something does, the state is damaged.

### Book 3, Chapter 14: The Same (continued)

Rousseau concludes the three chapters on maintaining sovereign authority with Chapter 14. In it he focuses on its vulnerabilities. The power of the assembled people is such that "the executive power is [thereby] suspended, and the person of the meanest citizen is as sacred and inviolable" as that of the highest official.

While it is the government's (i.e., the executive branch's) role to serve the general will, when that will is exercised, the government's purpose is suspended. The government responds, Rousseau points out, with some anxiety. It is, after all, a "curb on the government," which is interested in preserving its own power. A state's downfall is heralded by a "greedy, cowardly, and pusillanimous" citizenry that, over time, gives in to the promises of an equally greedy ruler. They abdicate their freedom for temporary luxury.

### Book 3, Chapter 15: Deputies or Representatives

"As soon as public service ceases to be the chief business of the citizens," preferring to pay someone else to do their civic duties, "the State is not far from its fall." According to Rousseau, "idleness and money," in the form of a representative government, render citizens apathetic, so that the general will is never realized.

Rousseau argues, based on his previous relevant concepts, that "Sovereignty, for the same reason as makes it inalienable, cannot be represented." Sovereignty cannot be transferred, as would be the case if one pays someone to represent them.

The origin of representative government, Rousseau argues, is the feudal system. It, Rousseau claims, is "that iniquitous and absurd system which degrades humanity and dishonors the name of man." While it may have been the case in ancient Greece and Rome that slavery afforded citizens the time required to participate in politics, representative government, Rousseau contends, creates a version of slavery all its own. Given that the purpose of legislation is to declare the general will, any version of representation delegitimizes the state.

### Book 3, Chapter 16: That the Institution of Government Is Not a Contract

Rousseau claims that there is no contract between the people and the government, or executive branch. No contract exists between citizens and magistrates, for such would be a surrendering of their freedom. Because inequality exists between magistrates and citizens, no contract, which implies obligations, can be entered into. Instead, contracts are made between equals; as Rousseau points out, "There is only one contract in the State, and that is the act of association."

### Book 3, Chapter 17: The Institution of Government

Rousseau was clear in Chapter 16 that the government is not contracted—it is not an agreement between Sovereign and magistrates. Instead, Sovereign law institutes the governing body; the people nominate the magistrates. "This nomination, being a particular act, is clearly ... a consequence of the first and a function of government"—not a second law.

The order of operations is clear. No government exists prior to its legislation by the Sovereign, that is, the general will. The form of government (e.g., an aristocracy) is legislated. Once constituted, the government must be populated accordingly. This, then, becomes the second step. Though the Sovereign only legislates and the nomination of magistrates is a particular act (because at this moment the instituting of the government is incomplete), the people act, however briefly, as a democracy.

### Book 3, Chapter 18: How to Check the Usurpations of Government

Rousseau completes his thread on the institution of governments in Chapter 18 with a summary of what has been argued thus far. Because the government is not equivalent to the state, there is no contracting with it. Instead, the government is an institution of law. Those executives of the government "are not the people's masters" but instead are their "officers." The government is to obey the general will, which can alter or dismantle that government "when it likes." Finally, when one serves in the capacity of an executive, one thereby fulfills one's duty as a citizen.

He also argues that the government should not be modified "except when it comes to be incompatible with the public good." Though the government—class rule by aristocracy, for example—is "provisional" and as such subject to change, any adjustment is "dangerous," as it is disruptive to the common good.

Rousseau concludes Book 3 with two prescriptions for all assemblies. These reflect the importance of the general will, which is not bound by any external force to continue in its present form. First, "does it please the Sovereign to preserve the present form of government?" Second, "does it please the people to leave its administration in the hands of those who are actually in charge of it?"

## Analysis

As [Jean-Jacques Rousseau](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/author/) has already pointed out, the Sovereign and government are in continual tension. What he focuses on in Chapters 12 through 14 are, respectively, the state's assembly, the regularity of that assembly, and the state's vulnerabilities. The general will is the body politic or Sovereign, and is articulated in law. The practicalities of that articulation—how the Sovereign's voice is heard—are explained by assemblies. All citizens must convene to discuss, debate, and legislate. Rousseau also emphasizes the importance of regular assemblies to protecting the Sovereign's authority. Without them the government can exert its will without impediment. For Rousseau, then, the duties of citizenship are essential to the survival of the body politic. For that reason they cannot be transferred.

Chapters 16 and 17 focus, respectively, on what the government is not, and what it is. The government is not a contract between political authority and citizens. It is, rather, instituted by the Sovereign decree. The people, by law, decree a form of government, and they "nominate the rulers who are to be entrusted with the government that has been established."

# Book 4, Chapters 1–3 | Summary

## Summary

### Book 4, Chapter 1: That the General Will is Indestructible

The general will, [Jean-Jacques Rousseau](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/author/) claims, is indestructible. It may be subverted, silenced, or sold, but it cannot be destroyed. Promoting and protecting it is the supreme civic duty. Rousseau takes up this topic in the remaining chapters in his final book.

He declares that the "upright and simple" individual facilitates the general will, because this morally acute person is difficult to deceive. In addition, the management of the Sovereign is essential to the health and well-being of the general will.

### Book 4, Chapter 2: Voting

Rousseau maintains the voting right is an inalienable right of every citizen. It is through voting that the general will is exercised and actualized through legislation. This is most efficiently accomplished through unanimous agreement. "The more concert reigns in the assemblies ... the greater is the dominance of the general will."

Such unanimity is, in practice, almost impossible to achieve. Moreover, it is not even desirable. To the extent that unanimity can be achieved by corrupt means, it does not reflect the general will. It is, consequently, not a requirement for legislation. It is, however, a requirement for the social contract. Everyone who enters into a civil society must do so freely.

The majority of votes wins the day. Rousseau recognizes a potential problem with this approach to voting: "But it is asked how a man can be both free and forced to conform to wills that are not his own." His solution is to return to the conceptual starting point of the social contract, namely the agreement to "consent to all the laws, including those which are passed in spite of his opposition." Moreover, each citizen is to vote in accordance to the general will. Consequently, Rousseau takes a minority vote to be an error: "I was mistaken, and that what I thought to be the general will was not so."

### Book 4, Chapter 3:Elections

Rousseau moves on in Chapter 3 to consider elections. Elections by choice or vote are best suited to an aristocracy, while elections by lot are more suited to a democracy. Because the government's role is to implement the general will through its laws, it is important that those elected serve the common good. In a democracy, such service is considered a burden—no one's special interests are served, power is not exploited—which is the reason for election by lot.

Rousseau thinks most governments will be a mixture of election by choice and by lot. Consequently, because the offices to be filled should be elected on the basis of specific skills (such as military service), election by choice is appropriate. Where an office requires merely "good sense, justice, and integrity," election by lot is preferred. In a monarchical government, neither approach "has any place."

## Analysis

The general will can be abandoned but never destroyed. That is because, according to [Jean-Jacques Rousseau](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/author/), it is that alone which aims at the common good. The exercise of that will occurs by voting. Here again, the imperative of each citizen to participate as a member of the Sovereign is highlighted. While the individual will may not coincide with the general will, it is the latter that wins the vote. Insofar as the individual citizen has already agreed to promote the common good through the general will, that individual still "wins," even if he voted otherwise.

The reader can imagine someone who, for example, has a financial interest in a company that engages in poor environmental practices. Perhaps they pollute the water or air during the process of manufacturing their product. That individual's interest conflicts with the common good of clean water or air. At the same time, clean water or air is also good for the individual. If that citizen votes against the common good, they also vote against their own, more fundamental interest. Consequently, if the general will is, in this example, to create environmental protection laws, the good of all is promoted.

# Book 4, Chapters 4–9 | Summary

## Summary

### Book 4, Chapter 4: The Roman Comitia

The first of five chapters devoted to the Roman Republic begins with an analysis of the comitia, an institution [Jean-Jacques Rousseau](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/author/) takes to contribute to the maintenance of the general will. After reviewing the basic makeup of the republic, Rousseau discusses the comitia, or lawfully assembled divisions of the people for the purpose of organized lawmaking.

When the assemblies, or comitia, were "lawfully summoned," three conditions had to exist in order "for their acts to have the force of law": First, the one who convened the assembly had to have the requisite authority. Second, the assembly occurred "on a day allowed by law; and [third] the auguries had to be favorable."

Three comitia—the Curiae, the Centuriate, and the Tribal—each had their drawbacks and benefits. Romulus founded the Curiae as a check on the Senate and people, and he maintained power over both. According to Rousseau, it failed because it did not include all citizens from the various classes of people. The Centuriate, favored by aristocrats, represented all the classes. The wealthiest, however, had the majority vote. Last, the Tribal Comitia inverted the flaw of the Centuriate. It excluded the aristocrats. Of them, Rousseau claims, the Centuriate came closest to aiming to advance the general will.

In the Roman Republic, voting was a matter of verbal declaration, which was noted by the clerk. The majority vote won. "This custom was good as long as honesty was triumphant among the citizens," and no one voted for an unjust law. Because of corruption, however, secret voting became the standard.

### Book 4, Chapter 5: The Tribunate

The tribunate is "the defender of the laws." Rousseau states that its role in the Roman Republic was "to protect the Sovereign against the government," while its role as The Council of Ten in Venice was "to uphold the government against the people." In Sparta, the Ephors' role was to strike a balance between the two.

Rousseau declares the tribunate to be "the strongest support a good constitution can have." Its strength, however, cannot be "excessive," for then it "upsets the whole State." Nor can it be weak, for that is unnatural: weakness defeats its reason for being. For Rousseau, the veto power of the tribunate is key to its protection of the general will.

### Book 4, Chapter 6: The Dictatorship

In the Roman Republic the dictator was an office institutionalized by constitution. It was active only during times of crisis and for six months—or longer, depending on the length of the crisis. The dictatorial power was virtually absolute.

Rousseau thinks a dictatorship is justified under only the most extreme circumstances, namely when the state's very existence "is at stake." These circumstances should be rare, and when they do occur, there must exist a provision, for the sake of public security, that entrusts the state to one who is "most worthy." In order to save the state, in other words, a dictator may be required. His sole role is to ensure that the state survives the crisis, and to this extent his actions are aligned with the general will.

### Book 4, Chapter 7: The Censorship

"As the law is the declaration of the general will, the censorship is the declaration of the public judgment." Maintenance of the general will requires a virtuous citizenry, and a censor serves as the spokesman for public morality. The Court of Honor's role, consequently, is to maintain public virtue. More specifically, Rousseau thinks the regulation of judgment is conducive to the common good. The censor himself must be reputed as honorable. Here again, Rousseau derives the office from the Roman Republic.

### Book 4, Chapter 8: Civil Religion

Religion was initially the foundation of society. After all, people are much more willing to be ruled by gods than other people. Moreover, Rousseau continues, there were multiple gods for multiple city-states. Political wars, Rousseau maintains, were effectively religious wars. What the Romans did when they conquered a territory was to incorporate the vanquished gods into the Roman pantheon, paganism.

The Catholic Church, Rousseau argues, clearly distinguished its theology from politics. When it gained immense power, Europe was left divided between religious and political authority. While Rousseau commends [Thomas Hobbes](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/key-figure-analysis/#Thomas_Hobbes) for a strategy to reunite them, he thinks it is a mistake to believe such a reunification can be accomplished for this religion.

Rousseau proceeds to outline three ways to practice religion. The first he calls "the religion of man," and the second, the religion of the citizen. The third critiques for causing a duality in people's lives, demanding that they be loyal to two sets of laws, two rulers, and two countries, rendering "them subject to contradictory duties, and [making] it impossible for them to be faithful both to religion and to citizenship." This, he declares, is Catholicism. He doesn't much care for the second religion, either; it is a recipe for tyranny and imperialism. It is the first religion, the true Gospel, that Rousseau initially proposes as fitting for a civil state, for it reflects the values of the social contract. "Every one would do his duty"; at every level of society, people would be free from criminality, excess, corruption, cowardice, and vanity.

A Christian state is not, however, without its flaws. For example, Christians are not concerned with their earthly existence. Consequently, they would be susceptible to abuses of power. Moreover, Christians do not make for good soldiers; "they have no passion for victory; they know better how to die than how to conquer."

Having rejected Christianity as the religious basis for a civil society, Rousseau proposes a civil religion: "a purely civil profession of faith," whose creed ("social sentiments" rather than dogmas) is defined by the general will and aimed at helping individuals become good citizens.

### Book 4, Chapter 9: Conclusion

Rousseau concludes _The Social Contract_ with ideas to consider in support of his present work. These include international law and relations, economics, and war. These topics, however, extend beyond the scope of the current treatise.

## Analysis

[Rousseau](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/author/) shows his appreciation for the Roman Republic in the final chapters of _The Social Contract_ by reviewing, at times in detail, features of its organization he wishes to adopt in his political theory. These include the comitia, occasional tribunate, dictatorship, and public censor. The comitia, or assembly, is the gathering of citizens to debate and vote on legislation. It serves to check governmental encroachment into the Sovereign, and vice versa. A dictatorship may be required to save the state in dire circumstances but is not an indefinitely held office. Last, public morality is preserved and promoted through censorship.

Rousseau's discussion of religion in this last book is commonly viewed as the section that provoked authorities in Paris to ban _The Social Contract_. He argues that a civil religion is appropriate to a civil society. This religion is the one most in keeping with the features of the Sovereign already discussed. More specifically, it reflects the idea that the Sovereign's power is limited to public interests. How people worship (or not) is private. Publicly, however, the citizens must pledge allegiance to certain ideas: that God exists, that there is an afterlife, that one will promote universal justice, that one respects the "sanctity" of the social contract, and that one will reject intolerance. These pledges, according to Rousseau, promote public virtue and a stable state.

[Jean-Jacques Rousseau](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/key-figures/#Jean-Jacques_Rousseau), [Book 1, Chapter 1](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/book-1-chapters-1-6-summary/)

This is Jean-Jacques Rousseau's aphoristic opening sentence and fundamental criticism of modern society, which restricts human freedom and creates inequality.

> The strongest is never strong enough to be always the master, unless he transforms that strength into right. 

[Jean-Jacques Rousseau](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/key-figures/#Jean-Jacques_Rousseau), [Book 1, Chapter 3](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/book-1-chapters-1-6-summary/)

A society founded on tyranny is a society doomed to fail. Following Plato, Jean-Jacques Rousseau argues against the view that might makes right. Instead, a legitimate society is one into which free people freely enter. He seems not to notice that his theory sanctions revolution, because if free people freely enter a legitimate society, they may also freely leave it.

For Jean-Jacques Rousseau, freedom, or liberty, is fundamental to what it is to be human. This liberty generally means freedom from external coercion.

The body politic, or Sovereign, consists of every citizen. Insofar as entering into this body creates a single individual, the interests of particular individuals are outweighed by the common interest, which is the common good.

5.

[Jean-Jacques Rousseau](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/key-figures/#Jean-Jacques_Rousseau), [Book 1, Chapter 7](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/book-1-chapters-7-9-summary/)

For Jean-Jacques Rousseau no legitimate civil society exists without the Sovereign, as he conceives it. Each citizen has equal value; each citizen's voice is as strong as every other.

6.

> Each member of the community gives himself to it, at the moment of its foundation. 

[Jean-Jacques Rousseau](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/key-figures/#Jean-Jacques_Rousseau), [Book 1, Chapter 9](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/book-1-chapters-7-9-summary/)

Jean-Jacques Rousseau is aware that people have different resources, goods, talents, skills, and so forth. Human beings are not equal in this sense. But all human beings are equally committed to the societies in which they live, whether they like it or not.

[Jean-Jacques Rousseau](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/key-figures/#Jean-Jacques_Rousseau), [Book 2, Chapter 1](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/book-2-chapters-1-6-summary/)

For Jean-Jacques Rousseau the survival of the Sovereign is the only guarantor of liberty, yet it will survive only if the people guard their liberty, not ceding it over to someone to rule over them. This would be relinquishing their freedom and thus the Sovereign would cease to exist.

8.

> There is often a great deal of difference between the will of all and the general will. 

[Jean-Jacques Rousseau](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/key-figures/#Jean-Jacques_Rousseau), [Book 2, Chapter 3](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/book-2-chapters-1-6-summary/)

Jean-Jacques Rousseau understands that individuals have particular interests. The sum of these interests is not, however, the general will. That's because some interests are competing or outright contradictory. The general will, on the other hand, reflects the shared interest of the citizens. He takes this to be the common good.

9.

> When the whole people decrees for the whole people, it is considering only itself. 

[Jean-Jacques Rousseau](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/key-figures/#Jean-Jacques_Rousseau), [Book 2, Chapter 6](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/book-2-chapters-1-6-summary/)

The Sovereign articulates the general will through legislating. This is not a conglomeration of the individuals but the will of the people as a unified entity. For Jean-Jacques Rousseau, laws by definitions are expressions of the general will.

10.

> [In the State] force and will are distinguished: will [is] legislative power and force [is] executive power. 

[Jean-Jacques Rousseau](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/key-figures/#Jean-Jacques_Rousseau), [Book 3, Chapter 1](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/book-3-chapters-1-6-summary/)

Jean-Jacques Rousseau distinguishes the Sovereign from the government by an analogy to an individual: a person wills something and their body acts on it, or implements that will. Similarly, the Sovereign is the general will, and the government acts on it or implements law.

11.

> [Government is] an intermediate body set up between the subjects and the Sovereign, to secure their mutual correspondence. 

[Jean-Jacques Rousseau](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/key-figures/#Jean-Jacques_Rousseau), [Book 3, Chapter 1](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/book-3-chapters-1-6-summary/)

Here, Jean-Jacques Rousseau offers a basic definition of the government. It is the branch of the state that executes or carries out the laws and the daily administration of the state, guaranteeing liberty for all citizens.

12.

> The Sovereign, having no force other than the legislative power, acts only by means of the laws. 

[Jean-Jacques Rousseau](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/key-figures/#Jean-Jacques_Rousseau), [Book 3, Chapter 12](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/book-3-chapters-12-18-summary/)

Jean-Jacques Rousseau highlights the nature and function of the Sovereign by how its voice is articulated, and how its voice is heard. The general will is articulated in law, and the citizens assemble to debate and create that law. When, he cautions, the citizenry is assembled, the Sovereign has no power.

13.

> The moment the people is legitimately assembled as a sovereign body, the jurisdiction of the government wholly lapses. 

[Jean-Jacques Rousseau](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/key-figures/#Jean-Jacques_Rousseau), [Book 3, Chapter 14](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/book-3-chapters-12-18-summary/)

The authority of the state rests in the Sovereign. Jean-Jacques Rousseau highlights this point by examining what happens when the citizens assemble. More specifically, when the citizens assemble to debate and legislate, the government ceases to exist—there is, effectively, no law to administer.

14.

> [When citizens] would rather serve with their money than with their persons, the State is not far from its fall. 

[Jean-Jacques Rousseau](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/key-figures/#Jean-Jacques_Rousseau), [Book 3, Chapter 15](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/book-3-chapters-12-18-summary/)

Jean-Jacques Rousseau is adamant that each citizen's duty is to participate in political life. This duty cannot be transferred or otherwise abnegated without "killing" the body politic, the Sovereign.

15.

> [In the] purely civil profession of faith ... the Sovereign should fix the articles ... as social sentiments. 

[Jean-Jacques Rousseau](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/key-figures/#Jean-Jacques_Rousseau), [Book 4, Chapter 8](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Social-Contract/book-4-chapters-4-9-summary/)

Jean-Jacques Rousseau's book met with deep criticism from both religious and nonreligious circles. It was banned in Paris largely on the basis of the chapter on religion. Rousseau effectively rejects the idea that a particular religion should be associated with the state. Instead, there should be belief in divinity, for example, but not a divinity that is particularly identified. And the "religion" should help people be better citizens.

# Biography

### Early Years

Born June 28, 1712, in Geneva, Switzerland, Jean-Jacques Rousseau became an immensely influential thinker in art, religion, and political philosophy. His mother, Suzanne Bernard, died shortly after his birth, leaving his father, Isaac Rousseau, to raise him. A watchmaker, Rousseau's father elevated his social status through marriage but eventually had to escape Geneva when he became embroiled in a dispute.

Prior to his departure, Isaac Rousseau had instilled into the young Rousseau a love of Geneva, where he, as a citizen, had voting rights. He also cultivated a love of reading, which, in turn, inspired intense romantic ideas about life.

Rousseau was left in Geneva with an uncle and later sent away to school. At 13 he was apprenticed to a notary and then an engraver, the latter of whom beat him. Having run away at 15, he eventually came under the protection of a noblewoman, the Baroness of Warens. A convert to Catholicism, Warens was instrumental in Rousseau's conversion, which resulted in his relinquishing his Genevan citizenship.

Rousseau's relationship with the baroness, who was separated from her husband, was complicated. He lived with her at various points, eventually becoming her lover when he turned 20. She often supported him financially and also provided for his religious and music education. In addition, having surrounded herself with the educated Catholic elite, she introduced him to the world of ideas.

Eventually, Rousseau began studying in earnest—mathematics, music, and philosophy, especially—and in his late 20s became a tutor in Lyon. After having developed a new system of musical notation, Rousseau moved to Paris in 1742 to present it to the Académie des Sciences. Though they rejected it as impractical, the Académie acknowledged Rousseau's mastery of the subject matter and encouraged him to continue working on it.

During a brief posting as secretary to the French ambassador to Venice, Rousseau developed a love of Italian opera. He would later write a popular opera, _The Village Soothsayer_, which was performed in 1752 for King Louis XV. Delighted with the work, the king offered Rousseau a lifelong pension, which he declined. Such decisions would become almost commonplace, rooted as they were in Rousseau's political views.

An essay entitled _Discourse on the Arts and Sciences_, which won first prize in an essay contest in 1750, established Rousseau's reputation. In it he argued that humans, who are basically good by nature, are corrupted by the arts and sciences. The basic thesis about human goodness became the foundation of his later political works.

During his time in Paris, Rousseau also became a friend of French philosopher Denis Diderot, whose _Encyclopédie_ (1772) he copublished with French mathematician and philosopher Jean Le Rond d'Alembert. These philosophers were at the center of French intellectual life. United by the commitment to rationality, the French intellectuals wrote on an array of topics. Rousseau contributed music articles, as well as an important essay on political economy, which was published in 1755. The _Encyclopédie_ became the repository of French Enlightenment achievements.

Rousseau's personal life continued to be complicated. He became involved with a seamstress, Thérèse Levasseur, and he had at least one child with her. He persuaded Levasseur to give the infant up to an orphanage. Eventually, he took her and her mother in as servants, supporting them and the rest of their family.

### Period of Intense and Prolific Writing

Rousseau returned to Geneva in 1754, reconverted to Calvinism (branch of Protestantism), and regained his citizenship. He also became embroiled in a controversy that resulted in a falling out with Diderot and the _Encyclopédistes_. Rousseau's romantic spiritualism, for example, contrasted starkly with Diderot's atheism. This did not, however, prove to be an obstacle to a prodigious output: _Discourse on the Origin of Inequality_ (1755); _Discourse on Political Economy_ (published in the fifth volume of the _Encyclopédie_, 1755); _Letter to d'Alembert_ (1758); _Julie, or The_ _New Heloise_ (1761); __É___mile_ or _On Education or_ _Émile_ (1762); _The Social Contract_ (1762); _Dictionary of Music_ (1768); _Confessions_ (1782); _Rousseau, Judge of Jean-Jacques_ (1780); and _Reveries of a Solitary Walker_ (1782).

The novels _Julie_ and _Émile_ were, respectively, popular and infamous. The former influenced romanticism, and the latter, education. In _Émile_ Rousseau included a defense of religious belief; because it rejected original sin and divine revelation, both Protestant and Catholic authorities took offense. His books, and Rousseau himself, were banned in France and Geneva.

With arrest warrants out, Rousseau fled. He received various invitations, including one from French writer Voltaire, and eventually, with protection from Frederick the Great of Prussia, landed in a principality ruled by Frederick. There, however, he was hounded by religious critics and eventually left. He spent a brief time on a small island in Switzerland before he was instructed to leave.

Arriving in Paris, Rousseau met the Scottish philosopher, David Hume, with whom he would develop a short-lived friendship. He also reconnected with various friends. Conspicuously absent, however, was Diderot. They were never reconciled, for reasons unknown. Similarly, Rousseau eventually had a falling-out with Hume, who hosted him in Britain during a visit.

### Last Days

Though there was still an arrest warrant out for him in France, Rousseau returned there under an assumed name. He continued writing, studied botany, and variously engaged his many critics. On July 2, 1778, Rousseau died from a stroke.

### Legacy

Rousseau never shied away from complexity. He celebrated nature and solitude but also advocated civil life as essential. He criticized the corrupting power of the arts but also wrote novels and operas. He insisted on the primacy of human freedom but also argued that such freedom is best supported by being forced into interactions with society. He was largely uneducated but was still one of the most successful thinkers of his generation and beyond. He was averse to revolutions but was an inspiration to revolutionaries.

Rousseau's influence is not limited to individual thinkers. Indeed, entire movements and founding documents of new nations can trace significant ideas to him. His _Social Contract_ was an inspiration to the Society of the Jacobins (radical French revolutionaries) and others during the French Revolution (1789–99; a period of social and political upheaval), and his ideas were influential both in American politician Thomas Jefferson's creation of the Declaration of Independence (1776) and in the writing of the Federalist Papers (1788; a series of essays in support of the ratification of the U.S. Constitution).

# 10 Things You Didn't Know

Jean-Jacques Rousseau was one of the most influential—and troubled—philosophers of the 18th century. His most renowned sociopolitical work, _The Social Contract_, had a great impact on modern political thought, and it inspired movements against monarchies that had ruled Europe for centuries. Published in 1762, _The Social Contract_ proposed a model of governance that sought to undo the great inequality between the classes that was so prevalent at the time. Rousseau argued that the people should have a greater say in governance, and that the nobility and monarchs had no true right to their power. Written at a time when monarchy was the prevailing form of government across Europe, _The Social Contract_ quickly became a controversial work, despised by the ruling classes, and leading to many problems for Rousseau himself. Rousseau's mission wasn't in vain, however, as _The Social Contract_ would spark political movements that would alter the power dynamics of European countries in centuries to come.

## 1. _The Social Contract_ was a catalyst for the French Revolution.

Rousseau's work argued against inequality and took a firm stance against monarchy—two ideas that would lead to a [great political upheaval](http://www.historytoday.com/maurice-cranston/french-revolution-ideas-and-ideologies). _The Social Contract_ is often credited as a work that inspired the French Revolution (1789–99), a time of political turmoil, rebellion, and change in France. It was at this time that the monarchy of France was abolished and replaced with a democratic government. Scholars often cite _The Social Contract_ as a treatise that inspired this uprising, although the text itself wasn't read widely in France leading up to the revolution. Rousseau had popularized his thoughts in his more accessible autobiographical _Confessions_ (1782). _The Social Contract_, however, remained an essential work of Rousseau's political philosophy and a blueprint for the revolution of the late 1700s.

## 2. _The Social Contract_ was banned and burned in parts of Europe.

The monarchies of Europe saw _The Social Contract_ as a dangerous document that argued directly against their reigns—and they took steps to ban it as a result. The work was [banned in Paris](https://www.college.columbia.edu/core/content/jean-jacques-rousseau) shortly after publication, and Amsterdam—a city that was famous for being liberal-minded at the time—outlawed the distribution of copies as well. Rousseau was most dismayed, however, when _The Social Contract_ was [burned publicly](https://philosophynow.org/issues/90/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau_1712-1778) in his hometown of Geneva. Genevan authorities even demanded Rousseau's immediate arrest if he ever set foot in the city again. Rousseau had always been proud of the city of his birth, and he stated regretfully, "I took your constitution as my model."

## 3. Rousseau had a rough childhood—and once found himself locked out of the gates of his own hometown.

Rousseau's childhood was bleak, impoverished, and depressing. Born in Geneva—now part of Switzerland, but an independent city-state at the time—in 1712, Rousseau's mother died nine days after his birth. Rousseau's father abandoned him when he was only 10, fleeing Geneva to avoid imprisonment. [The young Rousseau](http://www.notablebiographies.com/Ro-Sc/Rousseau-Jean-Jacques.html) worked a number of tedious jobs to get by, including employment as a notary and as a watchmaker. One day, while returning home to Geneva, Rousseau found the gates of the city locked, barring him from entry. Rousseau left, with almost no money, and eventually made his way to Paris, where he began tutoring and writing.

## 4. Rousseau famously advocated that women breastfeed their children—which may have saved many lives.

Rousseau's treatise on education, _Emile_ (1762), advocated that women breastfeed their children instead of raising them on milk from other animals or using wet nurses. Rousseau brought about [a cultural change](https://books.google.com/books?id=--27CwAAQBAJ&lpg=PA88&dq=rousseau%20breastfeeding&pg=PA88#v=onepage&q&f=false) in European attitudes toward breastfeeding—which some of Rousseau's contemporaries claimed might have saved many lives. Aristocratic women in France, in particular, often opted to hire wet nurses to breastfeed their children, and a common fear was that these women from the "lower classes" would often drink heavily, which can have harmful effects for nursing infants. Whether or not this was really the case, Rousseau's advocacy for breastfeeding was considered a successful public health campaign at the time—although many feminist scholars also take issue with Rousseau's promotion of domesticity and traditional gender roles for women.

## 5. Rousseau was banished, exiled, and labeled the "anti-Christ."

As Rousseau's works, including _The Social Contract_, gained notoriety and faced bans across Europe, the author himself was [exiled](https://www.biographyonline.net/writers/jean-jacques-rousseau.html) from several locales. Once he was threatened with arrest in his native Geneva, he fled to Switzerland (Geneva was a city-state independent of Switzerland at the time), but found himself unwelcome there as well. King Frederick the Great of Prussia—part of modern-day Germany—extended an invitation for Rousseau to seek asylum in his country. Rousseau accepted, but he soon fell out of favor with the local population, particularly the clergy. Pastors denounced Rousseau as the anti-Christ for his theological views, and Rousseau left Prussia as he was pelted with stones by an angry mob. Seemingly defeated, Rousseau took refuge back in Switzerland on a small island, Ile de St Pierre, but even this community would soon force him to leave.

## 6. Rousseau's health declined after a nasty incident with a Great Dane.

In 1776 Rousseau was injured while walking down the street and being knocked to the ground by a gentleman's dog. The dog—a massive Great Dane—trotted along and [smashed into Rousseau](https://books.google.com/books?id=poqbnNBhkDEC&lpg=PA485&dq=rousseau%20death%20great%20dane&pg=PA485#v=onepage&q&f=false), causing him to fall on the street, unconscious and bleeding profusely. Rousseau took a long time to recover from his injury, and one of his friends described the dog as:

>  One of those Great Danes which the vanity of the rich causes to run through the streets in front of their carriages, to the misfortune of people on foot. 

It should be noted that Rousseau, who'd spent his life speaking out against the apathetic, careless ways of the nobility, was likely even further insulted by the fact that a nobleman had so thoughtlessly allowed his dog to harm a pedestrian without even stopping his carriage.

## 7. Rousseau's body was exhumed to dispel rumors of a suicide.

Rousseau died on July 2, 1778, at age 66. Doctors confirmed that the cause of death was a stroke, but this didn't stop the spread of an [unfortunate rumor](https://books.google.com/books?id=6gM7lfHO2UcC&lpg=PA255&dq=rousseau%20rumor%20suicide&pg=PA255#v=onepage&q&f=false) that Rousseau had committed suicide. Rousseau—whose mental health had deteriorated over the years—was said to have shot himself with a pistol, although his lover, Thérèse Levasseur, adamantly denied that this had been the case. The rumor was so persistent, however, that authorities finally decided to dispel it more than a century later in 1897 when Rousseau's body was exhumed and the skeleton examined. Clearly, no sign of a gunshot wound was found.

## 8. Rousseau's nemesis, the French philosopher Voltaire, criticized _The Social Contract_—but lamented that it was burned.

Rousseau's intellectual adversary was the French writer and philosopher Voltaire. The two bickered through letters throughout their lives, and Voltaire once read a copy of _The Social Contract_, writing his [numerous arguments](http://expositions.nlr.ru/eng/ex_rare/Voltaire_Rousseau/dogovor.php) against Rousseau's political thought in the margins. However, when Voltaire learned that _The Social Contract_ had been burned publicly in Geneva, he was outraged on Rousseau's behalf. Objecting to the very concept of book-burning, [Voltaire wrote that](https://books.google.com/books?id=9lWNCwAAQBAJ&pg=PR14-IA101&lpg=PR14-IA101&dq=%22We+do+not+have+enough+wit+to+reply+to+it.%22&source=bl&ots=9md3bwaY0C&sig=KcvIWJyncgcN8HQ8nYfFRvkjrpY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiGgsiM4Z_XAhWG7yYKHYZ4DjwQ6AEIMDAC#v=onepage&q=%22We%20do%20not%20have%20enough%20wit%20to%20reply%20to%20it.%22&f=false):

>  The operation of burning it was just as odious as that of writing it. There are some things that a wise government must ignore. To burn a book of argument is to say: "We do not have enough wit to reply to it." 

## 9. Scottish philosopher David Hume convinced Rousseau to move to England for his own protection.

After being kicked out of numerous European cities, Rousseau was in desperate need of asylum in 1765. He finally [accepted an invitation](https://books.google.com/books?id=7HXJAqqNl4QC&lpg=PA507&dq=rousseau%20david%20hume%20invitation&pg=PA507#v=onepage&q&f=false) he had previously refused—the chance to find refuge in London with Scottish philosopher David Hume. Hume was a fan of Rousseau's controversial political works, and he had a deep respect for the man. Rousseau, however, hated both the climate of England and philosophers in general, so their friendship was rather short-lived. By 1766 Rousseau was convinced that Hume was [plotting against him](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/apr/29/philosophy) and withholding his correspondence from friends in other parts of Europe. Rousseau accused Hume, claiming:

>  You have badly concealed yourself. I understand you, Sir, and you well know it ... You brought me to England, apparently to procure a refuge for me, and in reality to dishonor me. You applied yourself to this noble endeavor with a zeal worthy of your heart and with an art worthy of your talents. 

Hume was befuddled by this accusation, and he was offended that Rousseau could be so ungrateful after all the trouble he'd gone to in securing him a home in England. After their final exchange of words, Hume condemned "the monstrous ingratitude, ferocity, and frenzy of the man."

## 10. Rousseau suffered from paranoia.

A life of exile, threats of arrest, and a family whom he never truly knew left Rousseau psychologically scarred. Many contemporary psychoanalysts believe Rousseau exhibited [signs of paranoia](https://philosophynow.org/issues/68/The_Full_Revelation_of_the_Self_Jean-Jacques_Rousseau_and_the_Birth_of_Deep_Autobiography) during his later years. Rousseau's quarrel with David Hume is a clear example of this, as he was so convinced that Hume was plotting against him, he wouldn't listen to reason. Scholars attribute Rousseau's paranoia to his many years living as a refugee in various parts of Europe, as well as the constant persecution he faced from governments for his political writings such as _The Social Contract._
