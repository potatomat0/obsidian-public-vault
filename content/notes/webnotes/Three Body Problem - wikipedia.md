_____
In [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") and [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics"), the **three-body problem** is the problem of taking the initial positions and velocities (or [momenta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum "Momentum")) of three point masses and solving for their subsequent motion according to [Newton's laws of motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion "Newton's laws of motion") and [Newton's law of universal gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation "Newton's law of universal gravitation"). The three-body problem is a special case of the [n-body problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-body_problem "N-body problem"). Unlike [two-body problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-body_problem "Two-body problem"), no general [closed-form solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-form_solution "Closed-form solution") exists, as the resulting [dynamical system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system "Dynamical system") is [chaotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory "Chaos theory") for most [initial conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_condition "Initial condition"), and [numerical methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_method "Numerical method") are generally required.

Historically, the first specific three-body problem to receive extended study was the one involving the [Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon "Moon"), [Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth "Earth"), and the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun "Sun"). In an extended modern sense, a three-body problem is any problem in [classical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics "Classical mechanics") or [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics") that models the motion of three particles
