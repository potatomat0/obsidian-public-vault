_____
**Anthropomorphism** is the attribution of human traits, emotions, or intentions to non-human entities. It is considered to be an innate tendency of human psychology. [Personification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personification "Personification") is the related attribution of human form and characteristics to abstract concepts such as nations, emotions, and natural forces, such as seasons and weather. Both have ancient roots as storytelling and artistic devices, and most cultures have traditional fables with anthropomorphized animals as characters. People have also routinely attributed human emotions and behavioral traits to wild as well as domesticated animals.
