- Also, an interesting article by **nicky case** about memory and learning i played 2 years ago:  [How To Remember Anything Forever-ish](https://ncase.me/remember/)

- There is also this reddit summary on the **learning how to learn course** on coursera, which is kinda similar to what this note is about: [[Coursera - Learning how to learn summary]]

## ADDRESSING SOME LEARNER'S ILLUSION OF KNOWLEDGE 

- just because you spend a lot of time with some topic or material doesnt mean you actually know it, there's a huge difference between feeling that you know something, with truly understanding something 
- Seeing information infront you of, doesnt mean that you know it 
- Seeing or hearing someone's conclusions, doesnt mean that you know and understand the arguments and logic that lead to that conclusion 
- Searching for something on google gives you the illusion that the information is in your brain 


## 1. DIFFUSED AND FOCUSED MODES

**Diffused mode** happens when your brain is relaxed and not thinking of anything in particular. **Creative** **ways** of **linking** a different set of **ideas** usually happen when you are in this particular mode, such as going for a long walk or taking a nap. On the other hand, when you are in **focused mod**e it means you are **paying close attention** to a specific problem, such as solving a maths problem or solving a puzzle. A **constant flow** between these two modes is desired and recommended, since it **allows** our **brain** to **address a problem** from **two very different perspectives** without us noticing. Didn’t it ever happen to you that you found the solution to a problem while on the bus? Well, there you go!

## 2. THE POMODORO TECHNIQUE

Back in the 80s, Francesco Cirillo came up with this awesome idea, the **[pomodoro technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnt2lTdcn8g)**! How does it work?

1. You **shut off** all **distractions** (mobile phone on airplane mode, closing all unrelated tabs in your browser, music and TV… everything!),
    
2. find your **favorite place** to study/work,
    
3. set a **timer** for **25 minutes**,
    
4. **focus** on the task as much as you can during this time,
    
5. and once you are done, you **reward yourself** with a 5 minutes break.

## 3. Active recalling 

Once we have dealt with something new we are trying to learn, carrying out active recall is very desired to force our brain to retrieve the ideas from memory.

Say you are learning a new language, and you just studied a new set of words and verbs: instead of passively reading and re-reading the words and their meaning over and over again, try to come up with their meaning by recalling it. The effect is amazing!

According to neuroscience, if we use active recall periodically we are setting up stronger brain-links (that is, connections between ideas) that will last longer. It’s like establishing a clearer path for your brain to travel when this concepts arise in the future.

## 4. The memory palace technique 

Using the example of [Nelson Dellis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Dellis), four times US Memory Champion, the authors explain what **tricks** can be used in order to **improve our memory** and make it more **sticky**:

- **Focus** as much as you can on what you want to remember
    
- **Practice**, a lot!
    
- **Turn your thoughts into a picture**. The more interactions you add to the picture, the easier it will be to remember
    
- **Metaphors** help to remember concepts dramatically
    
- **Use active recall** to make the concepts and ideas stick

## 5. HEALTHY HABITS

- **Sleep**. The _hippocampus_ is the part of the brain that help us remember facts and events. While we **sleep**, information gathered in the neurons of our hippocampus is transferred into the neurons of our _cerebral cortex_, making more room for new learning.
    

- **Food**. [Research](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/your-brain-on-chocolate-2017081612179) shows that most of the veggies, nuts and even dark chocolate, are the best stuff you can feed your body with, and also your brain!
    
- **Exercise**. By exercising, we produce chemicals (such as serotonin and dopamine) that help our brain come up with new ideas. These chemicals help on linking old ideas with new ones, letting us think in news ways.

## 6. Learning completely different 

Authors encourage us, the readers, to learn something quite different to what we are passionate about, stating that we can become even better at our passion by doing so because of the flexibility this would give us.

**Transfer learning** actually comes from this idea: we find different, more creative ways to approach a specific problem by applying knowledge of a different topic at the time to solve it. So, basically we are re-using brain-links of one area to more easily build links in a completely different area.

## Bonus: some of my personal techniques 

- Write notes systematically and spend some time in your day reviewing them 
- USE OBSIDIAN or any note taking system that can backlink
