When Karl Marx said that conflict is the driving force of history, he meant that the way societies change is through the conflict between different social classes. He argued that the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles.

Marx believed that there are two main classes in society: the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. The bourgeoisie are the owners of the means of production, while the proletariat are the workers who sell their labor power to the bourgeoisie. Marx argued that the bourgeoisie exploit the proletariat by paying them less than the value of their labor. This surplus value is then used to accumulate capital, which further enriches the bourgeoisie and impoverishes the proletariat.

Marx believed that this conflict between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat would eventually lead to revolution. The proletariat would overthrow the bourgeoisie and establish a communist society, in which there would be no classes and no exploitation.

Marx's theory of class conflict has been influential in many areas of thought, including sociology, political science, and economics. It has also been used to justify revolutions and other forms of social change.

However, Marx's theory has also been criticized. Some people argue that it is too simplistic, and that it does not take into account the complexity of social relations. Others argue that it is outdated, and that it does not apply to the modern world.

Despite these criticisms, Marx's theory of class conflict remains an important contribution to social thought. It provides a framework for understanding the dynamics of social change, and it continues to be used by scholars and activists around the world.
