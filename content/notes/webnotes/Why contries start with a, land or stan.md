The suffix **-ia** is a Latin ending used to form abstract nouns. In this case, the “abstract” noun referred to a nation, that is, a collection of people and the locations where they lived[1](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/247092/why-do-the-names-of-so-many-places-end-in-ia). Many countries have “land” as a suffix, like England, Poland, Switzerland, etc., which means ‘the land of the English’, ‘the land of the Swiss’, etc. Many other countries have “stan” as a suffix, like Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Afghanistan, etc. [‘Stan’ means land in their language, it became ‘the land of the Kazakh’, ‘the land of the Turkmen’, etc](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/451387/country-names-ending-in-ia)
