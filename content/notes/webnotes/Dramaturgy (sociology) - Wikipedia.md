**Dramaturgy** is a [sociological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology "Sociology") perspective commonly used in [micro-sociological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsociology "Microsociology") accounts of social interaction in everyday life.

The term was first adapted into sociology from the theatre by [Erving Goffman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erving_Goffman "Erving Goffman"), who developed most of the related terminology and ideas in his 1956 book, _[The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Presentation_of_Self_in_Everyday_Life "The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life")_. [Kenneth Burke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Burke "Kenneth Burke"), whom Goffman would later acknowledge as an influence,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramaturgy_(sociology)#cite_note-1) had earlier presented his notions of _[dramatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramatism "Dramatism")_ in 1945, which in turn derives from [Shakespeare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_the_world%27s_a_stage "All the world's a stage"). The fundamental difference between Burke's and Goffman's view, however, is that Burke believed that life was in fact theatre, whereas Goffman viewed theatre as a metaphor. If we imagine ourselves as directors observing what goes on in the theatre of everyday life, we are doing what Goffman called dramaturgical analysis, the study of social interaction in terms of theatrical performance.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramaturgy_(sociology)#cite_note-mac-2): 133 

In dramaturgical sociology, it is argued that the elements of [human interactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_actions "Social actions") are dependent upon time, place, and audience. In other words, to Goffman, the [self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_(sociology) "Self (sociology)") is a sense of who one is, a dramatic effect emerging from the immediate scene being presented.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramaturgy_(sociology)#cite_note-ritz-3) Goffman forms a theatrical [metaphor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor "Metaphor") in defining the method in which one human being presents itself to another based on cultural [values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Values "Values"), [norms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(social) "Norm (social)"), and beliefs. Performances can have disruptions (actors are aware of such), but most are successful. The goal of this presentation of self is acceptance from the audience through carefully conducted performance.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramaturgy_(sociology)#cite_note-4) If the actor succeeds, the audience will view the actor as he or she wants to be viewed.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramaturgy_(sociology)#cite_note-5)[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramaturgy_(sociology)#cite_note-6)

A _dramaturgical action_ is a [social action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_action "Social action") that is designed to be seen by others and to improve one's public [self-image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-image "Self-image"). In addition to Goffman, this concept has been used by [Jürgen Habermas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Habermas "Jürgen Habermas") and [Harold Garfinkel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Garfinkel "Harold Garfinkel"), among others.
