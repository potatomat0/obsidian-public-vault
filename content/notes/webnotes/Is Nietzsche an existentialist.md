Whether Nietzsche is an existentialist is a matter of debate. Some scholars argue that he is, while others contend that he is not.

Those who argue that Nietzsche is an existentialist point to his emphasis on the individual, his rejection of traditional values, and his focus on the problem of meaning. They argue that Nietzsche's philosophy shares many of the same themes as existentialism, such as the importance of authenticity, the individual's responsibility for creating their own meaning, and the meaninglessness of the universe.

Those who argue that Nietzsche is not an existentialist point to his views on free will and determinism. They argue that Nietzsche's view of free will is more deterministic than the existentialist view, and that this undermines his claim that individuals are responsible for creating their own meaning. They also argue that Nietzsche's view of the universe is more pessimistic than the existentialist view, and that this undermines his claim that life can be meaningful.

Ultimately, whether Nietzsche is an existentialist is a matter of interpretation. There is no clear consensus among scholars on this issue.

Here are some of the similarities between Nietzsche's philosophy and existentialism:

- Both emphasize the individual and their freedom.
- Both reject traditional values and beliefs.
- Both focus on the problem of meaning.

However, there are also some important differences between Nietzsche's philosophy and existentialism:

- Nietzsche's view of free will is more deterministic than the existentialist view.
- Nietzsche's view of the universe is more pessimistic than the existentialist view.
- Nietzsche's philosophy is more focused on the individual's self-creation than on the individual's relationship to others.

In conclusion, whether Nietzsche is an existentialist is a matter of debate. There are both similarities and differences between his philosophy and existentialism.
