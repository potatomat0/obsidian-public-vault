1. Both Nepal and Tibet are situated near the Himalayas, and both claim Mount Everest and the Himalayas as part of their territory. Another similarity can be seen in the type of economy as well as elements of oppression in their histories.  
2. The capital of Nepal is Kathmandu, while the Tibetan capital is called Lhasa. Nepal is also known for the unique shape of its flag. Tibet also has its own flag.  
3. Another point of difference is sovereignty. Nepal is an independent [state](http://www.differencebetween.net/miscellaneous/politics/difference-between-state-and-society/) with a federal government at its head. Meanwhile, Tibet is classified as an autonomous region or a Chinese province. Nepal has one form of government, while Tibet has two –the Chinese government and a government in exile headed by the Dalai Lama.  
4. Nepal is considered a more developed place compared to Tibet. It has its own airport, radio, and university.  
5. Religion and language are other major points of comparison. Nepalese people are primarily Hindus with Buddhists and Muslims as minorities. On the other hand, Tibet has a unique Buddhism called Tibetan Buddhism. The Nepalese language is the primary language in Nepal; meanwhile, the Tibetan people have their own language but are also fluent in Chinese.
