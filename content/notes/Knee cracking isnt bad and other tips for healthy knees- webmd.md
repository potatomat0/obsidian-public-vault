[Knee Noises: Do You Need to Be Concerned About Pops and Cracks?](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/knee-pain/features/knee-cracks-pops)
_____
There's probably no reason for concern. Popping and cracking sounds usually aren't signs that something's wrong, they are the sound coming from the liquid inside the knee and the joints when your knee is making movement.

“A lot of joints crack and the [knees](https://www.webmd.com/pain-management/knee-pain/rm-quiz-know-your-knees) are a really common joint to crack,” says David McAllister, MD, director of the UCLA's Sports Medicine Program. “Most people have knees that crack when they squat down or go through the full arc of motion. **We generally don’t worry about cracking or popping when it isn’t associated with pain or swelling.**”

# Tips for healthy knees 

- Regular [exercise](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/ss/slideshow-7-most-effective-exercises) can strengthen your legs and knees. Exercise with weights or resistance bands -- or do bodyweight moves, like squats and lunges -- at least twice a week. Walk up stairs or hills, or ride a stationary bicycle to build muscle to support your knees.

- Warm up before you exercise. An intense workout with cold muscles and joints can cause injury.

- Keep flexible. Before exercise, try dynamic stretches, in which you move a muscle through a full range of motion. After exercise, do static stretches, where you hold a stretch for 30 seconds. This helps prevent injury. Regularly stretch the muscles in the front and back of your thigh (quadriceps and hamstrings, respectively).

- If you’re already exercising, slowly work up to harder, longer workouts.

- Wear shoes that fit right and are in good condition.

- Stay at a healthy weight. You’ll reduce stress on your knees. Being overweight is a major risk factor in developing early [arthritis of the knee](https://www.webmd.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/guide/knee-ra-rheumatoid-arthritis-of-the-knee).
