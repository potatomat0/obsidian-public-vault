## Definition 

Metaphysics is a branch of philosophy that studies the fundamental nature of reality. It asks questions about the nature of being, existence, identity, change, space and time, cause and effect, necessity, actuality, and possibility. Metaphysics is considered one of the four main branches of philosophy, along with epistemology, logic, and ethics.

The word "metaphysics" comes from the Greek words _meta_ ("after") and _ta physika_ ("the physical"). It was originally used to refer to the books that came after the books on physics in Aristotle's corpus. However, the term has since come to be used more generally to refer to the study of the fundamental nature of reality.

Some of the major questions that metaphysics seeks to answer include:

- What is the nature of being?
- What is the relationship between mind and matter?
- What is the nature of time and space?
- What is the nature of cause and effect?
- What is the nature of possibility and necessity?
- What is the nature of good and evil?

Metaphysics is a complex and challenging field of study, and there is no single answer to any of these questions. However, the study of metaphysics can help us to better understand the world around us and our place in it.

Here are some examples of metaphysical concepts:

- **Being:** This is the most fundamental concept in metaphysics. It refers to the fact that things exist.
- **Existence:** This is a more specific concept than being. It refers to the way in which things exist.
- **Purpose:** This is the idea that things have a reason for existing.
- **Universals:** These are abstract entities that are shared by many individual things. For example, the property of "redness" is a universal that is shared by all red things.
- **Properties:** These are the qualities that things have. For example, the apple has the property of being red.
- **Relations:** These are the connections between things. For example, the apple is related to the tree that it grew on.
- **Causality:** This is the relationship between cause and effect. For example, the apple falling from the tree caused it to hit the ground.
- **Space:** This is the three-dimensional realm in which things exist.
- **Time:** This is the one-dimensional realm in which things change.
- **Necessity:** This is the idea that something must be the way it is.
- **Actuality:** This is the idea that something is real or exists.
- **Possibility:** This is the idea that something could be real or exist.

## Popular approaches 

- **Platonism:** Plato believed that there are two worlds: the world of appearances, which is the world that we perceive with our senses, and the world of Forms, which is the world of perfect and unchanging ideas. The world of Forms is the true reality, and the world of appearances is a mere shadow of the Forms.
    
- **Aristotelianism:** Aristotle believed that there is only one world, and that it is made up of substances. Substances are things that exist in their own right, and they are made up of matter and form. Matter is the physical stuff that things are made of, and form is the structure or organization of matter.

- **Rationalism:** Rationalists believe that reason is the only reliable source of knowledge. They believe that we can come to know the true nature of reality through reason alone, without the need for sense experience.
    
- **Empiricism:** Empiricists believe that sense experience is the only reliable source of knowledge. They believe that we can only know things that we have experienced through our senses.
    
- **Idealism:** Idealists believe that the only thing that really exists is mind. They believe that the physical world is an illusion, and that it is created by the mind.
    
- **Materialism:** Materialists believe that the only thing that really exists is matter. They believe that the mind is simply a product of the brain, and that there is no such thing as a soul or spirit.
