[5 Tips on How to Be a Good Writer according to David Foster Wallace - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJJ68EWPeHs)
_____
1. Read dictionary, not ordinary dictionary, but *usage dictionary*
2. Write a good openning paragraph, this might be a broad advice, but already narrows down almost half of reader's first impression and how they would continue to read your work 
3. Keep down in mind that readers can't read the writer's mind, always focus on clarity 
4. Assume that the reader is smart
> The average person you're writing for is an acuted, sensitive, sophisticated, attentive reader who will appreciate adroitness, precision, economy and clarity

5. Puncuate process, not pronounce
> one measure of how good the writing is, is how little effort it requires the reader can track what's going on
