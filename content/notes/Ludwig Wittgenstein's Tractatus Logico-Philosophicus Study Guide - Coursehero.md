### Year Published

1921

### Type

Nonfiction

### Genre

Philosophy

### At a Glance

_Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus_ is a major work of modern philosophy and perhaps one of the most notable philosophical texts in the 20th-century analytic tradition. In it, author Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889–1951) claims to have resolved all the problems of philosophy to date. He does this by demonstrating—through the use of a logical analysis of philosophical language—that most of the work of philosophy is senseless because, ultimately, all logical propositions expressed in philosophy are tautologies. Wittgenstein argues that philosophers should only speak of the things they can say something substantive about, such as inferences derived from the natural sciences. On all other matters, from ethics to aesthetics, they should be silent. Wittgenstein's text is controversial and resists easy interpretation. For this reason it has stimulated much debate, including from Wittgenstein himself, who repudiated the _Tractatus_ in his later works.

### About the Title

_Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus_ is a Latin phrase meaning "treatise on logic and philosophy." The name is a reference to _Tractatus Theologico-Politicus_ (1670; "treatise on theology and politics"), a work by Dutch-Jewish philosopher Baruch Spinoza (1632–77). The title introduces the author's intent for his work to act as an important text on the subjects of logic and philosophy—one in which the logic demonstrations leave no room for doubting his conclusions.

# Main Ideas

## Philosophy is Limited

The main argument of _Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus_ is that philosophy is a severely limited, if not completely useless, exercise. The work serves primarily to elucidate, or bring to light, these severe limits. These limits have a simple cause: philosophers have to use language to picture and describe the world. In most cases philosophers of the past have not inquired deeply enough into the logic of their own language and how it is used. Worse, the lack of logical linguistic precision has been the cause of endless confusion. Wittgenstein believes that this confusion even exists in the works of Bertrand Russell and Gottlob Frege, two philosophers who devoted their energies to a rigorous logical analysis of the language used in philosophy.

Another limit of philosophy is that all philosophical propositions, when presented logically, turn out to be tautologies. That is, they consist of stating over and over again that a thing is true in all cases. If a thing is true in all cases, it cannot be discerned from other things and thus contains no sense. A tautology does not reveal anything about the world.

Wittgenstein uses his analysis to draw several conclusions. He says that philosophy is useful in the sense that it is a practice, not a theory. It is the practice of describing the limits of what can be thought or not thought. In essence, philosophy is nothing more than the practice of applying logic to the world. Wittgenstein pithily remarks that the only real use of philosophy may be to shoot down the ideas of those who think it can be used to speak of metaphysical or transcendental fields of study, like ethics or aesthetics. Wittgenstein calls for philosophers to read him, understand him, and move beyond philosophy.

## Saying Is Different to Showing

Wittgenstein distinguishes between saying something and showing something. To _say_ something is to express a fact. To _show_ something is to describe or express something about reality. Saying something or making a statement contains no more information than that something _is_. Showing allows for an elaboration of how things _are_. All facts must be logical because language follows logical rules of symbolism and meaning. A language cannot be illogical because if it does not logically produce meaning, it is not a language at all. A perfect language might be composed of individual signs that refer only to the individual things they signify. Even a perfect language, however, imposes a strict limit on philosophers. A perfect language would only allow philosophers to construct logical propositions. Wittgenstein demonstrates that propositions are only ever logical tautologies that state an obviously true thing about the world. They do not allow for the world to be described or explored. So, it is impossible for philosophers to truly _show_ something. It can only be _said_.

The manner in which something is shown is through the expression or description of a mind's pictures of the world. Humans do not access reality directly. Instead, they make pictures of the world. Wittgenstein distinguishes the natural sciences from philosophy by stating that the sciences are devoted to making such pictures, or models, of reality. The truth of the model is demonstrated by comparing it to reality. But this showing is all that humans are capable of, ultimately.

People are limited by their subjective experience. A person can only experience the world through their own thoughts and senses, what Wittgenstein calls the philosophical "I." A person's experience is not the world or a part of it because what they experience as the world is actually a model, or picture, in their own head. It is not reality, but rather a picture of reality. A person's subjective experience does not exist outside of their own selfhood and thus cannot be found in the outside world. When a person dies, the world, in this sense, is brought to an end.

## Whereof One Cannot Speak Thereof One Must Be Silent

Wittgenstein's text leads him to a blunt conclusion, which he states both in the preface and in the final proposition. What one cannot speak of, one should not speak of. Because Wittgenstein believes philosophy and logic are seriously and fundamentally limited, they cannot be used to analyze the subjects they have traditionally been tasked with analyzing. According to Wittgenstein, "ethics are transcendental," unable to be grasped by philosophy. Therefore, philosophers should no longer speak of ethics. Aesthetics, the examination of beauty, likewise are beyond the grasp of logic and must not be spoken of. So too with anything that is senseless.

With a single statement, Wittgenstein attempts to throw most philosophical thought out the window, which he then intends to keep shut by committing future philosophers to silence.

Wittgenstein's conclusion is revealed to be an exercise in demonstrating this fundamental truth. If readers understand Wittgenstein, he says, then they will know that everything in the text prior to the conclusion is senseless. Readers are left to decide whether to follow Wittgenstein's advice or not. It is a provocation for readers to think for themselves, understand the traps and errors of past philosophy, and attempt to forge ahead, finding those things about which they can speak. Philosophy, as it has been known, is done. Wittgenstein challenges the readers who understand him to find a new way of discussing the world.

# Context

## Analytic Philosophy

_Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus_ is a reaction to the development of analytic philosophy in the early 20th century. Analytic philosophy is generally based on arguments derived from the meanings or structures of words, terms, and phrases. It is distinct from absolute idealism, a form of philosophy developed by philosophers such as Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831) of Germany. Absolute idealism proposed that reality is a reflection of an infinite, universal, and unified mind, and each specific instance of thought or experience on a particular level happens in relation to this whole. Truth is coherence between thoughts rather than the relationship between thoughts and a reality that exists outside of the mind.

Analytic philosophy challenged the ideas of absolute idealists. The foundations of analytic philosophy are found in the works of British philosophers G.E. Moore (1873–1958) and Bertrand Russell (1872–1970). The field is characterized by a focus on language, hence the reason the advent of analytic philosophy is sometimes referred to as the "linguistic turn" in the history of philosophy. The paths Russell and Moore followed after this turn differed, with Russell focusing on the formal language of logic and Moore focusing on everyday, or ordinary, language.

[Ludwig Wittgenstein](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Tractatus-Logico-Philosophicus/key-figure-analysis/#Ludwig_Wittgenstein)'s _Tractatus_ _Logico-Philosophicus_ was also a reaction to the work of Gottlob Frege (1848–1925), another analytic philosopher, one whom [Wittgenstein](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Tractatus-Logico-Philosophicus/author/) admired. Frege, rather than put philosophy into everyday language, invented a logical method for analyzing sentences themselves. He was inspired by the development of mathematical logic happening in the 19th century, but Frege is credited with single-handedly inaugurating modern symbolic logic. Frege believed that logic, when properly applied, provided a true and universal set of laws. Wittgenstein's work uses a logical framework heavily inspired by Frege's own, although _Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus_ is intended as a criticism of the work of both Frege and Russell.

## Modernism

Although not a direct influence on Wittgenstein's philosophy, his approach to describing and articulating his ideas resonates with the modernist movement in the arts. Modernism arose in the early 20th century, in large part as a reaction to World War I (1914–18). The brutal horrors of modern warfare were a prime indicator that the world had profoundly changed and that previous artistic forms were no longer adequate to reflect this change. Modern also arose as a response to rapid changes in European society at the time. These changes included advances in the sciences and industry, and political and social reform. Modernist art sought to create a new form of artistic expression appropriate to the era by rejecting the expectations and traditions of literature of the past and by provoking audiences, using unusual forms of writing while exploring taboo or underrepresented subjects.

An excellent example of modernist literature is _Ulysses_, a novel by Irish writer James Joyce (1882–1941). _Ulysses_ was published in book form in 1922, the same year as the English translation of _Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus_. It is a dense text that uses stream of consciousness, a popular modernist technique in which the narrative is presented through the uninterrupted, unstructured flow of protagonists' thoughts. Joyce, and other modernist authors, used this technique to challenge the possibility of linearity in both life and narrative. Although _Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus_ is a work of philosophy rather than art, it possesses the same modernist sensibility in its willingness to provoke and question and its defiance of easy interpretation, which suggests that it is as much a modernist text as any other.

## Ethics

Ethics, or moral philosophy, is the branch of philosophy that deals with right and wrong. It is primarily concerned with questions of how humans can live a good life and whether good and evil are relative or absolute. Because of this, ethics is relevant to many other fields, including anthropology (the study of human cultures), politics (the theory of human political organization and practice), and theology (the study of religion and religious principles). In Western philosophy an important early figure in the study of ethics was the classical Greek philosopher Socrates (c. 470–399 BCE). Socrates taught that the secrets of living a good life could only be found through inquiry and debate. Ever since, philosophy and ethics have been closely tied together as subjects of inquiry.

Wittgenstein's text only addresses ethics directly in brief remarks toward the end. He states that ethics is not a subject philosophers should tackle and calls it "transcendental," or beyond the ability of language (and thus philosophy) to grasp or describe. However, he later insisted that his text had an "unwritten meaning" that was intensely ethical. The ethical message in the _Tractatus_ was unwritten precisely because Wittgenstein believed that ethics could not be written about. It is implied by the text, however. The brief discussion of ethics and the final passages of _Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus_ can be taken as expressing the hope that those who read his work and understand it will see the limits of language and thus move beyond them, to truly grasp what it means to live ethically.

Wittgenstein reinforced his belief that language was what prevented humans from grappling with ethics in his lecture on ethics, given in 1929. His contribution to the field of ethics was thus mostly to sow doubt that any past, present, or future ethical philosophy was possible. British philosopher Bertrand Russell, in his introduction to the _Tractatus_, stated that Wittgenstein's views on ethics left him with "a certain sense of intellectual discomfort." The _Tractatus_ did not end the philosophical study of ethics, but subsequent work has been forced to contend with Wittgenstein's intervention.

# Summary

## Summary

### Preface

[Wittgenstein](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Tractatus-Logico-Philosophicus/author/) says his intent is to address the problems of philosophy and that he believes language has limited the "expression of thoughts." He hopes his work will stimulate others to turn their minds to the same task he has attempted and that the text will show how little traditional philosophy has accomplished.

### Proposition 1

"The world is everything that is the case" is the first proposition. Everything that is "the case" is everything that exists. In a brief discussion Wittgenstein shows that he believes the world to be made up of facts, not objects. Facts exist in a realm of ideas called logical space, while objects are the stuff of material existence. What exists is made up of these facts. These facts exist in logical space, a theoretical realm defined and limited by what can be thought of logically. Logical space, it is implied, exists in the mind of the thinker. A fact is a specific point in this logical space.

### Proposition 2

"What is the case, the fact, is the existence of atomic facts" is the second proposition. That is, reality is made up of atomic facts. Atomic facts are individual ideas and are made up of material objects. Objects are the material elements of what Wittgenstein calls the "substance of the world." These atomic facts show both what does and what does not exist. Atomic facts are made up of objects chained together with logic, in sequence. They are also independent of one another.

A human mind makes models of reality, which Wittgenstein calls pictures. Pictures are mental representations of reality. The picture and reality must be related to one another. The elements of a picture correspond to the objects that make up atomic facts in reality. Thus, the picture and reality can be compared through the use of senses and thought. The truth of a picture is found by comparing it to reality.

### Proposition 3

"The logical picture of the facts is the thought" is the third proposition. A fact is thus something that is thinkable. A thing is thinkable if it is logical because it is impossible to think something illogical. It is impossible because thought is structured by language, which is logical. It is not possible to think outside of language, and thus it is not possible to think outside of logic. Likewise, language must be logical, and so it is impossible to express in language something illogical.

Wittgenstein calls the expression of a thought a proposition. A proposition is a sort of argument about what exists in reality. Wittgenstein describes how propositions are structured. Propositions that exist in a human mind are made up of "propositional signs." Propositional signs are the manner in which propositions are expressed in the world, in the form of writing, speaking, or making other symbols. Propositional signs are themselves made up of simple signs, which Wittgenstein calls "names." A name is a sign that means a specific thing—for instance, the word _dog_.

### Proposition 4

"The thought is the significant proposition" is the fourth proposition. Wittgenstein analyzes the language of philosophy and concludes that most philosophical ideas are not false, but senseless. That is, they express nothing of sense or meaning about the world.

### Proposition 5

"Propositions are truth-functions of elementary propositions" is the fifth proposition. The truth or falsity of propositions is determined by the truth or falsity of the elementary propositions from which they are made. Wittgenstein shows how the truth-function is formed by successively applying an operation of negating propositions to elementary propositions.

Wittgenstein engages in a lengthy discussion and argument about the use of language in philosophy. In particular, he argues with the work of Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell, two philosophers who he claims introduced unnecessary and confusing notation to the logical analysis of language. Wittgenstein aims at a logical language that can express philosophical propositions without confusion.

### Proposition 6

The sixth proposition is as follows: "The general form of truth-function is [p, ξ, N(ξ)]. This is the general form of proposition." Wittgenstein demonstrates that in logic, all propositions are tautologies—that is, statements that are true no matter what the facts of the world are. They are thus senseless because they give no information about facts in the world. Wittgenstein uses this insight to state that most philosophical questions and inquiries are themselves senseless. Philosophy cannot speak of matters such as ethics and aesthetics, which Wittgenstein refers to as "transcendental," meaning that they are in some sense outside the factual world philosophers describe through language. Therefore, the work of philosophy is to show the limits of thought by demonstrating the tautologies of propositions.

### Proposition 7

"Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent" is the seventh and final proposition. This provocative statement summarizes Wittgenstein's argument. He believes he has shown that philosophy is limited to what can be expressed or spoken of. On all other matters, philosophy is useless, and thus philosophers must remain silent about them.

# Preface | Summary

The author of _Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus_ broke the work into seven numbered sections. This study guide breaks these parts down further into smaller sections for clarity and digestibility.

## Key Takeaways

- Wittgenstein informs readers that his text is about the problems of philosophy. He believes the "method of formulating these problems rests on the misunderstanding of the logic of our language."
- The message of the book is summarized thus: "What can be said at all can be said clearly; and whereof one cannot speak thereof one must be silent." The book's purpose is to outline the limits of the "expression of thoughts."
- The limits of expression of thoughts are found in language. Anything outside this limit is nonsense.
- Wittgenstein writes that Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell inspired him. These two philosophers developed the analytic philosophy and style of logical language analysis that Wittgenstein himself deploys.
- There are two ways in which Wittgenstein considers his work valuable. The first is that it will stimulate others to turn their own minds to the task he has attempted. The second is that the text will show how little traditional philosophy has really accomplished.

# Sections 1.1–1.21 | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- Wittgenstein's first proposition is: "The world is everything that is the case." For something to be the case is equivalent to saying it exists. This means that the world, or reality, is made up of facts rather than things. Things are the material elements of reality. Wittgenstein does not believe that things exist outside of human experience. Instead, he argues that the world is made up of facts. Facts are ideas, or philosophical propositions.
- Wittgenstein develops this proposition. He says that the world is "the totality of facts, not of things." This is in contrast to philosophies that take the world to be made up of objects, or things, which is a development of the ideas of philosophers such as Immanuel Kant. Kant argued that there was a material world, but that humans could only access it imperfectly. According to Kant, the material world was experienced through the senses and then interpreted in the brain. Wittgenstein goes further and says that the world is only made up of facts, or philosophical propositions, that are demonstrated to be the case.
- What is "the case," or what is true, is determined by the "totality of facts." Truth is thus made up of the combination of all the facts that are true. Because the world (which is everything that is the case) is made up of a totality of facts, it follows that the world then "divides into facts."
- These facts exist in an imaginary realm that Wittgenstein calls "logical space." All facts that are logically possible exist in logical space. These facts may be "the case" (true) or "not the case" (false), but they must all be logical ideas. "A dog is a type of animal" is both logical and true. "A dog is a rodent" is logical but not true. "A dog is ambient" is neither logical nor true. The first two ideas exist in logical space, but the third does not.

# Sections 2.1–2.19 | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- Wittgenstein moves on to describe how humans perceive the world. He says that humans make "pictures of facts" for themselves. Making a picture is the process by which human minds perceive and build a model of the atomic facts that make up the world. The picture is not itself reality. Wittgenstein calls the picture a "model of reality."
- A picture is made up of elements that correspond to the objects in perceived reality. It is built from the way the elements of the picture correspond to each other, just as facts are built up from the way objects in the fact correspond to one another. This correspondence demonstrates a structural relationship between the picture and reality. The elements in the picture and reality are combined in the same way. Wittgenstein describes the resulting picture as "a fact."
- A picture is not reality, but a model of reality. However, picture and reality are related. The picture, Wittgenstein describes, attempts to replicate reality as if it reaches up to touch it. This reaching describes the way human minds attempt to build the most accurate model of reality.
- A picture and reality only touch one another at "the outermost points of the dividing lines." The picture must have some relationship to the object it is a picture of. Specifically, the structure of connections within the picture must mimic the structure of connections within the object. (This abstract relationship will be referred to as "isomorphism" by later thinkers, borrowing a term from mathematics.) Otherwise, it cannot be a fact (or a picture). But a picture can be true or false. That is, it can be a true or a false depiction of the object it represents.
- What all pictures have in common with reality is that they are represented logically—that is, they obey the rules Wittgenstein laid out earlier that state that reality is defined by what is possible. Logic is the means of expressing what is possible and is also how the picture of reality is expressed. For this reason, Wittgenstein calls logic the "form of reality." All pictures are thus logical pictures. Wittgenstein states that the logical picture "can depict the world."
# Sections 2.2–2.225 | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- Wittgenstein claims that what pictures represent is a possibility. A picture is a representation of the possibility of "the existence and non-existence of atomic facts." That is, a picture is a model of reality that shows a certain combination of atomic facts, including whether they exist. Different pictures (in the minds of different thinkers) differ in the combinations of atomic facts and which facts exist or do not exist.
- The picture itself contains and depicts possibility, meaning that pictures can be right or wrong, true or false. Whether it is true or false does not impact its status as a representation, however. A picture is always a representation so long as it depicts an object logically. If it is not logical, it is not a picture at all because reality is logical and a picture must represent reality.
- Wittgenstein calls the representation the "sense" of a picture. What he means is that the specific representation of reality within a given picture is what the picture "means."
- The truth or falsity of a picture is found in whether it agrees or disagrees with reality.
- To determine whether a picture is true, it has to be compared to reality. It is not possible to discern if a picture truly or falsely represents reality just by looking at it. A picture, or model of reality, is only true if it agrees with reality. A picture cannot simply, by its very nature, be true.
___
# Sections 3–3.05 | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- Wittgenstein's third proposition is: "The logical picture of the facts is the thought." Thoughts, like pictures, occur in the human mind. A human mind, using logic, produces a picture of atomic facts and forms a thought. Taken together, the totality of all true thoughts about reality would make a picture of reality itself. Wittgenstein states that atomic facts are "thinkable"; that is, it is possible for a human mind to think and understand them.
- As a logical picture of the facts that make up reality, the thought suggests a logically possible configuration of the elements that make up reality. Because thoughts must be logical, they must also be possible.
- Wittgenstein argues that it is impossible to think anything that is not logical. To think of something illogical is not to think at all, because Wittgenstein defines "thinking" as the process of producing "thoughts," which he has argued are always logical. A thought is defined by the fact that it is logical. It is impossible, Wittgenstein contends, to describe an illogical world.
- Because thoughts are logical and language is the means of expressing thought, it is impossible "to present in language anything which contradicts logic." Wittgenstein compares the example of language to geometry, in which it would be impossible to present anything that contradicts the laws of space.
- Language, thus, must itself be logical for it to represent reality. The meaning of words matters, as does the order in which words are put together into sentences, and sentences into phrases. Wittgenstein argues that words, with a definite meaning, are the building blocks of language. To produce sense, language has to place words with specific meanings in a specific order. Wittgenstein compares this to the argument he has made previously about atomic facts, which are also composed of material objects in a certain configuration.
- Wittgenstein explains why a thought cannot be true _a priori_. Something that is true _a priori_ is true without having to be demonstrated through evidence or observation. To be true _a priori_, a thought would be true without needing to compare it to reality. But for Wittgenstein, thoughts are only models of reality. They can only be true if they accurately model reality. To determine whether thoughts are true, it follows that they must be compared to reality and that they can neither be true nor untrue intrinsically. In making this argument, Wittgenstein is disagreeing with Kant, who argued that there were some fundamental truths that existed _a priori_. Kant's chief example was mathematics. Wittgenstein suggests instead that mathematics are not true _a priori_, but only by demonstrating their correspondence with reality.
___
# Sections 3.1–3.144 | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- Wittgenstein moves on, introducing a new concept he calls "the proposition." The proposition is the expression or assertion of a thought. While thoughts are formed in the mind, propositions exist in the world. Propositions are expressed or indicated through "signs." For instance, an argument can be expressed in written language.
- Wittgenstein calls the means of expressing thoughts "the propositional sign." The propositional sign is a fact. It is not just a mixture of words. The words in a propositional sign are chained together in a logical relationship.
- Wittgenstein claims that everyday language, whether written or spoken, does not show that a propositional sign is a fact. Everyday language even hides it. He suggests that readers should think of a propositional sign as made up of spatial objects rather than written signs. Wittgenstein wants his readers to stop thinking about propositional signs in terms of language, and to think about them in terms of objects in the world. If readers think about objects and not words, Wittgenstein contends, then they will see that the propositional sign is a fact.
- Wittgenstein concludes that thoughts can be described, rather than names. That is, they cannot simply be labeled and put into categories. Instead, propositional signs indicate a possibility, or a relationship between thoughts and reality. Wittgenstein compares propositional signs to arrows that point in a certain direction. He wants his readers to think of propositional signs as the indicators of thoughts, and not mistake them for elements of reality.
- Wittgenstein argues that when a person writes, they do not write down a proposition. Instead, they use words and sentences to make a "propositional sign," which is a piece of language that is related to the proposition but is not itself the proposition. Wittgenstein thus distinguishes a thought (the proposition) from the articulation of a thought (the propositional sign).
___
# Sections 3.2–3.263 | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- In a proposition, or an argument about the world, the objects of a thought correspond to the elements of the propositional sign, the expression of the proposition. Propositions are expressions of thoughts, and thoughts are made up of objects. Wittgenstein now calls these objects "simple signs." He also calls them "names." A name, or simple sign, is a sign that indicates the object, and only the object. The meaning of the name "car" is the object someone means when they say "car." Likewise, a picture of a car means the object "car."
- Just like atomic facts, propositional signs are built from simple signs, or names, in a specific configuration. In a propositional sign, the simple signs are in the same configuration as the objects in reality they are describing. What this means is that the structure of the propositional sign and the structure of objects in reality correspond. They have a relationship to one another, as a picture does to reality.
- Wittgenstein argues that the nature of signs and objects means that objects cannot be named but can only be described. In other terms, it is possible to say "how" a thing is but not "what" it is.
- There is only one way to completely understand a proposition, that is, an assertion of a thought. Propositions express or articulate a thought in a clear and complete way. Names, on the other hand, can only define. They do not articulate a thought; they mean a thing. Wittgenstein calls names "primitive signs."
- Primitive signs have meaning. These meanings are explained by what Wittgenstein calls "elucidations." An elucidation is a proposition that unpacks and describes the meaning of the primitive signs. _Elucidation_ means bringing to light or making clear. Wittgenstein suggests that, as a result, propositions can only be understood if the meanings of the signs are also known.

- A proposition is like a coordinate on a map of an imaginary logical space. The propositional sign acts as directions to finding the proposition itself. Logical space is the realm of ideas where all propositions exist. Humans interpret logical space and find individual propositions by their propositional signs.
- A proposition is a specific point in logical space. But logical space is not a vacuum. It is filled with all logical propositions. A proposition, Wittgenstein argues, necessarily assumes the existence and structure of logical space and other propositions. That is, the structure of one proposition provides someone with knowledge of the rules of logic and how propositions can be formed. Thus, propositions can show a person the logical structure of other propositions.

## Key Takeaways

- Wittgenstein returns to atomic facts and their relationship to propositions. He asserts that a proposition "presents the existence and non-existence of atomic facts." That is, a proposition is an argument about which atomic facts exist in reality and which do not. The totality of true propositions is "the totality of the natural sciences." However, Wittgenstein states that philosophy is not one of the natural sciences. By "natural sciences," he is referring to fields like physics, chemistry, and biology that investigate the material world and discover the facts and laws that make up reality.
- Philosophy is not a natural science. Instead, it is the activity of clarifying human thoughts through logic. Wittgenstein calls these clarifications using logic _elucidations_. The point of philosophy is not to produce propositions, but to make those propositions clear.
- Wittgenstein summarizes his point about philosophy by saying it should be used to "limit the thinkable and thereby the unthinkable." In short, the work of philosophy is the work of sorting sense from nonsense, using the tools provided by logic. The facts of the world are in the world. Philosophy does not produce them. It only clarifies the process of human thinking and describing. To emphasize his focus on clarity, Wittgenstein says, "Everything that can be thought at all can be thought clearly." The same is true of speech.
- Propositions can represent all reality. They cannot represent the logical form, however. To try to represent logic someone would have to place propositions outside of logic and reality, which is impossible. It is impossible because a proposition cannot be illogical or unrelated to reality. If it is either of those things, it is not a proposition at all.
- Objects and atomic facts, and their structures, possess what Wittgenstein calls "formal properties." Formal properties are the specific qualities of the objects, and atomic facts that define them. These properties determine the structure of atomic facts, objects, and propositions. An object, fact, or proposition has a formal property if it is "unthinkable that its object does not possess it." He gives the example of two shades of the color blue. The shades have a relationship in terms of the lightness or darkness of color, and it is unthinkable that they would not have this relationship.

## Key Takeaways

- Wittgenstein turns to explaining how propositions have meaning, or sense. Wittgenstein states that the sense (or meaning) of a proposition consists of whether it agrees or disagrees with whether the existence of an atomic fact is possible. That is, the meaning comes from the statement the proposition makes about the existence of atomic facts in reality.
- He discusses the simplest form of a proposition—the "elementary proposition." An elementary proposition "asserts the existence of an atomic fact." That is, an elementary proposition is a statement about one atomic fact only. For example, it is like saying that "water is wet" without making any other claims about water. An elementary proposition cannot be contradicted by another elementary proposition. "Water is wet" cannot be contradicted by "water is dry." They cannot both be true.
- Elementary propositions consist of names. Names are the simple signs Wittgenstein described before. He calls elementary propositions "a connection ... of names." To use the previous example, both "water" and "wet" are names, while "water is wet" is an elementary proposition.
- Wittgenstein claims that any analysis of propositions must eventually come down to the consideration of elementary propositions. Elementary propositions are the building blocks of propositions, just as atomic facts are made up of objects. Even the most complex things are made up of potentially infinite, atomic components.
- Names are simple symbols, indicated by single letters (_x_, _y_, _z_). Wittgenstein says the elementary proposition is the function of the names (_fx_). If two signs have the same meaning, then Wittgenstein uses the "=" symbol to show this, such as "_a_=_b_." He points out that while "_a_=_b_" expresses that the two signs symbolize the same thing, the expression reveals nothing about the meaning of the signs "_a_" or "_b_."
- Wittgenstein posits that the entire world can be described using a specification of all elementary propositions plus a specification of which of these elementary propositions is true or false. He believes that to comprehend propositions at all, it is necessary to comprehend the elementary propositions.
- Wittgenstein begins using two terms: "truth-possibilities" and "truth-conditions." A truth-possibility presents the possibilities of a proposition being true or false. A truth-condition is a statement that a proposition is true or that it is false.
- Wittgenstein identifies two extreme cases of "truth-conditions," which are the conditions of being either true or false. He labels the first truth-condition a "tautology." A tautology occurs when a proposition is true in all possibilities of being true or false for elemental propositions. He labels the second truth-condition a "contradiction." A contradiction occurs when a proposition is false in all possibilities.
- Wittgenstein argues that propositions show what they say. That is, the statement of the proposition is demonstrated by the proposition. Wittgenstein says they have sense, or meaning. Tautologies and contradictions say nothing. Tautologies are unconditionally true, and contradictions are unconditionally false. They are, in Wittgenstein's terms, senseless (as distinct from sense and nonsense). Wittgenstein uses an example: if he knows that it does rain or that it does not rain (as opposed to the fact that it is raining or is not raining), he does not know anything about the weather as it currently stands. Tautology and contradiction are pictures of reality because one states all possible conditions and the other none.

# Sections 4.5–4.53 | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- Wittgenstein provides the most general form of proposition, which is a language in which "every possible sense can be expressed by a symbol."
- Wittgenstein describes how he might go about constructing such a language. First, he asks if he would have access to all elementary propositions in reality. If all elementary propositions were at his disposal, Wittgenstein says he would then ask himself what propositions he could build out of them. If he has all the elementary propositions, he says he would only build propositions in his language. The ability to only build propositions from elementary propositions in reality, he claims, is a limit on what he can do. He has no room for creativity or to create confusion.
- Wittgenstein states that the general propositional form is a variable. Generally, a proposition has the quality of being either true or false, and thus variable.
___
# Sections 5–5.156 | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- Wittgenstein states that along with truth-possibilities and truth-conditions, there are "truth-functions." A truth function is a logical process that takes a true or false statement as its input and produces a true or false statement as its output. Wittgenstein asserts that "propositions are truth-functions of elementary propositions." That is, propositions are dependent on the truth of the elementary propositions from which they are made. Propositions are the output, whereas the elementary proposition is the input.
- Truth-functions can be placed in an ordered series. Doing so is the foundation of probability (the branch of mathematics dealing with whether something will happen). Wittgenstein says that the truth-possibilities of elementary propositions make up the "truth-grounds" of a proposition. The truth-grounds are the basis on which someone can say that a proposition is true or false. The truth-grounds of one proposition, if they are the same as the truth-grounds of other propositions, are said to follow from those other propositions being true.
- Propositions exist in relationships of one proceeding from another, so Wittgenstein says that "a proposition asserts every proposition which follows from it." The truth-grounds of the subsequent propositions follow from the truth-grounds of the earlier proposition. On the other hand, propositions are said to be opposed if no proposition asserts them both. Opposed propositions contradict each other. They cannot both be true.
- It is possible to find out if a proposition follows from another by examining the structure of each proposition. The truth-grounds are internal to the propositions and their structure. Nothing can be inferred externally because an inference is an _a priori_ assertion. The only way to determine if propositions agree is to compare them to each other.
- Some propositions share no "truth-arguments" in common with other propositions. A truth-argument is an argument that if one proposition is true or false, then another proposition must follow that must be true or false. These are independent propositions.
- Wittgenstein claims that probability is a generalization. Probability is a general description of propositions, their truth, and their relationship to one another. People need to use probability precisely because they cannot be certain about future events: "Events of the future cannot be inferred from those of the present."
___
# Sections 5.2–5.32 | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- Wittgenstein moves on to consider the structures of propositions. This consideration is important in determining whether propositions follow from one another, as he said earlier. The structures of propositions "stand to one another in internal relations." What this means is that propositions are linked together in terms of their relationships to one another. People can express these relations by saying, for instance, that one proposition being true is a result of another being false. To express how a proposition leads into or follows from another, a "truth-operation" must be performed. As Wittgenstein has suggested, it is possible to see how propositions follow from one another by examining their structures. The structure is formed of elemental propositions and truth-conditions. If the structures agree, the truth-operation expresses that the propositions follow. If they do not, the truth-operation shows that they do not.
- Operations are not forms or objects. They are only expressions of the difference between forms. An operation is not used to express the meaning of propositions, only the relationships between propositions.
- The product of a truth-operation is a truth-function. Wittgenstein has said before that truth-functions arise from elementary propositions. The truth-operation is the process a person performs to examine elementary propositions and reveal the truth-function. Truth-operations can be applied repeatedly, producing a series of truth-functions as their product. Wittgenstein says that this successive or repeated operation can be expressed with the phrase "and so on."
- Truth-operations can reverse, cancel one another, and vanish.
- Wittgenstein states that "truth-operations" are the means by which "truth-functions" arise from elementary propositions. He concludes that all truth-functions are the result of the successive applications of a certain (finite) number of truth-operations on elementary propositions.
___
# Sections 5.4–5.476 | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- Bertrand Russell and Gottlob Frege had proposed that there are things in logic called "logical objects" and "logical constants." Russell and Frege believed that logical constants were the basic atomic facts of logic from which all other logical statements could be constructed. Wittgenstein takes aim at that view in this section.
- Wittgenstein argues that logical objects or constants do not exist. He says Russell and Frege were wrong to assert that their logical constants were primitive signs. He argues that logical constants are not primitive signs at all because they can be defined in different ways or exchanged with one another to produce meaning. Wittgenstein insists that a primitive sign must mean one thing and one thing only.
- Wittgenstein argues that there is only one constant in logic: all propositions have one thing in common with each other. This commonality is the general propositional form, or the general manner in which all propositions are expressed.
- Wittgenstein argues that Russell and Frege's arguments about logic were a waste of time. He thinks it is not possible to think illogically because if a thought is illogical it is not really a thought at all. Wittgenstein wishes to move beyond discussions of the structure of logic. What interests him instead is the structure of propositions.
___
# Sections 5.5–5.641 | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- Wittgenstein returns to discussing truth-functions because he has dispensed with the idea that it is necessary to examine the structure of logic itself. Truth-functions result from successively applying a specific operation to elementary propositions, which he writes as N[ξ]. The operation consists of negating or denying all the propositions in the bracket (indicated by the Greek letter _Xi_). Wittgenstein calls this operation the "negation of ... propositions."
- This section largely consists of a discussion of notation in logic. In particular, Wittgenstein takes issue with the introduction of symbols to logic that he deems unnecessary and confusing because they distract from clear expression.
- For instance, Wittgenstein says that he expresses the identity of an object with the identity of the sign, not by "means of a sign of identity." By this statement, he means that he can simply use the sign itself, not an additional symbol. If "_a_=_b_," he can simply state "_a_" twice because it is a sign for the same variable.
- Continuing to argue against Bertrand Russell and Gottlob Frege, Wittgenstein claims there is no hierarchy of "the forms of the elementary propositions." Elementary propositions themselves form the totality of "empirical reality." Any hierarchy imposed upon them would be "independent of reality." A hierarchy implies that some elementary propositions are more important than others. Wittgenstein thinks this is not so. He thinks any attempt to impose a hierarchy upon reality comes from the human imagination and is not derived from reality or the examination of what exists. It is thus independent of reality—it has no relationship to it.
- The limit of language is the limit of the world. The world is logical, and so the limit of the world is also the limit of logic. It follows that people cannot think things it is impossible to think logically, and they cannot say what they cannot think.
- Wittgenstein moves on to the subject of "solipsism," which is the belief that only the self exists. Wittgenstein states that solipsism is in a sense true because the world exists in the mind and is described in the language of the individual. He summarizes by saying, "The world and life are one ... I am my world."
- The self is not a part of the world. Instead, the self is the limit of what a person can experience. Wittgenstein calls the self the "limits of the world." That is, what a person can think and experience is limited by the fact that they inhabit a single human body. A person cannot access the world beyond their senses, thoughts, and experiences. Wittgenstein's view is that what someone can talk about is limited by the existence of "the philosophical I," which is a way of addressing the notion that all humans exist as a self in their own head and body. Effectively, people are limited in what they can think about and do because they are individual humans. What this idea means is that "the philosophical I" is not something that can be found in the world, but rather the individual experience and understanding of the world.

# Sections 6–6.13 | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- The general form of the truth-function is provided as [p, ξ, N(ξ)]. What this function means is that "every proposition is the result of successive applications of the operation N'(ξ)" to elementary propositions. Moving to mathematics, Wittgenstein argues that "a number is the exponent of an operation." He says that a number, conceptually, is that which is common to all numbers, or the general form of "number." That is, all numbers have in common that they are a number, which is an expression of a value or quantity. Although one is more than two, and a million far more than one, all of them are expressions of a value. That is their general form.
- Provocatively, Wittgenstein contends that "the propositions of logic are tautologies," and because they are tautologies, they say nothing. Propositions are tautologies because of the formal and logical properties of language and the world.
- The logical properties of propositions are demonstrated by combining propositions into tautologies, which by definition say nothing. Wittgenstein calls this process a "zero-method." If a proposition is logical, then the propositions are brought into equilibrium, or balance, with one another.
- Logical propositions "describe the scaffolding of the world." Logic contains all the necessary signs to provide this scaffolding. If a language has logical syntax, then all "propositions of logic are already given." There must be logic for there to be language.
- Wittgenstein contends that nothing surprising can ever be found in logic. He concludes his musings on logic by saying, "Logic is not a theory, but a reflection of the world. Logic is transcendental." That is, logic belongs to a higher realm of thoughts than philosophy is capable of accessing.
___
# Sections 6.2–6.3751 | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- Mathematics, Wittgenstein asserts, is a logical method. Its propositions are equations. These propositions, however, do not express thoughts. Mathematics is used only when someone wants to find out which propositions belong to mathematics and which do not. In the same manner that philosophy describes the logic of the world in tautologies, mathematics does so in equations.
- Wittgenstein states that scientific facts are not a part of logic. Science is the realm of observation, not logic. For instance, Wittgenstein calls the law of causality "the form of a law" but not a law itself. The law of causality states that actions have consequences and events are caused by earlier events. But people can only determine causes and effects through observation and experience, not through logic.
- Scientists can produce pictures of reality drawn from experience and inference. Mechanics, for instance, is an attempt to produce "all true propositions which we need for the description of the world." The descriptions produced, however, are general rather than specific. What mechanics is describing is not nature itself, but the model of nature that mechanics is constructing.
- Logically, there is no reason for one thing to happen because another happened. Wittgenstein says that modern thinking is in error when it believes that "the so-called laws of nature are the explanations of natural phenomena." In a way, he suggests that modern humans are more at a loss than ancient humans because modern humans believe that everything is explained. Ancients instead believed there was a realm of mystery humans could not comprehend. The laws of nature are not true laws but rather models humans have built to describe observed phenomena.

# Sections 6.4–6.54 | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- Wittgenstein states that "all propositions are of equal value." This declaration means that there is no hierarchical order to propositions, again arguing against Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell.
- The sense of the world lies outside the world. There is no intrinsic meaning to anything in the world, only the meaning the self (which Wittgenstein has argued is outside the world) imposes upon it.
- Because there is nothing in the world that is intrinsically ethical, Wittgenstein says, "there can be no ethical propositions." A proposition cannot express anything higher than logic. Ethics, to Wittgenstein, is a higher concern than propositions. It is something that cannot be expressed and is thus transcendental.
- Ethics cannot be founded on a statement about punishment and reward. Ultimately, ethics is a subject that cannot be spoken of. Good or evil human wills do not change the facts of the world. They only impose limits on the world as experienced by the individual human self because they affect who lives and dies, for how long, and under what circumstances.
- Upon the death of the self (meaning the physical death of a human being), the world does not change, but merely stops. Wittgenstein is clear that he means that the world is limited by human perception. People cannot experience anything outside the time in which they are alive, and so in a sense, death is the end of the world. Wittgenstein argues that death is not a part of life; it is the cessation of life. Wittgenstein muses that human beings cannot know if the human soul survives after death. He says it is not guaranteed. He says that the riddle of life does not lie within space and time, but outside of them. It is not something science or philosophy can speak of.
- Facts do not describe _how_ the world is; only _that_ it is. The how is the realm of what Wittgenstein calls the "mystical."
- Wittgenstein argues that there are questions that can be asked, and if so, they can be answered. A question is defined by the fact that it can be answered. Wittgenstein thus says there is no such thing as a riddle, only questions and non-questions.
- Even if science could answer all possible scientific questions, it would still not solve the problems of life. The only solution to the problem of life is found in its end, upon death.
- Wittgenstein describes the "right method of philosophy." That is, nothing should be said except those things that can be said. These are based on the propositions of natural science, which are not part of philosophy at all. The philosopher should then demonstrate to others who wish to speak of the metaphysical (that which lies outside of natural science) that they cannot truly do so. Wittgenstein remarks that others would find this unsatisfying but that this is the only correct method to practice philosophy.
- Wittgenstein asserts that propositions are "elucidatory"—anyone who understands them will recognize them as senseless. Upon this recognition, readers will have climbed over and surpassed Wittgenstein. If they do so, they will "see the world rightly."

#  Section 7 | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- The text ends with a final proposition: "Whereof one cannot speak thereof one must be silent." This means that if there is nothing useful or true to say about something, it is better not to say anything at all.
- Wittgenstein claimed that his text solved all the problems of philosophy. His final message suggests that anything outside of the terms he has defined in the text is beyond the realms of things philosophy can usefully speak of.
- Wittgenstein includes himself and his own work in this and suggests that his work is nonsense. In a sense, his entire work has led to the conclusion that it would be better not to have said anything at all.

# Quotes

1.

 > The problem of philosophy ... rests on the misunderstanding of the logic of our language. 

[Ludwig Wittgenstein](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Tractatus-Logico-Philosophicus/key-figures/#Ludwig_Wittgenstein), [Preface](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Tractatus-Logico-Philosophicus/preface-summary/)

In this quote Wittgenstein addresses the topic his book will explore. He makes a bold claim that his text will explore the fundamental "problem of philosophy." This problem is the failure of philosophers to reckon with the logic of their language. By "language," Wittgenstein is referring to the specific language of philosophy rather than ordinary language. Wittgenstein establishes that logic and especially the logic of language will be at the core of his argument.

2.

> The picture is a model of reality. 

[Ludwig Wittgenstein](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Tractatus-Logico-Philosophicus/key-figures/#Ludwig_Wittgenstein), [Sections 2.1–2.19](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Tractatus-Logico-Philosophicus/sections-21-219-summary/)

Wittgenstein reveals in this quote that he does not believe humans experience reality objectively. Instead, he believes they make pictures of reality. The word _picture_ references the imagery of an artwork or photograph. A picture is not the thing, but it does depict the thing. Likewise, a mental picture must also have a relationship with the reality it depicts.

3.

 > The totality of true thoughts is a picture of the world. 

[Ludwig Wittgenstein](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Tractatus-Logico-Philosophicus/key-figures/#Ludwig_Wittgenstein), [Sections 3–3.05](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Tractatus-Logico-Philosophicus/sections-3-305-summary/)

Wittgenstein defines "a picture of the world" as nothing less than the totality of all thoughts as he has defined them. He means that it is theoretically possible to construct a picture of the world, or of reality. He also signifies that reality exists but that it is not accessible or comprehensible to a human mind except as a picture. Wittgenstein is showing how what philosophers are engaged in is the creation or criticism of pictures, not a description of reality as it exists.

4.

> To present in language anything which 'contradicts logic' is ... impossible. 

[Ludwig Wittgenstein](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Tractatus-Logico-Philosophicus/key-figures/#Ludwig_Wittgenstein), [Sections 3–3.05](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Tractatus-Logico-Philosophicus/sections-3-305-summary/)

Wittgenstein's text is foremost a discussion of logic. Logic, he says, is really the only thing philosophers can talk about. In this quote he shows that language must be logical. It cannot contradict logic because it follows logical rules of meaning. If it does not, it is not a language, but nonsense. Wittgenstein's reliance on strict rules of logic restricts what he thinks can be said.

5.

> The name means the object. The object is its meaning. 

[Ludwig Wittgenstein](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Tractatus-Logico-Philosophicus/key-figures/#Ludwig_Wittgenstein), [Sections 3.2–3.263](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Tractatus-Logico-Philosophicus/sections-32-3263-summary/)

Wittgenstein is reacting to earlier philosophers who busied themselves defining or naming objects, types, and ideals. He is trying to construct a truly logical philosophical language, and therefore his definition of names and objects is blunt and simple. A name can only mean the object it names, or else it is not the name of the object. A name has no other use than to symbolize an object.

6.

> Most propositions and questions ... are not false, but senseless. 

[Ludwig Wittgenstein](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Tractatus-Logico-Philosophicus/key-figures/#Ludwig_Wittgenstein), [Sections 4–4.0641](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Tractatus-Logico-Philosophicus/sections-4-40641-summary/)

With this simple statement, Wittgenstein attacks much of what has been written in philosophy up to this point. He says, bluntly, that most philosophy is neither right nor wrong. It is simply senseless and does not mean anything. He believes it should be dismissed because it is a waste of time to discuss it. Discussing it will not lead to meaning or revelation, only more nonsense. With this statement, Wittgenstein reiterates his categorization of the three states of meaning: sense, nonsense, and senselessness. Most propositions and questions contain no sense, or representation of reality, so they are senseless. If they were illogical, they would be nonsense.

7.

> The proposition shows how things stand, if it is true. 

[Ludwig Wittgenstein](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Tractatus-Logico-Philosophicus/key-figures/#Ludwig_Wittgenstein), [Sections 4–4.0641](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Tractatus-Logico-Philosophicus/sections-4-40641-summary/)

Wittgenstein believes that the ultimate value of a proposition is that it can show how things stand—that is, it can function as a description of reality, but only if it is true. A proposition cannot say anything more than whether the idea it expresses is true. This means that propositions cannot be used to describe or explore anything beyond what is contained in the proposition.

8.

> Philosophy is not a theory but an activity. 

[Ludwig Wittgenstein](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Tractatus-Logico-Philosophicus/key-figures/#Ludwig_Wittgenstein), [Sections 4.1–4.128](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Tractatus-Logico-Philosophicus/sections-41-4128-summary/)

Wittgenstein's work has aimed at proving this point. He wants to show that philosophy is not a theory or a fixed body of knowledge. If it were, it would be a science. Philosophy is instead an activity, or a process. It is a thing one does when thinking, not a thing one knows. Specifically, Wittgenstein believes that philosophy is the activity of sorting sense from nonsense and senselessness. It is the process of testing the truth or falsehood of propositions by comparing them to reality. Wittgenstein wants readers to accept that philosophy is a way of thinking and acting. He hopes readers will accept what he is saying and move past him by exploring new modes of thought and using philosophical practice.

9.

> He who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless. 

[Ludwig Wittgenstein](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Tractatus-Logico-Philosophicus/key-figures/#Ludwig_Wittgenstein), [Sections 6.4–6.54](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Tractatus-Logico-Philosophicus/sections-64-654-summary/)

Wittgenstein has revealed that he believes his propositions to be nonsense, or "senseless." But here, he claims that they do serve a purpose. He says that if readers will know his propositions are senseless, they can lift themselves out of the tricky problems of traditional philosophy. The statement also hides an implicit criticism. Wittgenstein suggests that people who remain fixated by traditional philosophical questions after reading the text have not understood it.

10.

> Whereof one cannot speak thereof one must be silent. 

[Ludwig Wittgenstein](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Tractatus-Logico-Philosophicus/key-figures/#Ludwig_Wittgenstein), [Section 7](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Tractatus-Logico-Philosophicus/section-7-summary/)

This sentence translates to "If one cannot talk about something, one shouldn't talk about it." It is a pithy summary of Wittgenstein's chief point. He believes that traditional philosophical propositions are senseless and that he has solved the problems of philosophy by demonstrating this senselessness. He is also taking the blame by saying that he should not have spoken about things he could not speak about, but he did so to prove this point.

# Biography

### Early Life

Ludwig Josef Johann Wittgenstein was born April 26, 1889, in Vienna, Austria, to Karl Otto Clemens Wittgenstein (1847–1913) and Leopoldine Maria Josefa Kalmus (1850–1926). He was the last of the couple's eight children. Wittgenstein's father owned practically all of Austria's steel production and supply, making the Wittgenstein family one of the wealthiest families in Europe, a position of prominence that ensured the family's connection with some of the most renowned and accomplished figures of the time, including Austrian psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud (1856–1939) and German composer Johannes Brahms (1833–97).

No mere spectators of talent, the Wittgenstein siblings were educated in the Catholic tradition and trained in the musical arts, for which the young Ludwig demonstrated a remarkable proclivity. But Wittgenstein's earliest studies were in neither music nor philosophy, the subjects for which he would become famous. He instead studied aeronautical engineering at the University of Manchester in England beginning in 1908. The applied mathematical problems of engineering eventually led Wittgenstein to the more abstract realms of pure mathematics and logic.

In pursuit of his new passion, Wittgenstein went to Cambridge University in 1911 to study with British logician and philosopher Bertrand Russell (1872–1970). Both Russell and Wittgenstein soon came to believe that Wittgenstein had exhausted what he could learn at Cambridge. He left Cambridge in 1913 and went to Norway to do philosophy in solitude.

### Family Status and Personality

Wittgenstein was a famously intense and demanding person, a personality fed by the wealth and position of his family. Because the family was so prominent and had access to so much, a great deal was expected of the Wittgenstein children. Ludwig seemed rarely to live up to his own expectations—and other people didn't either. His obsessive intensity is traced by some authors to the influence of the Austrian philosopher Otto Weininger (1880–1903), whose work greatly impressed Wittgenstein. Weininger's _Sex and Character_ (1903) argues that the purpose of a worthy life is to create greatly influential work—anything less is not worth doing.

The wealth of the Wittgenstein family ensured that Ludwig could go wherever he pleased to pursue whatever subject piqued his interest. But even where his family's name did not precede him, his intelligence and dedication made a good first impression. When he went to study under Bertrand Russell, the latter is said to have remarked on two different occasions, "An unknown German appeared at Cambridge ... obstinate and perverse, but I think not stupid."

Wittgenstein's intensity, perceived often as perversity (in the sense of being contrary to general expectation, rather than in the sexual sense), stemmed from his drive to accomplish something great that he had internalized from his reading of Weininger. Greatness—or genius—was for Wittgenstein a comprehensive phenomenon: it involved achieving "intellectual clarity and moral decency" in one's way of life.

One of the most famous incidents involving Wittgenstein's intense personality occurred at Cambridge University in the latter part of his career. David Edmonds (b. 1964) and John Eidinow's (b. 1950) book _Wittgenstein's Poker_, published in 2001, investigates the story of how Wittgenstein reputedly threatened Austrian-born British philosopher Karl Popper (1902–94) with a fireplace poker during an argument about the status and nature of philosophical problems.

### Nonphilosophical Endeavors

Wittgenstein did a great deal in addition to studying and writing philosophy in his adult professional life. When World War I began in 1914, Wittgenstein was in Austria and was not able to return to his scholar's hideaway in Norway. He joined the Austrian Army and worked in various engineering capacities with artillery. His most dangerous assignments involved directing artillery fire at the front lines in Italy and Russia. He received a number of awards for courage during his service.

After World War I ended (1918) and he completed _Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus_, which was published in 1921, Wittgenstein abandoned philosophy for a time. He considered himself to have solved all outstanding problems and to have made definitive conclusions about the possibilities of philosophical methodology. He worked alternately as a gardener and architect but mainly as a primary school teacher around Austria.

As a teacher, Wittgenstein was frequently harsh toward students who could not keep up with his lessons, and he generally found the people he interacted with intolerable. He wrote that the people at his first post in Trattenbach, Austria, were characterized by "odiousness and baseness," and that the people in Hassbach, Austria, were "not human at all, but loathsome worms." Finally, in Otterthal, Austria, he struck a student so violently that the student collapsed. Soon thereafter, Wittgenstein resigned and did not work as a schoolteacher again.

During World War II (1939–45), Wittgenstein again abandoned philosophy for a time to work at a hospital in London, performing the simple job of delivering drugs throughout the hospital.

### Early Philosophical Period: _Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus_

Wittgenstein's first philosophical work, published in 1921, is titled _Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus_ as an allusion to Dutch-Jewish philosopher Baruch Spinoza's (1632–77) _Tractatus Theologico-Politicus_ (1670). Both books explore the nature of the relation between hefty intellectual domains: Wittgenstein's on the relation between logic and philosophy and Spinoza's on the relation between theology and political and moral philosophy. Both works argue that the relation is a far cry from what most people take it to be.

### Late Philosophical Period: Philosophical Investigations

Though he had at one time thought that the work of _Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus_ had solved the problems of philosophy, Wittgenstein eventually returned to the discipline. His conversations with philosophers who were either critical of his earlier work or inspired by it were the impetus for his return. The primary figure in the former category was British philosopher and logician F.P. Ramsey (1903–30), who helped translate _Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus_ into English and himself made fundamental contributions to the fields of mathematics and logic. Ramsey's criticism of Wittgenstein's work in _Tractatus_ _Logico-Philosophicus_ convinced Wittgenstein that there was more to be said. Out of this reinvestigation emerged Wittgenstein's _Philosophical Investigations_, which was published posthumously in 1953. Wittgenstein was prepared to release _Philosophical Investigations_ as early as 1946. However, he withdrew the book from his publisher and continued working on it instead of publishing it at that time.

In the inspired category fall the intellectuals of the Vienna Circle, a group of scholars from whom the logical positivist movement arose. Logical positivism—picking up on Wittgenstein's categorization of statements as sensible, senseless, and nonsensical—sought to specify what kind of statements were meaningful and therefore worth consideration by the sciences, including philosophy. The so-called Verifiability Principle claimed that only statements that could be verified by empirical observation were meaningful. Notable philosophers of the Vienna Circle included Moritz Schlick (1882–1936), Rudolf Carnap (1891–1970), and Otto Neurath (1882–1945).

### Death and Legacy

Wittgenstein was philosophically active until his death from prostate cancer on April 29, 1951, at Cambridge. The last words from this man, who had always been driven to achieve intellectual and moral greatness, were: "Tell them I've had a wonderful life."

Other books have been published posthumously from Wittgenstein's notes and papers. Most notable are the so-called _Blue Book_ and _Brown Book_, named for the colors of their bindings. Wittgenstein never had any firm intention to publish either. The set of notes for each was meant either for his students (in the case of the _Blue Book_) or the friends whose feedback he valued (the _Brown Book_). These manuscripts are much like _Philosophical Investigations_ itself—though Wittgenstein's intention was to eventually publish _Investigations_ once he was satisfied with it.

Nearly everything Wittgenstein wrote has been an occasion for extensive scholarly commentary. For example, American philosopher and logician Saul Kripke (b. 1940) wrote a book-length treatment of Wittgenstein's arguments concerning rule-following and private language. (Kripke's interpretation of Wittgenstein is often referred to as "Kripkenstein"—a commentary on both its distinctiveness and its perceived distortion.) Kripke notes in the preface to his book, "Many well-known and significant topics [from _Philosophical_ _Investigations_] ... are hardly mentioned." He continues that he considers few of Wittgenstein's contributions to the discourse on "intention, memory, dreaming, and the like." However, the general consensus among professional philosophers is that Wittgenstein is among the most influential thinkers of the 20th century—for better or for worse. At the least, philosophers must be prepared to address his contributions in a wide array of philosophical topics.

The continued editorial efforts of people like P.M.S. Hacker (b. 1939) and Joachim Schulte (b. 1946) to create a clear and definitive version of Wittgenstein's work are a further testament to his enduring importance. Their work also explains in part the fascination with Wittgenstein's life. The largely scattered and unpublished nature of his writings requires scholars to learn a great deal about where Wittgenstein was and when, along with researching whom he was in contact with. Only by this process can they ascertain the full breadth of his work and how the manuscripts he left behind fit together. Further, Wittgenstein's life and personality have proven to be a subject of interest to the general public as well. David Edmonds and John Eidinow's book _Wittgenstein's Poker_, published in 2001, became a best seller.
