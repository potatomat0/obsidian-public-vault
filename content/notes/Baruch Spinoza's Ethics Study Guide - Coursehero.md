### Year Published

1677

### Type

Nonfiction

### Genre

Philosophy

### At a Glance

Published posthumously in 1677, the _Ethics_ is Dutch-Jewish philosopher Baruch (Benedict de) Spinoza's (1632–77) attempt to apply the formal reasoning of mathematics to a sweeping range of philosophical issues. Structured as a series of axioms, proofs, theorems, and polemical essays (those related to an aggressive attack on the ideas of another), the book argues in favor of several propositions regarding God, nature, and humanity that were highly controversial in Spinoza's time. Perhaps most notoriously, Spinoza denies the existence of a personal God. Instead he affirms that God and nature are fundamentally the same thing. Later in the work, he challenges the notion of free will and suggests that freedom is found in submission to reason rather than to emotion.

Although latter-day philosophers, as well as mathematicians, have questioned the rigor of Spinoza's so-called proofs, the _Ethics_ remains a major milestone in the philosophical heritage of the West. Its ambitious structure has inspired many subsequent attempts to address the broad concerns of philosophy by using the precise language of mathematics. Further, in its attempt to chart out the varieties and causes of human emotion, the _Ethics_ anticipates important aspects of modern psychology and sociology. No less important is the book's vision of a life well-lived: a life guided by reason, free from the chaos of blind urges and conflicting desires.

### About the Title

The title of Dutch-Jewish philosopher Baruch (Benedict de) Spinoza's (1632–77) _Ethics_ might suggest a misleadingly narrow impression of the text's contents. The book does in fact present several propositions concerning good, evil, and morality—topics that would be expected in a treatise on ethics. However, Spinoza also makes some extraordinary and—in his day, highly controversial—claims about the nature of God, the relationship of mind and body, and the origin of human emotions. Thus, in addition to ethics, Spinoza's work also covers metaphysics (nature of reality), philosophy of mind, and psychology.

# Main Ideas

## God as Nature

In Part 1 of the _Ethics_, Spinoza advances a view of God as essentially equivalent to nature—meaning not merely the observable physical world but all that exists. This view is sometimes referred to by Spinoza's original Latin expression _Deus sive Natura_: "God, or Nature." For Spinoza, all of nature is "in" God, and all natural things and phenomena are caused by God, who is the only "free cause" in the universe. This "freedom," however, is not to be confused with free will, which Spinoza denies as an attribute of God. Likewise, Spinoza argues that God does not have a physical presence—seemingly a direct challenge to the Christian belief in the Incarnation, or Jesus as God within a human body. The belief, Spinoza says, "that God, like a man, consists of body and mind, and is susceptible of passions," is "the height of absurdity."

The lack of emotion of Spinoza's God contrasts not only with Christian teachings about God's love, wrath, and mercy but also with the portrayal of those qualities in the Hebrew Scriptures. Statements like "Whom the Lord loves, He reproves" (Proverbs 3:12) make no sense if God is taken as having no feelings and no deliberate intent to reward or punish. Even less sensible, from Spinoza's point of view, is the rest of the verse, which likens God to a father rebuking "the son in whom he delights." Given how fundamentally Spinoza rejected the notion of God as a father figure demonstrating infinite benevolence, it is not surprising he ran afoul of both Christian and Jewish religious authorities, who deemed him a heretic.

For Spinoza, however, it made no sense to assert that a perfect God could choose to do, or not to do, anything. Wouldn't a perfect being, by definition, always be compelled to make the better "choice"? An "intellect" that makes no decisions and a "will" whose choices are predetermined are not an intellect and a will in anything like the ordinary sense of those words. Unsurprisingly, then, Spinoza construes God's intellect as anything but ordinary—certainly not as a super-powered version of a judging, inferring, deciding human mind. In its sheer impartiality, the mind of Spinoza's God is more akin to a vast computer in which the universe, with all its objects and people, constitutes an infinitely running program.

In Spinoza's time, the beliefs expressed in the _Ethics_ were often denounced as atheism. It would be more precise—and is now more common—to call them _pantheism_, the assertion that God and reality are the same thing. This God-as-nature view has implications for the understanding of nature as well as for the understanding of God. For Spinoza, God is the cause of all that is, but not because of any divine plan. Rather, all that exists flows directly and necessarily from God: this world is not the "best of all possible worlds," but the _only_ possible world. Once this idea is recognized, it quickly follows that anger and hatred are foolish and destructive emotions, for it makes no sense to hate a person for behavior that is, strictly speaking, inevitable. On the other hand, "acquiescence"—acknowledgment and acceptance of things as they are—becomes for Spinoza one of the cornerstones of wisdom.

## Emotions as a System

After Part 1, Spinoza gradually pivots to the discussion of human nature, with emotions the centerpiece of Parts 3–5. Human emotions, Spinoza asserts, can be traced to the fundamental triad of pleasure, pain, and desire. From these three, considered in relation to oneself and others under different life circumstances, the rich variety of emotions can be produced. Hatred and love, for example, are identified as types of desire that arise in response to pleasure (whose sources are loved) or pain (whose sources are hated). Even more fundamentally, Spinoza posits that all emotion reflects the fundamental human drive to continue living and experience existence as fully as possible. This premise creates some difficulties when Spinoza attempts to consider suicide and other forms of self-harming behavior.

From a quick perusal of Parts 3 and 4, Spinoza's ethics may seem similar to that of the Stoics. Both ethical systems are often misinterpreted as demanding that people extinguish emotion and live only by bloodless reason. This impression, however, would be an oversimplification. It is true Spinoza regards many emotions as destructive and stemming purely from ignorance—specifically, from an ill-informed and thus inaccurate attempt to seek one's own best interest. He even criticizes some emotions, such as compassion, that are often taken to be categorically positive. The Stoics likewise construct a system under which the commonsense view of various emotions is presented as radically mistaken. They claim that much of what people assign positive value to is actually indifferent. However, neither Spinoza nor the Stoics seek to do away with all emotions. On the contrary, both leave open the possibility that emotions can be in accord with reason and can motivate the same beneficial actions as reason does. Spinoza does not seem to think emotions _could_ be eliminated or suppressed altogether, even if it were wise to do so. For him, humans are like all other living things in that they are inevitably driven by forces beyond their conscious comprehension. According to both Spinoza and the Stoics, the hope of freedom lies not in fighting against emotions head-on but in learning to rationally recognize and accept the world as it is and direct emotional responses according to this rational recognition. Understanding why people feel and act as they do is a prerequisite for the "blessedness" Spinoza sees as the highest goal in life.

## The Geometric Method

The full Latin title of the _Ethics_ is _Ethica Ordine Geometrico Demonstrata_, which translates to "Ethics Demonstrated in a Geometric Way." True to its name, the _Ethics_ is organized according to the same kind of structure as one would normally see in a geometry textbook: axioms (fundamental principles) are laid out, and propositions (what today would be called theorems) are proved on the basis of those axioms. In direct imitation of mathematical style, Spinoza ends his proofs with the initials Q.E.D. (_quod erat demonstrandum_ or "that which was to be shown"). Each major section of the _Ethics_ is densely cross-referenced to those before it, with proofs building cumulatively and sometimes returning to propositions from dozens of pages earlier. Much of the material is presented twice: once in the order dictated by the logic of Spinoza's proofs, and then again in a more intuitive and reader-friendly order.

This axiom-proof-theorem approach, almost universal in modern mathematics, is sometimes called the "method of Euclid" after the famous Greek mathematician (c. 365–300 BCE) who used this approach in his _Elements_ (c. 300 BCE). Spinoza alludes to Euclid's work both directly and indirectly throughout the _Ethics_, not only as a model but also as an indication of how rigorous he considers his own reasoning. At multiple points in his text, Spinoza suggests that a proposition is as incontrovertible as some basic rule of geometry—for example, that a triangle's interior angles add up to 180 degrees or that all the points of a circle are the same distance from its center.

Nonetheless, it could be—and has been—argued that Spinoza's assertions do not have the same degree of rigor as mathematical proofs. Despite his extensive definitions and examples, terms like "desire" and "intellect" are simply more open-ended and less precise than "line" or "circle." Consequently, some mathematicians have taken issue with the claims Spinoza makes for his work: the famous logician Bertrand Russell (1872–1970), who admired Spinoza's moral philosophy, nonetheless found his assertions of "proof" to be doubtful or even ridiculous. Moreover, Spinoza's commitment to writing his book in this way sometimes leads him to present extensive proofs for assertions that seem like common sense, while letting other, more contentious statements pass with a brief note. Thus, even if the reader makes an effort to keep up with the numerous axioms and definitions, some of Spinoza's bolder claims about God and the mind may seem to come out of left field.

Ultimately, Spinoza's adoption of a mathematics-like structure does not make his deductions as airtight as results obtained in actual mathematics. Even so, his approach does have some clear benefits: the use of numbered axioms and propositions helps organize a work that would otherwise be extremely hard to follow. More broadly, the "Euclidean" structure of the work sheds light on the way Spinoza construed the universe: as a place of apparent complexity with a few simple rules at its heart. Spinoza repeatedly makes the point that seemingly complicated topics—God, the mind, human emotions, right and wrong—can be broken down in a systematic way.

#  Context

## The Enlightenment

[Baruch Spinoza](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ethics/author/)'s investigation of God and human nature took place in the early days of the Enlightenment, a Western intellectual movement of the late 17th through the 18th centuries. Leading Enlightenment thinkers developed a new political philosophy based on individual rights that took an increasingly skeptical approach to the tenets of revealed religion (religion based on divine revelation rather than reason). They held, as Spinoza did, that reason and logic were the keys to cultural progress and societal harmony.

Enlightenment thinkers were united in their interest in knowledge, freedom, and happiness, but they understood these concepts in different ways. Some believed the world was a blank slate for God, who had only good intentions for humanity. The idea of a benevolent God was most strongly adopted by German philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716), who championed the idea of philosophical optimism. He believed that everything that happens is God's will, so the world is the best of all possible worlds. Spinoza, Leibniz's senior by about a decade, believed that nature revealed no intention of an overarching goal or plan. The limitations of the human mind, he held, merely made it _seem_ that the natural world had been designed for humankind's benefit. In this way of thinking, he resembled the later French thinker Voltaire (1694–1778), who in his satire _Candide_ (1759) mocked Leibniz's optimism. Spinoza also defined _freedom_ somewhat more narrowly than his Enlightenment contemporaries, challenging French mathematician and philosopher René Descartes's (1596–1650) claims that one could achieve absolute self-mastery.

The Enlightenment was also a period of great scientific discovery, which often directly threatened theories of divine power. Scientists made leaps in human understanding of the solar system (namely that there were natural scientific laws governing it), and the discovery of certain fossils seemed to contradict the creation story of the Bible's Old Testament. Religious explanations for natural phenomena became less important to many scientists as the disparity between science and religion grew more apparent. Although Spinoza touches on the natural sciences only briefly in his _Ethics_, he adopts a naturalistic cause-and-effect paradigm for the universe in general, arguing that neither God nor humankind can ultimately act outside the confines of this framework.

## Rationalism and Empiricism

One of the major debates of early modern European philosophy concerned the origins of knowledge. The empiricists—best represented by British philosopher John Locke (1632–1704), Irish philosopher George Berkeley (1685–1753), and Scottish philosopher David Hume (1711–76)—held that all knowledge is derived from sense experience.

- Locke construed the human mind at birth as a _tabula rasa_, a "blank slate" on which knowledge was gradually impressed throughout life.
- Berkeley took the idea somewhat further, arguing that objects are nothing other than collections of sensations. He reasoned that because perception involves having an idea, an idea is a collection of sensations, and sensations are how one knows objects, it follows that what knowers perceive are only ideas. Thus, an object is the idea one has of it. A Granny Smith apple, for example, _is_ _just_ the collection of sensations one has: _this_ roundness, _this_ crunchiness, _this_ tartness.
- Hume, like his fellow empiricists, held that knowledge is derived exclusively from sensation—what he called "impressions." More specifically, he argued that if all knowledge is traced back to initial impressions, but a knower has an idea that can't be traced back, then that idea cannot be epistemologically justified or grounded in knowledge. Hume identified the idea of causation as the definitive case. Whenever one connects two objects or events as causally related, one is not rationally justified in claiming to _know_ these events to be so related. This justification cannot be made either by way of deductive reasoning (supporting or refuting a conclusion with data) or by way of inductive reasoning (drawing conclusions based on data). That's because the idea of causation cannot be traced back to an initial (sense) impression. The best that can be done is to recognize a kind of internal impression—a psychological propensity or habit—to associate objects and events in this way.

The major opponents to empiricism were the rationalists, whose ranks included Baruch Spinoza, as well as Descartes and Leibniz. They held that knowledge is fundamentally rational in nature, with no crossover into sense experience. Though geographically widespread, the predominantly Continental rationalists (those working in continental Europe) represent a close-knit intellectual lineage comparable to that of the mainly British empiricists. Late in life, Spinoza corresponded with Leibniz, who was ambivalent about the merits of Spinoza's ideas but shared his older colleague's enthusiasm for mathematical reasoning as a path to truth. From a much earlier age, Spinoza was also a careful reader and critic of the work of Descartes, devoting his first major treatise, _René Descartes's Principles of Philosophy_ (1663), to a presentation and analysis of Descartes's ideas.

As a rationalist, Spinoza shared Descartes's propensity for bold claims concerning what the human mind could know based on inhibition and introspection alone. Although his hierarchy of knowledge presented in the _Ethics_ leaves room for empirical observations, this "first kind" of knowledge is ranked lower in importance—and accuracy—than the rational and intuitive "kinds." Spinoza was less accepting of Descartes's other lines of argument—for example, the mind-body dualism that is now known as Cartesian dualism. In fact, Spinoza spends several paragraphs in the _Ethics_ lamenting Descartes's attempts to ground the dualistic view in features of human anatomy. His own view, as expounded in the _Ethics_, has been called _neutral monism_ because it posits a single underlying substance—"God, or nature"—from which both mind and matter proceed.

## Skepticism and Heresy in Early Modern Europe

When considering the writ of excommunication issued by Spinoza's synagogue, one might get the impression that a _heretic_ was something rare and dreadful in the mid-17th century. In reality, Spinoza was far from the only European thinker of his time to deny the existence of a personal deity, to question the accuracy of the Bible, or to challenge the belief in free will. For more than a century prior to Spinoza, Europe had been "haunted," to use contemporary Italian critic Gianluca Mori's (b. 1959) phrase, by the "specter" of atheism. Though not an atheist himself, Spinoza was pigeonholed as one by his many detractors. In the _Tractatus Theologico-Politicus_ (1670), Spinoza had explicitly denounced atheism, suggesting it should not fall within the scope of a state's religious tolerance, but this fact was ignored or conveniently forgotten by his opponents. Those who did grasp the distinction between Spinoza's pantheism (equation of God with nature) and true atheism were not inclined to set much store by the difference. Even Dutch theologian Christoph Wittich's (1625–87) _Anti-Spinoza_ (1690), a highly sophisticated point-by-point critique of the _Ethics_ by someone clearly versed in European philosophy, blithely writes Spinoza off as "godless."

Moreover, Spinoza came of age during the early days of what is now called biblical criticism—the practice of analyzing the Bible as a literary or historical text. His philosophy, as expounded in both the _Tractatus Theologico-Politicus_ (1670) and the _Ethics_ (1677), was influenced by (among others) French theologian Isaac La Peyrère (c. 1596–1676), whose _Prae-Adamitae_ (_Men Before Adam_, 1655) makes the claim its title would imply. La Peyrère's work, like Spinoza's _Tractatus_, weighs the evidence for and against the historical accuracy of the Bible from the Book of Genesis onward. Some of the questions La Peyrère raises are so glaring that, today, it may seem strange his book was ever considered controversial. For instance, if Eve is the "mother of all living," where did her son Cain find a wife? Widely read and discussed by scholars throughout Europe, _Prae-Adamitae_ provoked various denunciatory books and pamphlets, just as Spinoza's works would later do.

Formally, the "excommunication" pronounced by the Jewish authorities in Amsterdam is called _cherem_, a word translated more literally as "ban or boycott." Though Spinoza was not a Christian, Church authorities were also quick to pronounce his work heretical, inasmuch as it challenged the shared biblical foundations and theistic principles of both Judaism and Christianity. His _Tractatus Theologico-Politicus_ was placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum—the Catholic Church's official list of forbidden books—in 1679, and his posthumous works, the _Ethics_ by far the most important of these, were added in 1690. Both the _Tractatus_ and the _Ethics_ also were banned by the secular authorities in the Netherlands: the former for its expression of unorthodox political beliefs, the latter as a "profane and atheistic work." This program of suppression did little to prevent other philosophers and academics from obtaining copies of Spinoza's writings, but it did contribute to the popular mischaracterization of his work for decades after his death.

# Summary

## Summary

### Part 1: Concerning God

[Spinoza](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ethics/author/) begins by making some fundamental assertions about God. God, he says, is "absolutely infinite," "self-caused," and unconstrained by any outside forces. Nature, for Spinoza, is equivalent to God—a radical departure from the traditional monotheistic view of God ruling over, and distinct from, nature. God, or nature, is a single, infinite, indivisible substance, outside of which nothing can exist. The apparent variety and separateness of the observed universe comes from "modifications" of God's eternal attributes. Because he asserts that God ultimately causes all change and activity, Spinoza rejects free will as it is traditionally defined.

### Part 2: On the Nature and Origin of the Mind

Spinoza next considers the human mind, starting with the claim that thought is an attribute of God. Spinoza goes on to suggest that the human mind is an idea in the "infinite intellect of God" with no independent existence. The object of this idea—what the idea is "about"—is the human body. Spinoza next makes some fundamental, but dubious, claims about the physiology of the human body. For example, he construes consciousness as involving the physical "impression" of images on various parts within the body. Based on these claims, he sketches out various aspects of the mind-body relationship, such as memory and imagination.

The last major topics in [Part 2](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ethics/part-2-summary/) are knowledge, truth, and the will. Spinoza characterizes falsehood as a product of ignorance—an absence of knowledge—lacking any positive existence of its own. He describes a gradation of knowledge from the merely circumstantial to deep intuition and reiterates and expands his denial of classical free will. Part 2 closes with an explanation of why Spinoza's system of thought is useful, both for society and for the individual.

### Part 3: On the Origin and Nature of the Emotions

Emotions, Spinoza says, are "modifications of the body," combined with the idea of those modifications. That is, they have both a physical and a mental component. Moreover, the mind can be either active or passive in proportion to the adequacy of its ideas. Emotions themselves—love, for instance—can be considered either active or passive depending on the idea that motivates them.

Whether it acts or is acted upon, Spinoza states, the mind attempts to continue existing. This fundamental effort is the basis for pleasure, pain, and desire, which are responses to things that help or hinder the mind's "endeavor to persist." From these three, Spinoza describes dozens of other common emotions as special cases. For example, love is "pleasure accompanied by the idea of an external cause," and hope is an "uncertain pleasure" about an outcome that remains in doubt. Spinoza explains a wide range of human experience, such as jealousy, pride, compassion, and so forth, on the basis of this system.

### Part 4: Of Human Bondage, or the Strength of the Emotions

For Spinoza, bondage (captivity or servitude) is merely the extent to which a person is dominated by emotions. Good and evil, he explains, are subjective and situational: the same emotion may be good in one context but bad in another. Because humankind is part of nature, Spinoza asserts that bondage is the default state of things: an emotion can be "controlled or destroyed" only by another, stronger emotion. It follows that self-control stems not simply from knowledge of good and evil but from desires—that is, other emotions—founded on that knowledge.

Virtue, Spinoza suggests, is nothing more or less than seeking one's own best interest in line with the dictates of reason—in other words, enlightened self-interest. Social strife and discord result, not from people seeking their own interest but from people _mistakenly_ or _ignorantly_ seeking their own interest. Rational, virtuous people will, by definition, exist in harmony. Again, however, Spinoza doesn't mean that rational people lack emotion: rather, reason guides them to desire what is good and shun what is evil.

### Part 5: Of the Power of the Understanding, or of Human Freedom

Finally, Spinoza suggests how a person can transcend the bondage described in [Part 4](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ethics/part-4-summary/). Though still skeptical that humankind can be truly free, he suggests that a kind of freedom can be attained through self-awareness and reflection on one's emotions, even though emotions can never be completely eliminated or fully controlled. A wise person, Spinoza claims, will "acquiesce" to the world as it exists and not be perturbed by the world's failure to live up to irrational expectations. This acquiescence, combined with an ongoing search for knowledge, leads to a state Spinoza describes as "blessedness."

# Part 1 : Concerning God | Summary

Each of the five parts of the _Ethics_ is structured as a series of numbered axioms, proofs, and theorems, similar to the method used in geometry. Thus, Spinoza's thinking is organized and laid out for readers. Spinoza begins the parts by defining relevant terms and providing axioms, or statements given to be true. He then presents his propositions, or assertions, and supports them with logical reasoning.

## Key Takeaways

- Spinoza asserts that the universe consists of a single, infinite, indivisible "substance," which is equivalent to God. By substance, Spinoza means a basic entity (or type of entity) that makes up reality and acts as the base on which all identifiable attributes stand.
- God, he argues, consists of infinite attributes that are in turn "modified" to produce the objects and events of observed reality.
- Spinoza uses the term _attribute_ to mean the characteristics the intellect perceives as constituting the essence of substance.
- Spinoza uses the term _infinite_ to mean "unlimited by another thing of the same nature." He gives the example of an idea: because it can be replaced with another idea, it is limited. If it were the only possible idea and therefore irreplaceable, it would be unlimited.
- Apart from God, nothing "can be, or can be conceived."
- God is "free" in the sense of not being subject to any external constraints. Nonetheless, Spinoza contends, God "acts by the necessity of his nature."
- Consequently, God is not "free" in the sense of having chosen to make the universe in a particular way. The universe, as it exists, flows inevitably from God's nature.
- For God, uniquely, existence and essence are the same thing. According to Spinoza, existence means "being"—whether something is, or exists. Essence is the nature of a thing or substance, what makes it what it is. In other words, existence _is_ God's fundamental nature. Things produced by God (people, for instance), do not share this property.
- In the Appendix to Part 1, Spinoza criticizes as superstition the view that everything exists for the benefit of humankind. Nature, he maintains, "has no particular goal in view," and any appearance to the contrary comes from the imperfections of the human mind.
___
# Part 2 : On the Nature and Origin of the Mind | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- Reality and perfection, Spinoza proposes, are synonymous. The more real a thing is, the more perfect it is.
- God possesses both "thought" and "extension," or existence in physical space, though not in the same sense as a human being. God extends throughout the universe and is not constrained to a specific physical body.
- Things, including people, exist as ideas in the "infinite intellect of God." Specifically, the human mind is an idea in the mind of God, and the "object" of this idea is the human body. In other words, the mind is an idea about the body.
- Memory, imagination, abstraction, and other functions not related to immediate sensory input come from impressions left on the body by past stimuli. Spinoza takes these impressions to be literal, physiological changes of shape.
- The mind knows itself only indirectly and imperfectly, through the body. The mind's knowledge is also "very inadequate" when it comes to duration, whether of the body or of any external object.
- Falsehood, for Spinoza, is inevitably a product of ignorance or confusion. True ideas have a positive existence of their own, but false ideas do not.
- Knowledge can be divided into three kinds: that based on observation, that based on reasoning, and that based on direct intuition. Spinoza considers the third to be the highest and surest form of knowledge.
- Reason, by its nature, considers things under the "form of eternity" and as part of a necessary chain of events—not as transient, coincidental, or contingent.
- Free will as such does not exist: the mind is "determined to wish" for specific things by a chain of external causes. To Spinoza, it follows that "will and understanding are one and the same."
- Perhaps sensing the controversial nature of what he has proposed, Spinoza explains how his worldview benefits both the individual and society. Understanding everything as necessarily interrelated, he suggests, will diminish emotions of hatred and envy and prepare people to seek their own interests in a harmonious way.

# Part 3 : On the Origin and Nature of the Emotions | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- Spinoza criticizes the unsystematic way in which past philosophers have treated the emotions. He proposes to set matters straight by considering "human actions and desires in exactly the same manner as ... lines, planes, and solids."
- The mind is active, Spinoza suggests, insofar as it has adequate ideas, and it is passive insofar as its ideas are inadequate. A passive mind is more subject to be acted upon, whereas an active mind is less open to such influence. Spinoza returns to this idea in Part 5, where it will play a role in elaborating the relationship between knowledge and freedom.
- Next, Spinoza argues that the essence of a thing consists in its "endeavor ... to persist in its own being." The essence of a human mind, for instance, lies in the mind's endeavor to continue existing.
- From this drive toward self-preservation arise pleasure, pain, and desire. Pleasure arises from those things that "increase or help" the body's power, and hence the mind's effort at self-preservation. Pain arises from those things that hinder this effort. Desire is the emotional inclination toward the former things and away from the latter.
- On this basis, Spinoza then sketches out the origins and interrelationship of all human emotions. Hatred and love, for instance, follow directly from the desire to seek pleasure and avoid pain.
- Other seemingly more complex emotions are forms of love, hatred, pleasure, or pain in specific contexts and circumstances. Joy, for instance, is "pleasure arising from the image of something past" whose outcome was in doubt. Pity is "pain arising from another's hurt." Definitions of jealousy, revenge, pride, and dozens of others follow by similar reasoning.
- "All emotions," Spinoza reaffirms, "can be referred to desire, pleasure, or pain."
- Part 3 concludes with a concise restatement of the emotions and their definitions.
___
#  Part 4 : Of Human Bondage, or the Strength of the Emotions | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- Spinoza defines bondage—captivity or enslavement—as human weakness in controlling the influence of emotions. A man who is prey to his emotions cannot control himself and is therefore at the mercy of fortune.
- He suggests the lack of clarity surrounding emotions stems from a more general confusion about what makes something good or bad. The labels of "good" and "bad," "sin" and "merit," "justice" and "injustice" are all relative. A thing is good if it is useful in achieving one's goals, bad if it hinders those goals.
- As a part of nature, humankind is always "a prey to [its] passions." Moreover, an emotion can be overpowered only by another, stronger and contrary emotion. Neither knowledge nor reason by themselves can check the influence of emotions. People do not abide by reason alone.
- Desire resulting from pleasure is for the most part stronger than desire resulting from pain.
- Reason doesn't make demands contrary to nature. Basically, it requires that every person love themselves and seek what is useful to them—that is, what leads to greater perfection and self-preservation.
- Consequently, virtue—or action in accordance with the laws of one's nature—consists not in stifling emotions but in seeking to improve one's understanding. The more one knows, the more "adequate" one's ideas are, and the more active one becomes. Conversely, the less one knows, the less adequate one's ideas are, and the more passively prone to emotion one becomes.
- A life lived "in obedience to reason" benefits not only the individual but also society as a whole. Virtuous people want others to live virtuously, a desire that when realized is beneficial to everyone.
- Viewed in this light, Spinoza says, some emotions, such as hatred, are always bad. Others, such as honest self-approval, are always good. Many others, such as love and desire, vary in their effects according to context. Desire stemming from reason, however, "can never be excessive."
- For Spinoza, real freedom lies in submitting one's actions to the dictates of reason.

# Part 5 : Of the Power of the Understanding, or of Human Freedom | Summary

## Key Takeaways

In this last and shortest part of the _Ethics_, Spinoza expands on the idea of freedom—that is, freedom from control by emotions rather than by reason—sketched out at the end of Part 4.

- Spinoza asserts that the mind's power depends entirely on its degree of understanding, and not on the will.
- Because passions—emotions that render a person passive—arise only from imperfect ideas, forming a clear and distinct idea of an emotion renders it less powerful.
- To the extent that the mind understands all things as necessary—that is, not contingent, coincidental, or subject to chance—it gains greater power over all emotions.
- According to Spinoza, God is without passions. He is unaffected by pleasure or pain and thus neither loves nor hates anyone. He does, however, love himself with "an infinite intellectual love."
- Spinoza equates self-understanding, including understanding of one's own emotions, with the love of God. This imperishable, intellectual love of God is the highest good the human mind can seek or achieve.
- Returning to the reasoning of Part 2, Spinoza argues that because the human mind participates in the infinite intellect of God, "something" of the mind is eternal and survives the death of the body. It follows that the more perfect a mind's understanding becomes, the less that mind will fear death.
- Spinoza concedes that the kinds of virtue he discusses are difficult to practice. They run against the grain of popular belief, including that of revealed religion. Nonetheless, he encourages the reader to seek virtue—and thus freedom—with the parting thought that "all things excellent are as difficult as they are rare."

1.

> Whatsoever is, is in God, and without God nothing can be, or be conceived. 

Narrator, [Part 1](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ethics/part-1-summary/)

This proposition (Proposition 15) underscores how unusual Spinoza's view of God was for his time. Most Western monotheists—including the Christian and Jewish authorities who rejected Spinoza—held that God stood apart from the created universe and ruled over it. In Part 1 Spinoza suggests nearly the opposite: to him, God and nature are fundamentally the same thing.

2.

> Things could not have been brought into being by God in any manner or in any order different from that which has ... been obtained. 

Narrator, [Part 1](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ethics/part-1-summary/)

Though hardly the most memorably phrased part of the _Ethics_, this statement (Proposition 33) drives a further wedge between Spinoza's view of God and the mainstream view of his contemporaries. Here, in effect, Spinoza denies God has a will in anything like the sense ordinarily implied by the phrase "free will." All that exists, Spinoza asserts, flows necessarily from the nature of God without any choosing or weighing of possibilities.

3.

> The power of God is very often likened to the power of kings. 

Narrator, [Part 2](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ethics/part-2-summary/)

As Spinoza works to relate human nature to divine nature, he is careful to reiterate that God does not possess a will in the typical sense. That is, God cannot choose whether to act or not to act and could not have chosen to create the universe in any way other than the way it actually is. Thus, for Spinoza, it is foolish to compare God's power—which is fully actualized at all times—to that of a human king.

4.

> The human mind is part of the infinite intellect of God. 

Narrator, [Part 2](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ethics/part-2-summary/)

This corollary to Proposition 11 is the basis of much of Spinoza's reasoning about human nature, emotions, and immortality. He argues that the human mind is an idea with the human body as its object—that is, an idea "about" the body. Later in the _Ethics_, Spinoza uses this principle to make an inference about the immortality of the human mind because it exists as an idea in the infinite and eternal mind of God.

5.

> Everything, in so far as it is in itself, endeavors to persist in its own being. 

Narrator, [Part 3](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ethics/part-3-summary/)

For Spinoza, the essence of a thing—that which makes it what it is—is its drive toward self-preservation (Proposition 6). It follows that the essence of the human mind is the urge or effort to continue existing. Thus, the human mind loves whatever fosters its continued existence and hates whatever threatens it. On this foundation Spinoza builds the whole system of emotions described in Part 3.

6.

> We are naturally so constituted as to believe readily in that which we hope for, and with difficulty in that which we fear. 

Narrator, [Part 3](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ethics/part-3-summary/)

At the beginning of Part 3, Spinoza lays out a seemingly symmetrical system of emotions with pain on one side and pleasure on the other. Here (Proposition 50) and elsewhere, however, this symmetry breaks down because of the human tendency to seek pleasure and avoid pain. One consequence of this tendency is the mental effort to minimize negative thoughts, leading to what today would be called the "optimism bias."

7.

> Like waves of the sea driven by contrary winds we toss to and fro unwitting of the issue and of our fate. 

Narrator, [Part 3](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ethics/part-3-summary/)

One overarching goal of Part 3 is to show how thoroughly the human mind is influenced—even controlled—by external causes. This image, unusually lyrical for Spinoza, makes the point vividly. In Part 4 Spinoza proceeds to describe the "bondage" of the human mind to emotions; in Part 5 he hints at a way of obtaining freedom.

8.

> By good I mean that which we certainly know to be useful to us. 

Narrator, [Part 4](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ethics/part-4-summary/)

This definition—the first in Part 4—serves as the basis for Spinoza's ethics of relativism. In his view, nothing is intrinsically good or evil, sinful or virtuous, just or unjust. Rather, "good" and "evil" are to be judged relative to a person's goals; "justice" and "injustice" make sense only within the norms of a society.

9.

> The mind has greater power over the emotions and is less subject thereto, in so far as it understands all things as necessary. 

Narrator, [Part 5](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ethics/part-5-summary/)

Spinoza here suggests something similar to the Buddhist ideal of equanimity. In his view, a person who recognizes that everything flows necessarily from the nature of God will be less prone to react emotionally to people and events. It is easy, for instance, to hate a person when one believes the person's wrongdoing was freely chosen or could have been avoided. It is much harder to hate someone for an action taken out of necessity.

10.

> All things excellent are as difficult as they are rare. 

Narrator, [Part 5](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Ethics/part-5-summary/)

Throughout Part 5, Spinoza sets out an arduous set of recommendations for controlling one's emotions and rising to a state of greater intellectual perfection. He identifies this state with an "acquiescence" to all that is and a quieting of all violent passions. At the very end of the book, Spinoza concedes this kind of self-mastery is extremely challenging. The difficulty itself, he suggests, is a sign the endeavor is worthwhile.

# Glossary

**axiom:** _(n)_ statement taken to be self-evident and used as the basis of a further argument. Spinoza begins each part of the _Ethics_ by setting forth the axioms that form the foundation of his proofs.

**bondage:** _(n)_ literally, captivity or enslavement. Spinoza uses the term to denote the state of being overruled by one's emotions.

**corollary:** _(n)_ theorem that follows easily or immediately from another, earlier theorem. The _Ethics_ follows the traditional outline of a mathematical text by presenting a proof of a major theorem, then deducing various corollaries from it.

**essence:** _(n)_ fundamental nature of a thing or substance, that which makes a thing or substance what it is. Spinoza follows a long philosophical tradition in distinguishing essence from existence.

**existence:** _(n)_ state of existing, or being. Like many philosophers before and since, Spinoza draws a distinction between the existence of a thing (whether or not it exists) and its essence.

**lemma:** _(n)_ intermediate conclusion reached in the process of mathematical proof. Like the geometry texts he emulates, Spinoza uses lemmas to indicate "stepping stones" in his argumentative logic.

**pain:** _(n)_ as defined by Spinoza, "the transition of a man from a greater to a less perfection." Spinoza's definition of pain encompasses, but extends beyond, the familiar types of physical and emotional pain.

**passion:** _(n)_ emotion with respect to which an individual is passive. In Spinoza's treatment of the emotions (Part 3), the passions are involuntary responses to external stimuli.

**pleasure:** _(n)_ as defined by Spinoza, "the transition of a man from a less to a greater perfection." Spinoza treats pain and pleasure as the fundamental building blocks of all human emotions.

**postulate:** _(n)_ in modern mathematics, a synonym for axiom. Spinoza follows the practices of ancient geometric texts in regarding axioms as more fundamental than postulates.

**proposition:** _(n)_ another, formerly much more common, name for a theorem. Spinoza favored this term, and several of his translators have followed suit.

**Q.E.D.:** _(phrase)_ quod erat demonstrandum, Latin for "that which was to be shown." Mathematicians—and philosophers taking a mathematical approach—use this expression to signal the end of a proof.

**revealed religion:** _(phrase)_ religion in which the word of God or spiritual truths are revealed, or communicated, from the divine world to believers in the material world. Revelations usually come through prophets or others who give voice to God's words.

**substance:** _(n)_ basic entity (or type of entity) that makes up reality. Spinoza describes the universe as consisting of a single substance, meaning not that the universe is made of a single type of physical material but that it constitutes a unified whole without fundamentally disparate parts.

**theorem:** _(n)_ significant statement established as true via a proof. The main structure of the _Ethics_ is that of a series of axioms, theorems, and proofs.

# Biography

### Early Life

Baruch (Benedict de) Spinoza was born on November 24, 1632, in Amsterdam. His parents, Michael and Hannah, were among the Sephardic Jews (descended from Jews who lived in Spain and Portugal before expulsion) who fled to the Netherlands from Portugal to escape the terrors of the Inquisition (1478–1834). The Inquisition was a brutal religio-judicial process intended to fight heresy by promoting conversion to Christianity. Coming from a respected merchant-class family, Baruch—whose name in both Hebrew and Latin translates as "blessed"—attended the local Talmud Torah, a Jewish school combining elementary education with scripture study. On the basis of the intelligence of his first writings, he likely excelled in this environment. At age 17 he left school to help his father and brother in the family's import business.

### Excommunication

When he was about 20, Spinoza had become a teacher within his synagogue. However, tensions soon arose between the freethinking Spinoza, who by this point seemed to have doubted the accuracy of the Bible, and his orthodox neighbors. On July 27, 1656, two years after his father's death, Spinoza was charged with heresy and excommunicated from his Amsterdam synagogue, whose other members were barred from so much as speaking with him. The writ of excommunication read, in part, "The anger of the Lord ... shall smoke against that man ... all the curses ... written in this book shall lie upon him, and the Lord shall blot out his name from under heaven." The event that provoked this pronouncement remains unclear. Many points raised in the _Ethics_ and other works would have been deemed heretical by the standards of the day, but it is uncertain to what extent Spinoza's views on God, the soul, and revealed religion (religion based on divine revelation rather than reason) had developed in 1656. In any case, Spinoza remained in the city for some time, maintaining loose ties to the Jewish community there in spite of his formal shunning. Eventually, an assassination attempt prompted him to move to Rijnsburg, Netherlands, in 1661. There, he took up the trade of lens making and published his first major work and the only work published under his name during his lifetime: a critical treatise entitled _René Descartes's Principles of Philosophy_ (1663).

### Later Years, Death, and Legacy

After spending several years in Rijnsburg, Spinoza moved to The Hague, where his unorthodox ideas stirred up a mixture of controversy and admiration. A second major work, the _Tractatus Theologico-Politicus_, appeared in 1670 and was widely read and discussed. The _Tractatus_ is emphatic in its rejection of revealed religion and critical of those who try to make sense of the apparent inconsistencies of scripture. For Spinoza, the Bible is best regarded as a largely historical document with some important ethical lessons.

A final treatise, the _Ethics_, occupied Spinoza throughout the later years of his life. Though essentially complete by 1675, the work was not published until after Spinoza's death from lung disease (traditionally thought to be tuberculosis) on February 21, 1677. Perhaps the delay resulted from a desire to avoid further controversy. Early reception of the _Ethics_ was distorted by the charges of atheism attached to Spinoza throughout his life and for decades afterward—charges now viewed as oversimplification. Gradually, however, the work came to be regarded as Spinoza's masterpiece, and Spinoza himself assumed a place among the great Western philosophers.
