Pandora's box is an artifact in Greek mythology connected with the myth of Pandora in Hesiod's c. 700 B.C. poem Works and Days. Hesiod related that curiosity led her to open a container left in the care of her husband, thus releasing curses upon mankind. Later depictions of the story have been varied, with some literary and artistic treatments focusing more on the contents than on Pandora herself.

The container mentioned in the original account was actually a large storage jar, but the word was later mistranslated. In modern times an idiom has grown from the story meaning "Any source of great and unexpected troubles",[2] or alternatively "A present which seems valuable but which in reality is a curse".

The mistranslation of _pithos_ is usually attributed to the 16th-century humanist [Erasmus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasmus "Erasmus") who, in his Latin account of the story of Pandora, changed the Greek _pithos_ to _[pyxis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyxis_(vessel) "Pyxis (vessel)")_, meaning "box". The context in which the story appeared was Erasmus' collection of proverbs, the _[Adagia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adagia "Adagia")_ (1508), in illustration of the Latin saying _Malo accepto stultus sapit_ (from experiencing trouble a fool is made wise). In his version the box is opened by [Epimetheus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epimetheus_(mythology) "Epimetheus (mythology)"), whose name means 'Afterthought' – or as Hesiod comments, "he whom mistakes made wise.
