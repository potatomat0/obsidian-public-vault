_____
- **The myth of equality-efficiency tradeoff**: The author argues that there is no sound basis for believing that a more equal distribution of income would harm the efficiency of the economy. He cites empirical and theoretical evidence to support his claim.
- **The sources of economic inequality**: The author identifies three factors that contribute to the unequal allocation of wealth and income in society: inheritance, inborn physical attributes, and social value of labor. He gives examples of how these factors create inefficiencies and distort incentives.
- **The benefits of economic equality**: The author contends that a more egalitarian distribution of economic resources would be more efficient and beneficial for human welfare. He suggests that equality would enhance the provision of opportunities, increase the net impact of income gains, and reduce the downward spiral of misallocation.
