#  Main Ideas

## Lack of Concern for Truth

Noam Chomsky writes that "it is the responsibility of intellectuals to speak the truth and to expose lies." He contends that this may seem obvious but that an indifference to truth is actually spreading among intellectuals. Chomsky quotes the German philosopher Martin Heidegger (1889–1976) who defined truth as "the revelation of that which makes a people certain, clear, and strong." Chomsky suggests that Heidegger's conception of truth entails the justification of lying on consequentialist grounds. Consequentialism is a moral system that defines right action in terms of the overall good the action produces. Lies that promote the good of the majority can thus be seen as acceptable when actions are judged solely by their outcomes. Chomsky worries that redefining truth in the manner that Heidegger recommends divorces truth from the facts. He notes that "the facts are known to all who care to know." Chomsky defends a more rigorous scientific understanding of truth.

Chomsky asks what responsibility citizens bear for "the incredible sequence of lies on the part of our government and its spokesmen." Chomsky refers specifically to America's involvement in the Vietnam War (1954–75). Chomsky argues that much of the popular press coverage of the war aims at distorting the truth about America's reasons for sending troops to Vietnam. He alleges that certain intellectuals help to disguise "the unconstrained viciousness that the mass media present to us." Chomsky contends that "a real or feigned naiveté" among intellectuals produces misinformation regarding America's motives for engaging in the conflict in Vietnam. He cites American historian Arthur Schlesinger (1917–2017) as an example of an intellectual whose work depicts unjustifiable violence as "perfectly rational." Chomsky expresses his fears about the American "propaganda apparatus" that increasingly employs intellectuals to paint America's atrocities in a positive light. This technique serves to stifle and suppress any criticism of the government's policies and decisions and thereby runs counter to the aims of democracy.

## Rational and Irrational Forms of Protest

Chomsky points to a trend in the media of distinguishing the "responsible" critics of the war from the "hysterical" ones. He notes that "the 'hysterical' critics are to be identified, apparently, by their irrational refusal." The critics portrayed as hysterical share a refusal to accept that "the United States has the right to extend its power and control without limit." All other critics seem to simply accept the United States' right to extend power as though it were the "one fundamental political axiom." Chomsky explains that any critic who challenges this axiom is labeled "sentimental" or "emotional," and their opposition to the war is deemed "irrational." Those "responsible" critics who do not challenge the fundamental belief in the United States' right to unlimited power are the only critics taken seriously. Chomsky casts doubt on the legitimacy of labeling as "hysterical" those who challenge the United States's right to extend power.

Chomsky examines the American writer Irving Kristol's (1920–2009) analysis of Vietnam protests that appeared in the magazine _Encounter_ in 1965. Kristol distinguishes between "responsible critics" and the "teach-in movement" born on university campuses in 1965. Kristol accuses "university protesters" of claiming to know "what the Vietnamese people really want" and of simply delivering "harangues on 'the power structure.'" Kristol presents the protests of "psychologists, mathematicians, chemists, or philosophers" as irrational. Chomsky asks whether it is fair for Kristol to simply assume "the purity of American motives." Chomsky wonders why anyone should accept Kristol's claim that policy decisions should "be left to 'experts' with Washington contacts." Chomsky points out the absurdity in Kristol's suggestion that intellectuals without political expertise can't properly draw conclusions about American foreign policy decisions. He suggests that intellectuals such as Kristol demonize university protests and brand them "irrational" to stifle America's anti-war sentiments.

## The "Scholar-Expert" and the "Free-Floating Intellectual"  

Chomsky alleges that "the scholar-expert replaces the 'free-floating intellectual" in American sociologist Daniel Bell's (1919–2011) _The End of Ideology_ (1960). Chomsky writes that Bell's discussion of ideology "is as important for what it leaves unsaid as for its actual content." Bell's central contention is that "ideology is dead" and that there is a "general agreement that each issue must be settled on its own terms." Ideology is associated with what Chomsky calls the "free-floating intellectual" who creates ideas as a means of improving social and political conditions. Ideology depends on a system of related ideas that create a framework through which to analyze social and political conditions. Bell views "free-floating intellectuals" with suspicion because he deems their task irrelevant. He alleges that scholars with specific technical expertise "in the conduct of public affairs'' have replaced intellectuals wishing to advance ideological causes.

Chomsky claims that Bell's discussion of ideology hinges on Bell's understanding of ideology as "the conversion of ideas into social levers." Bell declares ideology dead because he can find no evidence that scholar-experts have a desire to use ideas "for the radical transformation of society." He argues that significant modifications in "our way of life" are unnecessary in "the pluralistic society of the Welfare State." The "Welfare State" is a nation whose government concerns itself with caring for the needs of its citizens. Bell contends that the urge to resist the government or to change it in any fundamental way disappears in Welfare States. Chomsky challenges Bell's conclusion by noting that "it seems fairly obvious that the classical problems are very much with us." Chomsky casts a shadow of doubt on Bell's claim that an "intellectual consensus" confirms the death of ideology.

# Context

## Vietnam War

The Vietnam War (1954–75) involved a conflict between the communist government of North Vietnam and the government of South Vietnam. The South Vietnamese government opposed communism, which is a political and economic system in which the government owns or the entire community shares ownership of all land, machinery, and factories, and all wealth derived from them is expected to be shared equally amongst the people. The United States allied with the South Vietnamese government and sent troops to Vietnam to provide military support to fight the North beginning in 1965. The United States had an interest in preventing the expansion of the communist doctrines of the Soviet Union and China. U.S. involvement in Vietnam was thus considered a means to a larger political end of slowing the spread of communism across the globe.

Opposition to the war in Vietnam grew rapidly throughout the United States. Some of the most vocal opponents of the war were university students and faculty members whose protests gained widespread media coverage. The larger protests were quelled when the government enlisted the help of the National Guard to put an end to the protests. Four students were shot and killed by the Guard during a protest against the war at Kent State University in Ohio in 1970. The shooting caused the entire nation to reel in opposition to the United States' involvement in Vietnam. Student protests turned into a nationwide strike aimed at forcing the United States government to end U.S. involvement in Vietnam. By the end of 1973, the United States had officially withdrawn from Vietnam and had terminated its military campaign in the region.

## McCarthyism and the Red Scare  

The threat of Communist infiltration of America's governmental affairs loomed large in the 1950s. U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy (1908–57) alleged government interference by communists seeking to abolish America's liberties. McCarthy held a series of investigations from 1952–54 aimed at finding U.S. government officials with secret communist inclinations. The fear of communism grew in America during these years in part because of the communist takeover in China. The activities of communists in the Soviet Union also threatened the security that Americans enjoyed in accumulating personal wealth and property. Many Americans feared that a communist takeover would result in the reallocation of wealth and property in the United States. The reallocation of wealth was at odds with the widespread belief in a meritocracy in which hard work earns money as its reward.

War broke out in Korea in 1950 when the communist-backed North Koreans invaded the Republic of Korea in the South. The United States sent military support to help the South Koreans ward off the communist threat. By 1951, the North had retreated, but the United States maintained its military presence in the region in the hope of achieving a unification of Korea. Conflicts with communist forces spread to Taiwan and French Indochina. America responded by bolstering its military presence in the region and quadrupling its defense spending. Fears of communism reached epic proportions in America during this "Red Scare" and pitted Americans against communists waving their red flags.

## Marxism  

German philosopher Karl Marx (1818–83) outlined his political ideas in _The Communist Manifesto_ (1848). Marx's theories combined his views about historical progress with his ideas regarding the division of wealth within society. His central contention was that eventually the working people would grow tired of laboring excessively and receiving little compensation in exchange. Marx predicted that working people would eventually rise up against business owners and demand an equal share of wealth. Marx believed that a widespread revolution would upset the power structure and lead to a future world free of exploitation and oppression.

Marx's writings grew in popularity in the early 20th century in Russia. Revolutionary leaders saw in Marx's philosophy a vision for the elimination of all inequalities. They advocated for improving the living conditions of the working poor by redistributing material wealth. Marxists desired the elimination of the differences that produced divisions within their communities. They increasingly attempted to turn Marx's political and economic ideas into systems of government. The Russian Revolution of 1917 led to the revolutionary seizure of property held by private citizens to force a just redistribution. Eventually Russian leaders such as the Russian dictator Joseph Stalin (1878–1953) worked to expand their revolutionary vision by instituting Marxist regimes in other nations. Stalin's expansionist policies prompted western democratic countries such as the United States to react with force to oppose the spread of Marxist ideas.

# Summary

## Summary

### Responding to War

[Noam Chomsky](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Responsibility-of-Intellectuals/key-figure-analysis/#Noam_Chomsky) attributes his motivation for writing "The Responsibility of Intellectuals" to American writer Dwight Macdonald (1906–82). [Chomsky](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Responsibility-of-Intellectuals/author/) first read Macdonald's articles in the magazine _Politics_ (1945–46) in the aftermath of the widespread death and destruction of World War II (1939–45). Chomsky explains that Macdonald's articles "have lost none of their power or persuasiveness." Macdonald's concerns about "war guilt" and people's responsibilities with respect to the decisions of their governments remain important and relevant today.

Chomsky contends that "intellectuals are in a position to expose the lies of governments" and to analyze government decisions. He argues that intellectuals ought to provide critical analyses of policy decisions. Intellectuals enjoy more political liberty and better access to information than average citizens. Chomsky suggests that intellectuals consider "to what extent the American people bear responsibility" for the United States' involvement in the Vietnam War (1954–75). Chomsky calls the American military response in Vietnam a "savage American assault on a largely helpless rural population." He contends that most intellectuals simply "stood by in silence and apathy" while the government sanctioned the killing of civilians in Vietnam. Chomsky urges intellectuals to reconsider the privileged position that they hold and the responsibility to "speak the truth" that comes along with that position.

### The Importance of Context  

Chomsky argues that much of the popular press's coverage of the Vietnam War fails to communicate the historical context surrounding the war. Chomsky sees intellectuals as experts on understanding the historical circumstances that inform policy decisions made at the international level. He insinuates that important historical facts are intentionally omitted from media coverage of the war so as to influence the public's perception. The result is a "real or feigned naiveté about American actions that reaches startling proportions." Chomsky contends that the apologists defending American aggression act as if policy makers have pure and selfless motives. They pretend to have no knowledge of the more malignant forces in political history. They instead speak of the Chinese "menace" that threatens American security. This idea helps to ingratiate the public to the policy decisions that aggressively advance America's interests in dominating other nations.

### Demonizing Anti-War Protests  

Chomsky highlights the increasingly popular distinction between so-called "responsible" policy makers and the "university protesters." This distinction appears in publications that cover the Vietnam War such as _The New York Times_ and _Encounter_ magazine. The reports portray policy makers offering minor critiques about the United States's strategy in Vietnam (1954–75) as rational and competent. Policy experts accuse university protesters of baselessly claiming to know "what the Vietnamese people really want." They allege that the protestors' assumptions about the Vietnamese are made on the basis of emotion and are thus unfounded. The university protesters are depicted as immature and reactionary, and their demand that the war end is deemed "irrelevant." The policy makers' perspectives are promoted as fully informed by political expertise and experience. The press thus touts the expert opinion as the only legitimate perspective and insinuates that the university protesters can't understand international affairs. Chomsky asks whether it seems reasonable to insist that the experts alone "command the necessary knowledge" to criticize policy decisions. He defends intellectuals as equally capable of interpreting complex information and of analyzing the various strategies that government leaders must consider.

### Analyzing Ideologies  

Chomsky writes that "when we consider the responsibility of intellectuals, our basic concern must be their role in the creation and analysis of ideology." An ideology is a system of ideas that informs political theories and policies. Chomsky discusses the American sociologist Daniel Bell's (1919–2011) essay "The End of Ideology" (1960), which calls ideology "a mask for class interest." Bell argues that intellectuals no longer see any need to employ ideology to achieve social change. He thus concludes that "ideology is dead." Chomsky offers a critical assessment of Bell's conclusion and contends that it is proof that "the classical problems are very much with us." He mentions "the paradox of poverty" in particular. He notes that poverty is confusing in that it continues to rise even though global wealth is growing exponentially. Chomsky calls Bell's attitude "utopian" because it frames the communists' opposition to privatization as merely an obstacle to "building democratic institutions." Chomsky contends that worries about the growth of "democratic institutions" reflect the unique anxieties of elite Americans. People in third-world or underdeveloped countries are forced to worry more about their survival than about the success of their institutions.

Chomsky warns that "elite" bureaucrats could undermine revolutionary movements that aim at establishing "true democratic institutions" across the globe. He concludes by cautioning against "accepting society" as it is. Chomsky encourages intellectuals to stay engaged in political discussions and to refuse to simply reinforce the harmful norms pedaled by government misinformation campaigns. Intellectuals have a responsibility to openly address the dehumanizing and demoralizing attitudes shaping policy decisions in Vietnam. Chomsky warns that failing to fulfill this responsibility amounts to a silent consent to government-sponsored atrocities.

## Analysis

### The Intellectual's Position

Noam Chomsky describes his sense that American writer Dwight Macdonald's (1906–82) political articles in the magazine _Politics_ (1945–46) maintain their "power" even twenty years later. Chomsky summarizes the specific evidence Macdonald introduces in investigating what responsibility citizens bear in the face of government-sponsored atrocities. Chomsky notes that Macdonald's investigation is important for "anyone whose political and moral consciousness had been formed by the horrors of the 1930s." Chomsky alludes to his own struggle as a student to come to terms with some of the worst atrocities he was learning about.

Chomsky contends that intellectuals "are in a position to expose the lies of governments, to analyze actions according to their causes." Chomsky's argument is founded on a distinction between the general public and the "intellectual" whose livelihood involves critical thinking. The intellectual is accustomed to research and to cultivating their own ideas about the world. The general public generally must rely on mass media for their news and information. Chomsky explains that intellectuals "have the power that comes from political liberty, from access to information and freedom of expression." Chomsky defines power in political terms and argues that intellectuals have more power than ordinary citizens. This power differential results in a difference in responsibilities for intellectuals. Ordinary people are not in a position to critically evaluate government policies, but intellectuals are. Chomsky clarifies that the privilege of holding a position as an intellectual comes with a unique set of responsibilities. He aims to articulate those responsibilities by applying his ideas to an analysis of the United States government's actions.

### Lies and Misinformation  

Chomsky writes that "it is the responsibility of intellectuals to speak the truth and to expose lies." He launches an investigation of what he sees as a government misinformation campaign. Chomsky describes how the American historian Arthur Schlesinger (1917–2017) admitted to lying to _The New York Times_ reporters in 1965. Schlesinger had lied about the American Central Intelligence Agency's plan to attack Cuba to fight communism during the Bay of Pigs invasion (1961). Chomsky points out that Schlesinger's published account of his knowledge of the United States government's strategy in Cuba contradicted his statement to the press. Schlesinger later explained that his lie was in "the national interest." Chomsky expresses his surprise about the lack of reaction Shlesinger's confession of lying garnered. Chomsky contends that "it is significant that such events provoke so little response in the intellectual community."

Chomsky addresses "the power of the government's propaganda apparatus" to stifle important information about questionable governmental affairs and policies. Chomsky was writing in 1967 during the Vietnam War (1954–75) in which the United States was fighting the communist regime in North Vietnam. Chomsky alleges that "the deceit and distortion surrounding the American invasion of Vietnam is by now so familiar that it has lost its power to shock." Chomsky claims that Schlesinger's comments to _The New York Times_ in 1966 depicted the bombing of North Vietnam in 1965 as "perfectly rational." Chomsky notes that Schlesinger's assessment of the bombing demonstrates his contempt for the silent audience that will simply accept his perspective as authoritative. Chomsky thus reveals that he disagrees with Schlesigner's analysis. He views the bombing of North Vietnam as an unjustifiable act of aggression. He challenges intellectuals to correct lies and misinformation campaigns that he thinks leverage support for the unjustified use of force.

Chomsky argues that there is a "real or feigned naiveté about American actions." He thus insinuates that the unwillingness of media reports to question American motives is intentionally disguised as ignorance. Chomsky points to Schlesinger's claim that American involvement in Vietnam is "part of our general program of international goodwill." Chomsky expresses his outrage by asking whether this remark reveals "a colossal cynicism" or just an inability "to comprehend elementary phenomena of contemporary history." Chomsky suggests that the former rather than the latter is the case. He writes that "it surpasses belief" that anyone could endorse such blatantly inappropriate statements. Chomsky makes it clear that he sees Schlesinger's comments as propaganda that intentionally distorts the truth about America's aggression in Asia.

### Missing Evidence  

Chomsky quotes the American economist Walt Rostow's (1916–2003) book _An American Policy in Asia_ (1955). Rostow writes that Americans "are openly threatened and we feel menaced by Communist China." Chomsky sarcastically comments that "to prove that we are menaced is of course unnecessary." He contends that the fact that we "feel" menaced has become the basis for justifying the aggressive American military campaign in Vietnam. He makes it clear that he finds rational justification for the war and evidence of an actual threat to be lacking. Rostow does little more than allege that America needs to "counter an 'ideological threat.'" Chomsky casts doubt on the reality of this threat. He instead suggests that Asians pose no threat and offers an alternative hypothesis. He describes Asians as concerned with "preserving the 'dignity of the individual' against concentrations of foreign or domestic capital." Chomsky alleges that Vietnam's resistance to American control is what has prompted America to invade Vietnam. Chomsky calls Rostow's discussion of a Chinese threat little more than another contribution to "this sorry picture." He singles Rostow out as a propagandizing government ally who has failed to fulfill the duties associated with his role as a public intellectual.

Chomsky examines additional sources of what he considers to be propaganda aimed at increasing public support for war. Chomsky writes about the "pseudo-scientific posing" of the American intellectual and strategist Herman Kahn (1922–83). Kahn's book _On Thermonuclear War_ (1960) compares traditional warfare with nuclear war. Chomsky makes it clear that he finds Kahn's book lacking in substance. He calls it "one of the emptiest works of our time." Chomsky alleges that Kahn "proposes no theories, no explanations, no factual assumptions that can be tested." Chomsky insinuates that any positive reception for Kahn's book is the result of its attempt at justifying aggressive military campaigns. Kahn's position as a social scientist gives Chomsky a reason to wonder whether or not social science deserves to be called "science." He demonstrates that Kahn offers little more than propaganda for the war machine in the form of his own "expert" opinions. The fact that Kahn provides no evidence to support his claims serves as further proof for Chomsky's allegations. Chomsky calls the work of social scientists like Kahn "absurdities." He makes it clear that he views Kahn's book as yet another intellectual tool for garnering public support of government-sponsored violence.

# Quotes

1.

 >Intellectuals are in a position to expose the lies. 

[Noam Chomsky](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Responsibility-of-Intellectuals/key-figures/#Noam_Chomsky)

Chomsky's central contention is that intellectuals have a responsibility to expose lies and to reveal truth. Intellectuals enjoy political freedoms and have advantages that attend to the positions they hold at universities. They are a "privileged minority" with the leisure time and the training "to seek the truth lying behind the veil of distortion and misrepresentation." Intellectuals should therefore shoulder more of the burden for holding the government accountable and directing its aims.

2.

> One man is quite happy to lie. 

[Noam Chomsky](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Responsibility-of-Intellectuals/key-figures/#Noam_Chomsky)

Arthur Schlesinger (1917–2017) was a historian and public official who admitted to deceiving _New York Times_ reporters covering a story about America's attempt to invade Cuba. He later explained that he had lied intentionally about America's Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba (1961) to protect "the national interest." Chomsky notes that the term "the national interest" is "defined by the group of arrogant and deluded men" who aspire to increase American dominance and control. Chomsky finds it outrageous that intellectuals remained silent in the face of Schlesinger's confession.

3.

> Duplicity is considered perfectly in order. 

[Noam Chomsky](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Responsibility-of-Intellectuals/key-figures/#Noam_Chomsky)

Chomsky maintains that "the deceit and distortion surrounding the American invasion of Vietnam" is increasingly becoming the new normal. He contends that misinformation campaigns in the popular press that aim to increase public support for the Vietnam War (1954–75) no longer shock anyone. He argues that the result is widespread cynicism and a loss of trust in the government and its institutions.

4.

> It surpasses belief. 

[Noam Chomsky](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Responsibility-of-Intellectuals/key-figures/#Noam_Chomsky)

Chomsky alleges that the lies surrounding America's interests in Vietnam are scarcely believable. The historian Arthur Schlesinger (1917–2017) called America's aggressive policies a "program of international goodwill." Chomsky maintains that the lies should be evaluated "from a more historical point of view." He points to parallel instances where "hypocritical moralism" leads to the conclusion that America's motives are pure and thus beyond the scope of rational critique.

5.

> Innocence becomes increasingly distasteful. 

[Noam Chomsky](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Responsibility-of-Intellectuals/key-figures/#Noam_Chomsky)

Chomsky writes about the "failure of skepticism" to direct its gaze at America's reasons for getting involved in the Vietnam War (1954–75). Chomsky notes that there is pressure to accept the idea that "America's motives are pure" on faith alone without any evidence in support of it. Chomsky argues that this innocence regarding America's self-interested motives becomes dangerous "as the power it serves grows more dominant in world affairs." He contends that intellectuals have a responsibility to expose the "self-righteousness that disfigures our intellectual history." This responsibility is an ethical one that arises from their unique position within society.

6.

> Is the purity of American motives ... beyond discussion? 

[Noam Chomsky](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Responsibility-of-Intellectuals/key-figures/#Noam_Chomsky)

Chomsky poses a rhetorical question to draw attention to the lack of critical analysis surrounding America's involvement in the Vietnam War (1954–75). He finds it shocking that intellectuals are not speaking out against the obvious lies and misinformation in the popular press's coverage of the war. Chomsky argues that America's "will to power" in Asia should be obvious to intellectuals who specialize in critical thinking. Chomsky finds it unreasonable that Americans are expected to simply accept that American motives are noble and good. He wants to inspire a dialogue that aims at establishing the truth as to why America is waging a war in Vietnam.

7.

> Is 'expertise' applicable? 

[Noam Chomsky](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Responsibility-of-Intellectuals/key-figures/#Noam_Chomsky)

Chomsky wonders to what extent political "expertise" ought to be seen as important in evaluating foreign policy decisions. He asks rhetorically whether there is "a body of theory and of relevant information, not in the public domain, that can be applied." He notes that popular political commentators such as the American writer Irving Kristol (1920–2009) "presupposes answers, answers which are wrong in all cases." Chomsky contends that intellectuals possess sufficient critical thinking skills to adequately evaluate policy decisions and that they thus have a responsibility to do so.

8.

> There are wild men in the wings. 

[McGeorge Bundy](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Responsibility-of-Intellectuals/key-figures/#McGeorge_Bundy)

American foreign policy expert McGeorge Bundy (1919–96) argues that the Vietnam War (1954–75) "turns on tactics, not fundamentals." Chomsky maintains Bundy's claim that "there are wild men in the wings" aims at offering a justification for the unrestrained use of violence in Vietnam. Chomsky looks skeptically at this allegation and notes that it runs counter to the truth. It attempts to place blame on the Vietnamese people for the "tens of thousands of tons of bombs" America is dropping on Vietnam.

9.

> They have felt our power directly. 

[David N. Rowe](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Responsibility-of-Intellectuals/key-figures/#David_N._Rowe)

Chomsky analyzes Yale University Professor David N. Rowe's (1905–85) suggestion that "the United States buy all surplus Canadian and Australian wheat." Rowe argues that this will cause "mass starvation in China" and create political instability there. Rowe alleges that the Asian nations would marvel at America's imposition of political power as a result. Chomsky expresses his shock and outrage at Rowe's inhumane proposal. Chomsky poses the rhetorical question, "why restrict ourselves to such indirect means as mass starvation?"

10.

> Their protest must be irrational. 

[Noam Chomsky](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Responsibility-of-Intellectuals/key-figures/#Noam_Chomsky)

Chomsky describes American writer Irving Kristol's (1920–2009) analysis of protests against the Vietnam War (1954–75). Kristol's discussion appeared in the magazine _Encounter_ in 1965 and involved a distinction between "responsible" critics of United States foreign policy and university critics who oppose the war. Chomsky alleges that those who analyze war strategies without casting doubt on the United States's right to extend power are called "responsible." University protests are depicted as irresponsible because they challenge the idea that the United States has the right to be involved in Vietnam's politics. Kristol accuses university critics of the war of claiming to know "what the Vietnamese people really want." Chomsky maintains that Kristol portrays university students and faculty as "emotional" and "irrational" to stifle their criticism and to silence their protests.

11.

> This is all nonsense. 

[Noam Chomsky](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Responsibility-of-Intellectuals/key-figures/#Noam_Chomsky)

Chomsky writes about American war strategist Herman Kahn's (1922–83) book _On Thermonuclear War_ (1960). Kahn's book compares traditional forms of warfare with nuclear war. Chomsky calls Kahn's book "one of the emptiest works of our time." Chomsky alleges that Kahn "proposes no theories, no explanations, no factual assumptions that can be tested." Chomsky concludes that Kahn's book is intended to bolster American support for the Vietnam War (1954–75). Chomsky deems Kahn's claims to be "nonsense" because Kahn offers no valid arguments in support of the war.

12.

> The cult of experts is both self-serving ... and fraudulent. 

[Noam Chomsky](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Responsibility-of-Intellectuals/key-figures/#Noam_Chomsky)

Chomsky points out some of the "confusions" that plague the "anti-war movement." Chomsky is actively involved in protesting the war, but he nevertheless acknowledges the problems that he sees within the movement. He expresses disdain for the tendency of the protest movement to divide itself into two "expert" camps. Experts on values are allegedly able to "provide fundamental insights on moral perspectives," and social scientists contribute "empirically validated propositions." Chomsky finds it "ridiculous" to consider social science and value theory as essential for analyzing America's role in the Vietnam War (1954–75). He sees these pursuits as "pseudoscientific" because they fail to produce any verifiable evidence that could substantiate their claims.

> Ideology is dead. 

[Daniel Bell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Responsibility-of-Intellectuals/key-figures/#Daniel_Bell)

Chomsky analyzes Daniel Bell's (1919–2011) _The End of Ideology_ (1960). Bell claims that ideology is pointless in a "Welfare State" that concerns itself with the care of its citizens. Chomsky notes that Bell defines ideology in terms of "social leverage." Bell argues he has found no evidence to support the view that people want any kind of systemic overhaul or radical changes. Chomsky thinks that Bell has simply overlooked the evidence that shows how "classical problems" continue to confront America. He cites the problem of the growth of poverty as an example to demonstrate that Bell's conclusion is incorrect.

> The United States has a wide range of options. 

[Noam Chomsky](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Responsibility-of-Intellectuals/key-figures/#Noam_Chomsky)

Chomsky points to the obvious economic differences between industrialized nations and developing nations. He notes that discussions about the spread of democratic institutions are "directed more to American intellectuals than to third-world ideologists." These discussions undergird support for the Vietnam War (1954–75). Chomsky alleges that developing nations face "insurmountable problems" that do not plague the wealthier and more technologically advanced nations. Chomsky suggests that American intellectuals concerned for the citizens in developing nations have a duty to work to improve global social and economic conditions.

> Our power placed us above the rest. 

[Winston Churchill](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Responsibility-of-Intellectuals/key-figures/#Winston_Churchill)

British Prime Minister Winston Churchill (1874–1965) explains to the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin (1878–1953) that power belongs to those "dwelling at peace." He warns that people who are starved for power "would always be a danger" to the rest of the world. Chomsky applies this line of reasoning to analyze America's actions in the Vietnam War (1954–75). He suggests that America's self-interest and thirst for power poses a threat to the rest of the world.

#  Biography

#### Early Life and Education

Noam Chomsky was born on December 28, 1928, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His work in linguistics first earned acclaim after he pioneered a theory of innate grammar known as essentialism. Essentialism holds that the structures of grammar are built into the brain and that grammar is not acquired like vocabulary.

Chomsky earned a Ph.D. in linguistics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1955. He accepted a teaching position at the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) the following year in 1956. His book _Syntactic Structures_ (1957) discussed linguistic grammar and served as the springboard for the launch of a graduate program in linguistics at MIT. Chomsky's publication of _Aspects of the Theory of Syntax_ (1965) and _Cartesian Linguistics_ (1966) helped to increase his popularity among scholars of linguistics across the globe.

#### Principles and Parameters  

Chomsky introduced a framework for understanding his essentialist ideas about grammatical structures in _Lectures on Government and Binding_ (1981) and _Knowledge of Language_ (1986)_._ Chomsky asserted that there are universal linguistic features shared by all minds that include both "principles and parameters." Principles govern the general structure of language learning, and parameters contribute to variations within particular instances of learning. Chomsky also articulated a detailed account of the system he called "universal grammar." He argued that universal grammar was at the root of all language learning. By the 1990s, his ideas about the complex structure of language gradually evolved into a more streamlined theory of language acquisition.

#### Politics  

Chomsky's political involvement began in 1964 when he publicly opposed the Vietnam War (1954–75), which involved the fight over communism in North Vietnam. Chomsky critiqued the United States' involvement in Vietnam and shared his opposition to the war in the magazine _The New York Review of Books_. His article "The Responsibility of Intellectuals" (1967) accused prominent scholars and politicians of lying to the public to garner support for the war. Chomsky maintained that the United States was using aggression in Vietnam to advance its interests in increasing its control in Asia. He argued that intellectuals and scholars have a duty to clearly communicate political facts to ordinary citizens. He viewed intellectuals as uniquely positioned to challenge misconceptions and to correct political misunderstandings. Chomsky's work continues to be relevant in an age in which widespread misinformation campaigns plague social media and other alternative sources of news and information.

#### Retirement and Later Years  

Chomsky earned a full professorship at MIT in 1961. He retired as an emeritus professor in 2002. Chomsky continues to engage in political discussions and frequently speaks out against corporate power and income inequality in America. He is a popular proponent of progressive political action to empower ordinary Americans. His book _Requiem for the American Dream: The Ten Principles of Concentration of Wealth and Power_ (2017) details the rise and fall of the big banks. _Climate Crisis and the Global Green New Deal_ (2020) advocates for dramatic measures that may slow the rate of global climate change.
