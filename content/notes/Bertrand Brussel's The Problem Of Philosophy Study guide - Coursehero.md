### Genre

Philosophy

### At a Glance

In _The Problems of Philosophy_ British logician and philosopher Bertrand Russell (1872–1970) takes the reader on a brief tour of the questions that have puzzled and fascinated Western thinkers for millennia. Fundamental problems of appearance and reality, and knowledge and error form the heart of the book. As Russell walks the reader through the most influential theories of being and knowing, he presents the reasoning of his predecessors in an appreciative yet critical light. He is impressed with the questions they have posed, yet he is never entirely convinced by the answers they have given. Ultimately, he concludes, much of philosophy's value lies not in its power to establish positive truths but in its tendency to broaden the horizons of the human mind. His survey offers readers a thorough, approachable, and brief introduction to philosophical endeavor.

### About the Title

In this short work, _The Problems of Philosophy,_ British logician and philosopher Bertrand Russell (1872–1970) guides the reader through some fundamental problems addressed (though not necessarily solved) by philosophers through the ages. His tour, which begins with the ancient Greeks and ends in the early 20th century, considers such specific problems as the nature of reality and the extent to which human knowledge can ever encompass truth.

# Main Ideas

## Limits of Common Sense

_The Problems of Philosophy_ begins by challenging commonsense assumptions about the relationship between appearance and reality, and then proceeds to show the deficiencies of equally commonsense notions about truth, falsehood, and knowledge. An object as simple and mundane as a writing table, Bertrand Russell argues, cannot truly be said to have a "real" color or texture merely on the basis of what one person's senses report. Much of what is called knowledge, he further asserts, is really just "probable opinion" undergirded by varying degrees of confidence. Thus, though perfectly adequate for navigating everyday life, common sense proves a dubious ally when precision is demanded. Seemingly obvious assertions about the world are often impossible to prove, while conjectures that clash with common sense may be equally impossible to _disprove_. "It is difficult to know," Russell observes, "that even the strangest hypotheses may not be true."

One fundamental problem Russell identifies with common sense is that it changes as cultural assumptions change: what was "obvious" to an educated person in 1650 may be considered debatable today, and what seemed absurd then may be "obvious" now. In the Europe of René Descartes's and Gottfried Leibniz's times, for instance, many considered it settled fact that the God of the Bible existed and possessed the attributes ascribed to him: omnipotence, omniscience, and benevolence. The cultural influence of Christianity was essentially unchallenged, and open dissent from Judeo-Christian beliefs could be costly or even dangerous, as Benedict de Spinoza found out. In this cultural climate it was easy to offer theories asserting the existence of God and difficult, both practically and philosophically, to challenge them. Thus, unsurprisingly, many principles that were in fact theological came to be assumed as if they were neutral philosophical maxims, independent of any special belief system. Leibniz's assertion that objects consist of souls, like Bishop Berkeley's assertion that objects exist in the mind of God, owes as much to the Abrahamic tradition as it does to the principles of logic. Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are known as the Abrahamic religions because they view the prophet Abraham as a common forefather.

In the era of Immanuel Kant, likewise, mathematics had not yet come to grips with the concept of infinite sets—partly because set theory as such did not exist. Kant, as Russell points out, took it for granted that there could be no collection with infinitely many members—and on the basis of this essentially mathematical premise, he proceeded to infer the impossibility of space and time. By the late 19th century, largely through the work of German mathematician Georg Cantor (1845–1918), set theory had emerged as a bona fide mathematical discipline—and with it a sophisticated characterization of infinite sets and their behavior. In a pre-Cantor world arguments could be won by appealing to the mathematical impossibility of infinity, but Cantor's contemporaries, including Russell, were naturally less swayed by such a line of reasoning. Nonetheless, Russell himself—though careful—was not immune from casual appeals to common sense. It was easy for him to posit, for example, that space and time are infinitely divisible, because at the time of writing (1911) the application of quantum theory to time and distance intervals was not widely understood.

## Measured Skepticism

The shortcomings of common sense, as portrayed by Russell, are severe—so severe that they may seem to support the view that nothing can be known at all. In one sense, Russell concedes this point: nothing, apart from immediate sensations and feelings, can be "known" in the sense of being self-evidently perceived without further inference or justification. Unless some principles of reasoning (themselves a form of knowledge) are accepted as axiomatic, no judgment of facts can be made. The true skeptic might even question the rules of logic, without which it is impossible to establish that two and two equal four ... or even that two equals two.

Yet, as Russell remarks, such absolute skepticism is self-defeating or at least self-limiting. From it no meaningful philosophy—or mathematics or science—can proceed: "if we adopt the attitude of the complete skeptic ... we are demanding what is impossible."

Instead, Russell proposes something like the "systematic doubt" practiced by Descartes: a peeling away of prejudices and preconceptions through careful scrutiny. As a "criticism of knowledge," he says, philosophy should aim to "consider each piece of apparent knowledge ... and retain whatever still appears to be knowledge when this consideration is completed." It should, in other words, not set out to dismantle knowledge but to consolidate it, sifting out the truly fundamental beliefs on which any system of thought must ultimately rest.

## Important Questions, Elusive Answers

Early on, Russell makes the point that philosophy, unlike the physical sciences, has been able to answer very few of the questions it has posed. He is deeply skeptical of philosophers who claim to have proved such things as the existence of God, the impossibility of evil, or the unreality of physical matter using purely philosophical reasoning. _The Problems of Philosophy_ is filled with examples of bold philosophical assertions that, as centuries passed, were shown up as lacking support—or as subtly embodying the prejudices of their time and place. Philosophy's reach appears, to Russell, inevitably to exceed its grasp.

An early instance of a dubious "ultimate answer" comes from Bishop Berkeley, who is introduced in Chapter 1. Berkeley claimed to have proved that the external physical world does not exist as such: all objects exist solely as ideas. In his system, which Russell describes in some detail before rejecting it, the apparent consistency of the world came from the ideas' presence in the eternal mind of God. An apple tree, for instance, continued to exist when nobody was around because God continued to hold it in his mind. Even in seemingly less controversial matters, Russell sees little reason to trust entirely to the conclusions of his predecessors. Assessing Descartes's axiom "I think, therefore I am," Russell notes that the famous phrase "says rather more than is strictly certain," since the real self—the "I"—is hard to characterize precisely. This pattern of doubt recurs throughout the entire roll call of famous philosophers quoted in _Problems_: David Hume's skepticism about human knowledge is described as too extreme, and Kant's central assertions concerning _a priori_ knowledge are shown to be unproven.

Throughout this work, however, Russell is careful not to ridicule even the grandest-claimed achievements of past philosophers. Instead, he emphasizes the difficulty of achieving positive knowledge through philosophical speculation. Even more importantly, Russell defends the assertion that philosophy can still have value—great value—despite its failure to provide conclusive answers. The entire last chapter of _The Problems of Philosophy_ is devoted to this premise; in it Russell argues that philosophy should be valued because it broadens the human mind, fosters an attitude of curiosity and equanimity about the world, and ultimately attunes people to how much they do _not_ know. These "goods of the mind," Russell maintains, may not be as immediately useful as a new medicine or metallurgical technique, but they are part of what both individuals and societies need in order to flourish.

# Context

## Rationalism

_The Problems of Philosophy_ is at its core a text about epistemology: the philosophical study of knowledge. In pursuing his concern with the nature and limits of knowledge, [Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Problems-of-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Bertrand_Russell) (1872–1970) draws on a centuries-old debate between two camps of philosophers, the rationalists and the empiricists. The rationalists, as [Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Problems-of-Philosophy/author/) briefly explains, hold that some kinds of knowledge are independent of sensory experiences. Early rationalists are sometimes known as _nativists_ because of their position that such knowledge is _innate_ or present at birth. The term _innate_, however, is problematic, as Russell points out, and can lead to the impression that babies are born knowing the rules of mathematics and logic. Although some nativists historically have attempted to defend that position, nonempirical knowledge is sometimes described using the more flexible term _a priori_ ("from the previous"), which Russell employs in _The Problems of Philosophy_.

In its early years modern rationalism was primarily a Continental (that is, European, excluding the British Isles) school of thought. It is most prominently represented by French philosopher René Descartes (1596–1650) along with the German thinker Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716). Both these men, along with their followers, held that knowledge is fundamentally rational in nature, with no crossover into sense experience. This premise allowed them to construct metaphysical arguments (those related to the nature of reality), for example, for the existence of God. Descartes held that the certainty of his own existence as a thinking being ("I think, therefore I am"), combined with the guarantee that God exists and would not deceive him about the correctness of his judgments, allowed him to infer the reality of a world outside his ideas. Leibniz followed and refined Descartes's ideas. The effort to prove God's existence serves as the cornerstone of his metaphysics. Russell, though himself not religious, is more interested in examining the theory of knowledge supplied by Descartes and Leibniz than he is in disputing their theological premises.

## Empiricism

Empiricists, on the other hand, hold that all knowledge is derived from sense experience. Russell names three major exponents of empiricism in _The Problems of Philosophy_: Irish philosopher Bishop George Berkeley (1685–1753), English philosopher John Locke (1632–1704), and Scottish philosopher David Hume (1711–76). Known as the British empiricists, these philosophers rejected the idea of innate knowledge as proposed by Descartes and refined by Leibniz. In its place they offered various theories to explain how even seemingly axiomatic (self-evident) knowledge—like mathematical and logical principles—arises from experience.

Locke, an English philosopher best known for his _Essay Concerning Human Understanding_ (1689), famously argued that the human mind is like a blank slate (_tabula rasa_) on which knowledge is engraved by experience. Although Locke's work is considered the foundation of modern empiricism, Russell in _Problems_ spends more time on the writings of Berkeley and on the seemingly strange conclusions he reaches. This Anglican cleric is best known for advancing the argument that objects are nothing other than collections of sensations. In a line of reasoning that Russell examines in [Chapter 1](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Problems-of-Philosophy/chapter-1-summary/) and critiques in [Chapter 4](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Problems-of-Philosophy/chapter-4-summary/), Berkeley determined that since perception involves having an idea, an idea is a collection of sensations, and sensations are how one knows objects, it follows that what knowers perceive are only ideas. Thus, an object is the idea one has of it. By eliminating an idea as a sort of mediator between perceiver and object, which Locke had done, Berkeley eliminates skepticism about whether a knower's idea really corresponds to, or represents, its object. A Granny Smith apple _is only_ the collection of sensations a person has of it: _this_ roundness, _this_ smoothness, _this_ greenness, _this_ crunchiness, _this_ tartness. There is no perception of an object _independently_ of these sensations. The ultimate conclusion of Berkeley's idealism is that there is no world at all apart from one's (and God's) ideas of it.

Hume, like his fellow empiricists, held that knowledge is derived exclusively from sensation—what he called "impressions." However, what follows from this drives a skeptical wedge between knower and claims of knowledge about how the world works. More specifically, Hume argued that, if all knowledge is traced back to initial impressions but a knower has an idea that can't be traced back, then that idea cannot be epistemologically justified. Hume identified the idea of causation as the typical case. Whenever one connects two objects or events as causally related, one is not rationally justified in claiming to _know_ these events to be so related. This justification cannot be made either by deductive reasoning (supporting or refuting a conclusion with data) or by inductive reasoning (drawing conclusions based on data). That's because the idea of causation cannot be traced back to an initial (sense) impression. The best that can be done is to recognize a kind of internal impression—a psychological propensity or habit—to associate objects and events in this way. In other words, causal connections are assumed to be, or expected to be, part of the fabric of experience because they are continuously experienced together. Indeed, this assumption is just part of how experiential reasoning works: the idea of causation makes it possible, for example, for one to make predictions or to draw an inference to the past. Here again, a major gap between knower and known appears.

Russell does not deny that inferences of causation—like many other types of commonsense inferences—are impossible to prove, strictly speaking. He observes, however, that the explanations proposed by the empiricists are often more complicated, and no more plausible, than a world in which objects persist and effects follow from causes. His prime examples of this are Berkeley's "it's all in the mind" hypothesis and the related notion, "what if it's all a dream?" Neither one, he points out, offers a more demonstrably accurate characterization of the world of sensations, and each relies on assumptions that are even more complicated than belief in a real world.

## Spinoza and Kant

The latter chapters of _The Problems of Philosophy_ touch on the views of other European philosophers whose works extended the empiricism/rationalism debate. Dutch-Jewish philosopher Benedict de Spinoza (1632–77), whose _Ethics_ (1677) Russell refers to in [Chapter 9](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Problems-of-Philosophy/chapter-9-summary/) and recommends as further reading, was another major member of the rationalist camp. He attempted to use mathematics to resolve the problems with Descartes's metaphysics—in particular, those stemming from Descartes's mind-body dualism. In the process Spinoza equated nature with God and got himself into trouble with both the Jewish and Christian authorities in his home city of Amsterdam. Spinoza ends up with a form of rationalism tinged with mysticism when he concludes that humans do not have a privileged perspective and no more dignity than anything else in nature. Humans must come to love everything, meaning loving God, which he equates with knowledge of God. German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) objected to Spinoza's mysticism and belief in God. For Russell, Spinoza is important as—among other things—a proponent of philosophical _monism_: the belief that only one thing exists (the universe) and any attempt to divide it into distinct objects is artificial.

Considerably more time is spent on the work of German philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724–1804), who sought to rescue the philosophy of rationalism from David Hume's radical empiricism and its assertion that all human knowledge is based on sensory experience. Hume claimed that all propositions are arrived at either analytically (by analyzing, or breaking down, more complex propositions) or synthetically (by putting together premises to reach a conclusion that is not merely the sum of its parts). He concluded that _a priori_ knowledge is purely analytic. Kant modified these ideas, arriving at the notion that there can be such a thing as _a priori_ synthetic knowledge, or matters of fact (rather than mere definitions) that are known based on intuitive knowledge—such as knowledge of space and time. Russell cites further examples of synthetic _a priori_ knowledge in the realm of mathematics, where the assertion "5 + 7 = 12" embodies a truth that is not strictly reducible to the meanings of _five_, _seven,_ or _plus_. Although he proceeds to dispute Kant's conclusions regarding the origins and nature of _a priori_ knowledge, Russell duly recognizes Kant as one of the most influential philosophers of the modern age.

# Summary

## Summary

### Appearance and Reality

_The Problems of Philosophy_ begins by examining the relationship between appearance and reality—and the difficulty of distinguishing the two. Commonsense ideas about what is "real" are critiqued as unprovable—though, [Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Problems-of-Philosophy/key-figure-analysis/#Bertrand_Russell) suggests, not necessarily unreasonable. "Sense-data," pieces of information received directly through the senses, are shown to be an unreliable basis for establishing the existence of a real object. Ultimately, [Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Problems-of-Philosophy/author/) proposes, belief in an independent physical reality is _instinctive_. Such instinctive beliefs, he later observes, form the necessary basis of any philosophical system, since no reasoning can be done without rules or premises. Moreover, some types of sensory information seem to be more reliable than others.

Faced with the impossibility of proving that an external physical world exists, some philosophers, called _idealists_, have maintained instead that all of reality consists of minds and ideas. Russell devotes a chapter to picking apart the main arguments advanced by the idealists. He concludes that idealism as a system is more complicated, but no more provable, than the commonsense assumption that real physical objects exist.

### Knowledge of Truths, Knowledge of Things

The next few chapters pivot from the question of what exists to the equally broad question of what can be known. Russell distinguishes _knowledge of things_ from _knowledge of truths_ and then proceeds to describe several ways—direct and indirect—by which things can be known. In addition to direct _acquaintance_ with a thing through one's senses, knowledge can be obtained through _memory_ or _introspection_. Still less directly, things can be known by _description_, as when someone is referred to by a title or personal characteristic. "Every proposition which we can understand," Russell argues, "must be composed wholly of constituents with which we are acquainted."

Returning to the subject of intuitive beliefs, Russell describes the principle of induction, by which generalizations are made from specific examples. Neither provable nor disprovable, it is nonetheless "unhesitatingly believed," as are such other principles as the law of contradiction ("Nothing can both be and not be") and the law of the excluded middle ("Everything must either be or not be"). Russell groups these principles, along with the rules of mathematics and certain value judgments, under the heading of _a priori judgments_. This leads to a discussion of _universals_—those categories, qualities, and other concepts that organize human thought but do not, strictly speaking, exist in their own right.

### Knowledge, Error, and Opinion

In explaining how universals are inferred from particulars, Russell is led back to the commonsense notion that "everything that we believe ought to be capable of proof." In general, he says, this is a fair attitude to adopt. However, in tracing the justifications of any belief—the "reasons for the reason"—there comes a point at which self-evident principles must be invoked. This leads to the problem of error, since a belief can be taken as self-evident even though it proves to be false. After offering an examination of knowledge, as contrasted with mere "probable opinion" and with error, Russell devotes a penultimate chapter to the limits of philosophical knowledge. Here and in a brief final chapter, he reflects on the value of philosophy, which he suggests lies in the questions it poses rather than the answers it provides.
___
#  Chapter 1 : Appearance and Reality | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- Bertrand Russell begins his book with a question: "Is there any knowledge in the world which is so certain that no reasonable man could doubt it?" This question, he says, is much harder to answer than it might seem.
- To show why his question is challenging, Russell offers a description of the writing table in his study. From his point of view, the table has a particular color and texture and makes a particular sound when struck with the hand. Yet a different person, sitting or standing in a different place, might acquire different "sense-data" from the same table. Likewise, the table might appear different under different light or when viewed with a microscope.
- This raises the issue of the table's "real" color, shape, and so forth. Given the inconsistency of the information provided by the senses, what kind of object can the "real" table be said to be?
- Philosophers of the 17th and 18th centuries, Russell points out, recognized the problem of relating real objects to their sensory appearances. Bishop Berkeley proposed that physical objects are actually ideas in the mind of God. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz suggested that objects consist of groups of souls.
- Though skeptical of Berkeley's and Leibniz's conclusions, Russell cautions that when it comes to the nature of reality, "it is difficult to know that even the strangest hypotheses may not be true." Perhaps, indeed, there is no table at all.
___
# Chapter 2 : The Existence of Matter | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- Pursuing his topic nonetheless, Bertrand Russell asks whether matter of any kind—not just tables—exists at all. "It may be," he suggests, "that the whole outer world is nothing but a dream." Though such a hypothesis cannot be disproved, Russell sees no reason to accept it either.
- In considering the relationship between thought and matter, Russell invokes René Descartes, who famously declared, "I think, therefore I am." He describes Descartes's method of systematic doubt, whereby every belief that _can_ be doubted is systematically called into question.
- The most certain forms of knowledge, Russell suggests, are sense-data. Any inference on the basis of those data—e.g., "there is an actual, physical table in front of me"—is bound to be less certain than the data themselves.
- There are, Russell points out, many circumstantial reasons to believe that real physical objects exist independent of the sense-data they provoke. Different people may see the table differently, but the differences are predictable and often very slight.
- It is reasonable to suppose that real physical objects exist, Russell proposes, but not because such a supposition can be proved. Rather, the hypothesis of an external physical world ends up being _simpler_ than any of the rival hypotheses ("Everything is a dream"; "Everything consists of ideas in the mind of God") advanced by the idealists.
- "All knowledge," Russell generalizes, "must be built up upon our instinctive beliefs, and if these are rejected, nothing is left." It follows that one of philosophy's major tasks is to scrutinize and organize these beliefs, ensuring that they do not contradict each other.
___
# Chapter 3 : The Nature of Matter | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- If matter does exist independently of sense-data, Bertrand Russell asks, what else can be said about it?
- In modern times the effort to answer these questions—to specify the nature of matter—has been led by physical science. Yet the answers provided by physical science often have little connection to the subjective experience of matter. The wave theory of light, for instance, offers an explanation that is far removed from the visual _sensation_ of light.
- This raises the broader question of just what kinds of information sense-data can provide. Russell suggests that sense-data give accurate impressions of the relations between distances (e.g., this object is closer than that one) but not of distances themselves; of the _order_ of events in time but not of the duration.
- In general, Russell finds, the relations between physical objects are more "knowable" than the objects themselves. It is tempting to assume that an object has, for instance, a "real" color independent of the different perspectives from which it is observed. Such an assumption, Russell asserts, is "groundless."
___
# Chapter 4 : Idealism | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- Bertrand Russell now examines in greater detail the arguments of the idealists: those philosophers, briefly mentioned in Chapter 1, who hold all that exists to be "in some sense mental."
- This theory, he argues, should not be dismissed as "obviously absurd" simply because it clashes with common sense. After all, common sense itself does not offer any clues to "the true intrinsic nature of physical objects."
- Some of the main arguments of idealism, Russell says, have stood the test of time and are regarded as valid. He cites as an example Bishop Berkeley's argument that sense-data exist "in" the mind, having no existence independent of the person doing the seeing or hearing.
- Other arguments, however, Russell finds false. The trouble arises, he says, when Berkeley and others jump from the premise that everything consists of ideas to the conclusion that everything is in the mind. "To argue that [a] tree itself must be in our minds," Russell suggests, "is like arguing that a person whom we bear in mind is himself in our minds."
- The confusion vanishes, Russell suggests, if one recognizes that many things said to be "_in_ the mind" are really "_before_ the mind," i.e., apprehended by the mind. Making this distinction robs Berkeley's arguments of much of their weight.
- Russell then evaluates a related claim: "we cannot know that anything exists which we do not know." This assertion, he argues, is much like Berkeley's in that it depends on the conflation of different meanings of the same word. In particular, to "know" can mean to correctly judge something to be true (Russell calls this _knowledge of truths_) or to be directly familiar with something through sense-data (_knowledge of things_).
- Disentangling these two types of knowledge and clarifying their relationship will be the major task of the next several chapters.
___
# Chapter 5 : Knowledge by Acquaintance and Knowledge by Description | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- Bertrand Russell now offers a more detailed distinction between _knowledge of things_ and _knowledge of truths_. He notes that things can be known by _acquaintance_ (direct sensory experience), by _description_, and in some cases by _memory_ or _introspection_.
- All knowledge, Russell claims, both of things and of truths, "rests upon acquaintance as its foundation."
- In addition to acquaintance with specific things that exist (_particulars_), knowledge by acquaintance extends to _universals_: general ideas like _whiteness_ and _brotherhood_.
- In the second half of the chapter Russell further develops the idea of knowledge by description—the only kind of knowledge, he says, by which physical objects or the minds of others can be known.
- Descriptions can be _ambiguous_ or _definite_; Russell offers "a man" as an example of the former and "the man with the iron mask" as an instance of the latter. An object is said to be "known by description" when there exists just one object answering to a definite description.
- Knowledge by description, Russell proceeds to assert, can ultimately be reduced to knowledge by acquaintance. That is, "every proposition which we can understand must be composed wholly of constituents with which we are acquainted."
___
# Chapter 6 : On Induction | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- In this chapter Bertrand Russell proceeds to ask how inferences are built up from the very limited range of things that are known by acquaintance (i.e., from knowledge of sense-data, memory, and possibly the self).
- He identifies the principle of _induction_ as a main way in which such inferences are constructed. According to this principle, an observed uniformity in past experience justifies an expectation about the future. Because the sun has risen every day so far, people expect it to continue to do so.
- Russell offers a rephrasing of the principle in somewhat more technical language. He says that if A and B have always been found to be associated, then as the number of observed cases of association increases, "the probability of a fresh association" will "approach certainty without limit."
- Although induction plays a fundamental part in shaping people's beliefs and governing their daily behavior, the principle cannot be strictly proven or disproven. It is, Russell says, "a belief which experience can neither confirm nor confute."
___
# Chapter 7 : On Our Knowledge of General Principles | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- Bertrand Russell proceeds to set forth several other principles "which cannot be proved or disproved by experience," but which seem central to philosophical argument.
- These include the so-called laws of thought: "whatever is, is" (the law of identity), "nothing can both be and not be" (the law of contradiction), and "everything must either be or not be" (the law of the excluded middle).
- The origin of these seemingly self-evident principles was, Russell says, historically a matter of great concern to two competing groups of philosophers: the empiricists and the rationalists.
- The empiricists held that all knowledge, including that of basic reasoning principles, came from experience; the rationalists held that some truths were innately known.
- The term _innate_, Russell explains, can be problematic, giving the "absurd" impression that babies are born knowing how to reason logically. For this reason modern philosophers prefer the term _a priori_ ("from the previous") for knowledge and judgments not deduced from experience.
- The principles of pure mathematics, as well as of logic, are _a priori_.
- Recognition of _a priori_ principles can sometimes be provoked by a concrete example; for instance, a general truth about triangles can be understood by considering a particular triangle.
- Nonetheless, _a priori_ knowledge is not _induced_ from empirical examples. People do not, for instance, judge it more likely that 2 + 2 = 4 as they encounter more and more examples of two pairs of objects adding up to four. Rather, they deduce, with total confidence, that the principle applies to any two pairs of objects.
- This raises, for Russell, another question: "How is it possible that there should be such knowledge?"

# Chapter 8 : How A Priori Knowledge Is Possible | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- To discuss the sources of _a priori_ knowledge, Bertrand Russell first introduces Immanuel Kant, regarded as "the greatest of the modern philosophers." One of Kant's major contributions was his observation that _a priori_ knowledge is not entirely _analytic_.
- _Analytic_ knowledge, in Kant's sense, is obtained by taking pieces of a complex proposition and breaking it down, i.e., analyzing it. Russell offers an example: "A bald man is a man."
- Prior to Kant, it had been held that _a priori_ knowledge was all analytic, which imposed a severe limitation on its usefulness. Kant maintained that some types of _synthetic_ knowledge—knowledge obtained by putting together premises to reach a new conclusion—was also _a priori_. He drew his major examples from mathematics.
- Kant asked, as Russell now does, "How is pure mathematics possible?" How, in other words, can general knowledge come about when all experiences are necessarily particular?
- In his answer Kant construed _a priori_ knowledge as a property of human nature, not so much describing experience as filtering it.
- Russell finds this explanation unsatisfactory, because _a priori_ judgments are assertions of unchanging, universal truths, and human nature (as part of the existing world) is prone to change.
- Revisiting some major examples of _a priori_ knowledge—the "laws of thought" described in Chapter 7—Russell finds that all such knowledge "is concerned with entities which do not, properly speaking, _exist_."
- These entities, which include qualities ("The sky is blue") and relations ("I am in my room") are known as _universals_. Understanding the "world" of such entities is Russell's next task.
___
# Chapter 9 : The World of Universals | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- Bertrand Russell offers a further definition and explanation of _universals_, which include such abstract qualities as _justice_, as well as concrete ones like _whiteness_.
- The problem of how universals relate to the real world was, Russell says, first raised by Plato, who came up with the idea of an "unchangeable world of ideas" in which the physical world "participates."
- By their nature universals are shared among _particulars_: many individual objects can be described as white, many individual acts can be called just, and so forth.
- Grammatically, universals are represented by numerous different parts of speech, whereas particulars are generally only indicated by nouns and pronouns. As a consequence, any well-formed sentence includes some references to universals.
- This is closely related to an earlier observation: "all truths involve universals, and all knowledge of truths involves acquaintance with universals."
- Historically, Russell says, philosophers have often neglected the great variety of universals, frequently ignoring the type of universal known as a relation.
- Because their systems did not account for the idea of relations between things, early modern philosophers were sometimes drawn into the assertion that only one thing (the universe) exists, called _monism_, or that none of the separate things in the universe can interact (_monadism_).
- Others, including several famous empiricists, argued that there are no such things as universals, or "abstract ideas."
- Universals, Russell goes on to demonstrate, are neither purely physical nor purely mental. Edinburgh is north of London whether an individual knows it or not, so the relation is not a mental one. Yet the relation "north of" does not exist by itself in a specific place and time.
- Russell proposes a distinction between _existence_, the kind of being that physical objects and minds have, and _subsistence_, the kind of being that universals have. To _exist_ is to be in time; to _subsist_ is to be timeless.
___
# Chapter 10 : On Our Knowledge of Universals | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- Knowledge of universals, Bertrand Russell asserts, is of the same basic kind as knowledge of particulars. That is, universals can be known by acquaintance, by description, or by neither.
- Qualities like _loud_ or _sweet_, as well as relations like _to the left of_ or _after_, can be known by acquaintance. Even relations _between_ relations—e.g., these objects resemble each other more closely than those do—can be known in this manner.
- The recognition of a "world of universals" helps, Russell says, with the problem of _a priori_ knowledge. "All _a priori_ knowledge," he proposes, "deals exclusively with the relations of universals."
- Russell elaborates and briefly justifies this new claim using the example of "2 + 2 = 4." He remarks that this is not a statement about any _particular_ grouping of two and two but one that holds in general.
- Such knowledge, he emphasizes, is not the same as an empirical generalization. That is, "2 + 2 = 4" does not rest on the same kind of knowledge as "all men are mortal."
- Nonetheless, an empirical generalization can sometimes prompt the search for a universal relation, as often happens in mathematics. On the other hand, _a priori_ knowledge can exist even when no particular examples are known—again, a common occurrence in mathematics.
- Near the end of the chapter Russell stops to lay out the different types and sources of knowledge discussed so far: knowledge of _things_ versus knowledge of _truths_, knowledge by _acquaintance_ versus by _description_, and _intuitive_ versus _derivative_ knowledge.
___
# Chapter 11 : On Intuitive Knowledge | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- The characterization of knowledge in the previous chapters leaves the problem of _error_, which Bertrand Russell proposes to deal with by first examining the basis of intuitive knowledge.
- It is commonly believed, Russell observes, that beliefs ought to be provable or at least justifiable in some way. Yet in seeking a "reason for the reason"—in asking "why" repeatedly—one eventually reaches a point where a belief is taken to be self-evident. This can be a basic logical rule, a mathematical axiom, or even (arguably) an ethical principle.
- Knowledge "immediately derived" from the senses can also be self-evident: "that patch of red is round," "this is to the right of that." Intuitive judgments of memory are also self-evident. Because of its fallibility, however, memory really possesses "degrees of self-evidence," with the most vivid and most recent memories at the top of the scale.
___
# Chapter 12 : Truth and Falsehood | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- Returning to the problem of error, Bertrand Russell poses the question: "What do we _mean_ by truth and falsehood?" The goal here, he emphasizes, is not to determine which beliefs are true and which are false but what the terms "truth" and "falsehood" themselves mean.
- Russell enumerates three criteria that a "theory of truth" should have: it should 1) include the idea of falsehood, 2) recognize that truth and falsehood are properties of beliefs, and 3) acknowledge that the truth or falsehood of a belief has a basis in the external world.
- Most philosophers attempting to provide a theory of truth have, Russell says, hit upon the idea "that truth consists in ... correspondence between belief and fact."
- Some have said, more precisely, that "truth consists in _coherence_," but Russell does not accept this formulation. He points out that a system of beliefs may well be coherent yet false, like an elaborate alternate history crafted by an imaginative novelist.
- Russell advances a different theory in which a belief is true if there is a "complex unity" (a _fact_, for short) corresponding to the objects and relations involved in the belief. For example, Othello's belief that "Desdemona loves Cassio" is true if there is such a complex unity as "Desdemona's love for Cassio."
___
# Chapter 13 : Knowledge, Error, and Probable Opinion | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- Building on the definition of truth given in the previous chapter, Bertrand Russell asks what it means to _know_ that something is true.
- Knowledge, he argues, cannot be simplified to mere "true belief." A person can believe something that happens to be true without having justification for the belief.
- Instead, to constitute knowledge, a belief must be inferred from premises that are already known, with intuitive knowledge serving as the bedrock of such inferences.
- In addition to logical inference, Russell admits the concept of _psychological inference_, whereby a person correctly passes "from one belief to another" without deducing the logical connection in precise detail. He offers the example of reading, where a person is seldom aware of the significance of the individual letters and cannot be said to have understood the text's meaning through strict, step-by-step logical inference.
- The accuracy of _derivative_ knowledge can be referred to the possibility of inferring it from _intuitive_ knowledge. It is harder, Russell suggests, to say what makes some intuitive beliefs true and others false.
- Here, again, Russell invokes the distinction between knowledge by _acquaintance_ (i.e., by direct perception of a fact) and knowledge by _judgment_. The former is the situation of someone who knows the sun is setting because they actually watch it sink below the horizon; the latter is the situation of someone who knows (say, from an almanac) what time the sun is to set on a given day.
- Knowledge by means of judgment is prone to error, whereas knowledge of a directly perceived fact is infallible. Judgments have varying degrees of self-evidence, from "almost certain" to "more likely than not."
- Beliefs formed from these less-than-certain judgments are, Russell proposes, _probable opinion_ rather than real _knowledge_. Much of what is called knowledge falls into this category.
- Although coherence does not prove a collection of beliefs to be true, Russell suggests that it may still serve as a _criterion_ for judging probable opinion: "a body of individually probable opinions, if they are mutually coherent, become more probable than any one of them would be individually." Such beliefs can approach, though never quite attain, the level of completely certain knowledge.
___
# Chapter 14 : The Limits of Philosophical Knowledge | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- Bertrand Russell notes that his discussion so far has skimmed or ignored many traditional topics of philosophical speculation, such as God, the existence of good and evil, and the reality or unreality of matter.
- He now raises an example of a modern philosopher who attempted to use logic to attain "knowledge concerning the universe as a whole": Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.
- Hegel's major thesis, as Russell describes it, was that any apparently separate piece of the universe—whether object or idea—is incomplete, and that this incompleteness becomes evident upon reflection.
- To reason his way out of the incompleteness of ideas, Hegel proposed a process of _synthesis_ in which an incomplete idea is combined with its opposite, or _antithesis_. As this process is repeated, the ideas become more complete and more adequate to characterize reality. Finally, an "Absolute Idea" and an "Absolute Reality" are reached.
- Russell acknowledges that this is a "sublime" conception of the universe, but he takes issue with Hegel's grounds for asserting the fragmentariness of things. He disputes, in particular, the idea that the nature of a thing can ever be known well enough to assert that it is fragmentary or incomplete in the way Hegel maintains.
- Hegel's metaphysics, Russell now suggests, reflect a trend in much modern philosophy to identify apparent contradictions in the actual world and reason on the basis of those contradictions.
- Generally, it has been found that these apparent contradictions are illusory. For example, when Kant reasons that space and time are unreal because of their apparently self-contradictory features, his logic may be sound, but his premises reflect an incomplete understanding of space and time.
- Ultimately, Russell argues, this is a liberating trend. Increased knowledge of the universe, and increased mathematical understanding in particular, has turned logic from a tool for ruling things out into a tool for exploring what might be true.
- Philosophy, he suggests, serves best as a means of critiquing knowledge: of examining its basis and assuring its consistency. As a discipline, it "diminishes the risk of error" in human thought, even though it does not contribute much positive knowledge of its own.
___
# Chapter 15 : The Value of Philosophy | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- Bertrand Russell offers some parting words about the value of philosophy and the reasons for studying it.
- In order to appreciate philosophy, he contends, it is necessary to look beyond the immediate practical results or applications that are expected in other areas of thought. Philosophy's value is found "exclusively among the goods of the mind."
- The fact that philosophy can pose many more questions than it answers, Russell continues, need not be considered a flaw. The very act of asking and exploring such questions liberates a person from "prejudices" and "habitual beliefs" that might otherwise go unexamined.
- Moreover, philosophy allows for an "escape" from the constant preoccupation with oneself and a concomitant enlargement of one's worldview. The "freedom and impartiality" of such a perspective become, in turn, part of the individual's way of life, fostering justice and equanimity in dealings with others. Philosophical contemplation, Russell concludes, "makes us citizens of the universe."

1.

> Is there any knowledge in the world which is so certain that no reasonable man could doubt it? 

[Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Problems-of-Philosophy/key-figures/#Bertrand_Russell), [Chapter 1](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Problems-of-Philosophy/chapter-1-summary/)

_The Problems of Philosophy_ begins with this seemingly simple question. From there Bertrand Russell takes up and critiques the commonsense notion of knowledge, asking what it means to really "know" something. He shows that much of what is ordinarily called knowledge is on shaky ground if examined closely. In particular, "knowledge" of the external physical world is based on unprovable—though highly practical and almost universally shared—beliefs.

2.

> We cannot have reason to reject a belief except on the ground of some other belief. 

[Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Problems-of-Philosophy/key-figures/#Bertrand_Russell), [Chapter 2](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Problems-of-Philosophy/chapter-2-summary/)

One of Russell's fundamental assertions in _The Problems of Philosophy_ is that "instinctive beliefs" are necessary. Without some beliefs—for instance, a belief in noncontradiction—it is impossible to make any justifiable assertions about the world whatsoever. It is impossible, in other words, to prove anything while doubting everything.

3.

> The truth about physical objects must be strange. 

[Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Problems-of-Philosophy/key-figures/#Bertrand_Russell), [Chapter 4](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Problems-of-Philosophy/chapter-4-summary/)

Throughout the book Russell is careful not to ridicule even the strangest-sounding beliefs of past philosophers. This is not just politeness on his part but a reminder that the truth about reality does not necessarily conform to common sense. Indeed, common sense demonstrably fails in providing answers about the fundamental nature of the physical world. Thus, the truth—if it can be known—is bound to violate commonsense expectations.

4.

> The man who has fed the chicken every day throughout its life at last wrings its neck instead. 

[Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Problems-of-Philosophy/key-figures/#Bertrand_Russell), [Chapter 6](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Problems-of-Philosophy/chapter-6-summary/)

In this chapter Russell lays out the principle of induction, the instinctive belief by which people predict the future from consistent observations in the past. His point here, somewhat grimly made, is that induction is not foolproof. Reality can fulfill expectations with great consistency for a long time—and then suddenly fail to do so.

5.

> All empirical generalizations are more uncertain than the instances of them. 

[Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Problems-of-Philosophy/key-figures/#Bertrand_Russell), [Chapter 7](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Problems-of-Philosophy/chapter-7-summary/)

This observation points to a problem not just with induction but with any belief that is generalized from empirical observations. To see the point more clearly, suppose a certain person has only ever seen white swans. The next individual swan that the person sees is very likely to be white as well. Yet this is still a long way from proving that _all_ swans are white, a claim that requires every individual instance to be true as well.

6.

> Can we ever know anything at all, or do we merely sometimes by good luck believe what is true? 

[Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Problems-of-Philosophy/key-figures/#Bertrand_Russell), [Chapter 13](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Problems-of-Philosophy/chapter-13-summary/)

Here, Russell raises a potentially demoralizing doubt about the limits of knowledge. He eventually rejects this doubt and affirms that _some_ kinds of knowledge are indeed possible. Before that, however, Russell critically examines what is usually called "knowledge" and determines that much of it is, at best, "probable opinion."

7.

> Instead of being shut in within narrow walls ... we find ourselves in an open world of free possibilities, where ... there is so much to know. 

[Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Problems-of-Philosophy/key-figures/#Bertrand_Russell), [Chapter 14](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Problems-of-Philosophy/chapter-14-summary/)

Russell now suggests a bright side to the failures of earlier, more self-assured philosophical systems. Because so little can be said with certainty about the fundamental nature of reality, philosophical speculation is more "open" than ever before. It might be said that attempts to establish "what is" have given way to a vast expanse of "what ifs."

8.

> It is exclusively among the goods of the mind that the value of philosophy is to be found. 

[Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Problems-of-Philosophy/key-figures/#Bertrand_Russell), [Chapter 15](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Problems-of-Philosophy/chapter-15-summary/)

In the final chapter Russell undertakes a defense of the value of philosophy despite its inability to offer definitive answers to ultimate questions. He argues that a fixation on the "practical" value of intellectual activity is sadly misguided. A discipline that stimulates the mind and broadens the imagination, he asserts, would be valuable for those reasons alone.

9.

> Greatness of soul is not fostered by those philosophies which assimilate the universe to Man. Knowledge is a form of union of Self and not-Self. 

[Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Problems-of-Philosophy/key-figures/#Bertrand_Russell), [Chapter 15](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Problems-of-Philosophy/chapter-15-summary/)

To really benefit from the study of philosophy, Russell suggests, it is important to keep an open mind, not seeking merely to confirm one's assumptions or prejudices. To do otherwise—to begin with preconceived notions about the world and then try to prove them—is to "assimilate the universe to Man." This kind of "assimilation" is evident in several of the failed or incomplete theories cited in earlier chapters.

10.

> The impartiality which, in contemplation, is the unalloyed desire for truth, is the very same quality of mind which, in action, is justice, and in emotion is ... universal love. 

[Bertrand Russell](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Problems-of-Philosophy/key-figures/#Bertrand_Russell), [Chapter 15](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Problems-of-Philosophy/chapter-15-summary/)

Although he recognizes philosophy's lack of appeal to the "practical man," Russell holds out hope that the study of philosophy will nonetheless materially improve society—just indirectly. He suggests that if people cultivate the habits of mind that philosophy encourages, they will become less selfish and thus kinder and fairer to one another.

# Glossary 

**acquaintance:** _(n)_ Bertrand Russell's term for immediate knowledge of something. Such knowledge does not extend very far, if at all, beyond the senses; thus, most knowledge is indirect.

**analytic knowledge:** _(n)_ knowledge obtained by taking apart (analyzing) components of a statement. From the statement "He is a bad man," the statement "He is a man" can be deduced analytically.

**a priori:** _(adj)_ literally "from the earlier." Knowledge and judgments are called a priori if they do not depend on experience or evidence; thus, mathematical truths are a priori.

**coherence:** _(n)_ state in which all the elements of a belief system are mutually consistent. Since at least some fundamental beliefs are not provable, Russell advances coherence as a possible alternative standard by which to judge philosophical systems.

**deduction:** _(n)_ process by which inferences are made on the basis of general principles. Russell argues that deduction can produce new knowledge when the principles are applied to new objects.

**empiricism:** _(n)_ school of early modern philosophy that held all knowledge to be obtained through experience. John Locke and David Hume are among the best-known empiricists.

**idealism:** _(n)_ the philosophical belief that matter does not truly exist outside of minds. For idealists, what seem to be physical objects are actually minds or, more commonly, ideas in a mind.

**induction:** _(n)_ process by which inferences are made on the basis of particular examples. Russell describes the principle of induction as an example of intuitive, unprovable knowledge.

**law of contradiction:** _(n)_ principle stating that "nothing can both be and not be." According to the law of contradiction, a rose cannot be both red and not red.

**law of identity:** _(n)_ principle stating that "whatever is, is." According to the law of identity, a rose is a rose.

**law of the excluded middle:** _(n)_ principle stating that "everything must either be or not be." According to the law of the excluded middle, a given rose must either be red or not be red.

**particulars:** _(n, pl)_ specific people, places, and things that exist individually, as contrasted with universals. Russell observes that nouns are usually used to denote particulars, whereas other parts of speech convey universals.

**phenomenon:** _(n)_ object as present through a person's experiences. Russell borrows this term from Immanuel Kant and, like Kant, distinguishes the phenomenon from the object itself.

**rationalism:** _(n)_ a school of early modern philosophy that held some knowledge to be independent of experience. This school, which rivaled empiricism, is represented by René Descartes and Gottfried Leibniz.

**sense-data:** _(n, pl)_ Russell's term for any information received directly through the senses. Sense-data are distinguished from sensations (the act of sensing something) and from any inferences, however simple, that are made on the basis of those data.

**synthetic knowledge:** _(n)_ knowledge attained by combining (synthesizing) other, simpler statements. The statement "Joe is a bad man" can be arrived at synthetically from the statements "Joe is a man" and "Joe is bad."

**universals:** _(n, pl)_ general ideas that can be applied to particular objects but do not have an independent physical existence. The brown table in Russell's study is a particular, but the color brown is a universal.

# Biography

### Early Life and Education  

Bertrand Arthur William Russell, 3rd Earl Russell of Kingston Russell and Viscount Amberly of Amberley and Ardsalla, was born May 18, 1872, in Trelleck, Monmouthshire, Wales, in Great Britain. Russell's mother and sister died of diphtheria, a nose and throat infection, in 1874, and his father died of bronchitis two years later, so the philosopher barely knew his freethinking parents.

Russell's father had granted custody of his sons (Russell and his elder brother Frank) to atheist friends, but their paternal grandparents had the will overturned. As a result the boys were raised by their grandmother, Countess Russell, after her husband died when Russell was five. While Frank was sent away to school, Russell's early education began with tutors at home, under the supervision of the highly educated and religious Countess Russell. Russell learned French, German, and mathematics at an early age and began to have doubts about Christianity in his adolescence. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge in 1890, where he met English mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead (1861–1947), with whom he would later collaborate on _Principia Mathematica_ (1910–13). Awarded high honors in mathematics in 1893, Russell became interested in philosophy and won a fellowship based on his thesis, _An Essay on the Foundations of Geometry_, published as his first philosophical work in 1897. He won a first-class degree with distinction in philosophy in 1894 and was elected as a fellow to Trinity in 1895.

### Work in Political Science and Mathematics

Between 1894 and 1896 Russell married his first wife, Alyssa Pearsall Smith (1867–1951), and became an agnostic: someone who neither denies nor asserts the existence of a divine being. He also formulated a plan to write two books—one on the philosophy of the sciences and one on social and political issues. The couple visited Berlin in 1895, which resulted in Russell's first political treatise, _German Social Democracy_ (1896). Russell sympathized with the Socialists in Germany but was critical of the dogma of German philosopher Karl Marx (1818–83), who advocated for a more radical form of socialism in which the means of production is owned by the working class.

Shortly after writing his book on socialism, Russell abandoned the metaphysical idealism of German philosophers Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831). Russell rejected the notion of any kind of absolute, timeless substance beyond or behind the physical world. Rather, he was interested in creating a precise philosophy of mathematics that would be scientific and rigorous. Russell had acquainted himself with the work of German mathematicians who wanted to prove mathematics could be grounded in a foundation of logic. He came to the conclusion that analysis, not synthesis, was the way for philosophy to move forward. Analytic and synthetic propositions in philosophy differ in that analytic statements are based on sensory data (either one's own or data collected by others), while synthetic statements are based on reasoning about sensory data.

Inspired by the work of the Germans, Russell wanted to show mathematics was nothing but logic—an idea later called _logicism_. He elaborated his ideas in _The Principles of Mathematics_, published in 1903. Before publication when Russell quickly added an appendix, he learned German mathematician Gottlob Frege (1848–1925) had anticipated some of his ideas. The appendix discusses Frege's earlier discoveries. In his own treatise Russell also elaborates on his discovery of a contradiction at the heart of logicism, dubbed "Russell's Paradox," which continued to be a stumbling block in his development of an all-encompassing logical system.

The contradiction stems from an attempt to provide a systematic mathematical description of sets (collections of objects). The classic concrete illustration involves a barbershop, where the barber shaves exactly those men who do not shave themselves. Does the barber shave himself or not? If he doesn't, then he belongs to the set of men who don't shave themselves ... and thus shaves himself. Analogous constructions in set theory lead to an analogous problem: is "the set of all sets that are not members of themselves" a member of itself? Paradoxically, both "yes" and "no" answers are possible. Worse yet, a "no" can be inferred from a "yes," and vice versa.

Russell continued to wrestle with his paradox, which resulted in a theory of types and other logical innovations published in a three-volume work written with Whitehead and titled _Principia Mathematica_. Their groundbreaking work was published from 1910 to 1913. Immensely important in the development of the philosophy of mathematics, their theory of descriptions helped remove the logical awkwardness of appearing to refer to things that do not exist. Nonetheless, American mathematician Kurt Gödel (1906–78) proved no single theory can be used to derive the whole of mathematics and all consistent theories of arithmetic are necessarily incomplete. Russell wrote subsequent philosophical works focusing on epistemology (theory of knowledge) arguing the world is made of sense data. He eventually replaced this idea with "neutral monism," or the theory that the "ultimate stuff" of the world is neither mental nor physical but something between the two.

### Russell, Morrell, and Wittgenstein

While Russell continued his philosophical work, his marriage deteriorated. In 1911 he fell in love with the married Lady Ottoline Morrell (1873–1938), who was not interested in leaving her husband. Russell left his wife, though, and began writing, partly because of Morrell's influence, in a style suited for a general audience. This resulted in the best-selling survey of philosophy called _The Problems of Philosophy_, published in 1912. In it Russell channeled his professional interest in epistemology to ask provocative but accessible questions about the nature of truth and reality. Writing for and speaking to the public—not only on mathematics and philosophy but also on a host of social issues—became an increasingly important part of Russell's career.

Russell also met the young British philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889–1951), who had come to Cambridge to study logic with him. Wittgenstein ended up publishing a text undermining Russell's approach to the subject. This led Russell to give up writing technical philosophy and begin pursuing other interests. In fact, because of Wittgenstein's criticisms of his work, he abandoned a companion volume to the _Principia Mathematica_, which would have had epistemology as its subject.

### Agitator for Peace and Political Change

Russell worked full-time as a peace agitator after the British entered World War I (1914–18). He ended up serving five months in prison at the end of the war. In 1916 he was fired from his professorship at Trinity College because of his antiwar activities. The college offered to rehire him after the war, but Russell instead became a journalist and freelance writer. The war pushed him to express his socialist ideas in a number of books. He continued promoting a socialist and progressive agenda with his new wife, Dora Black (1894–1986). They married in 1921 and had two children. Russell expanded the scope of his writing to include education, morality, and social issues. During this period he delivered his famous public lecture, "Why I Am Not a Christian." In 1927 the couple opened a progressive school, Beacon Hill, and Russell lectured in the United States. Because both Russell and his wife did not follow conventional morality, Dora had two children with another man. Eventually the couple could not resolve their differences, and Russell married Patricia Spence (1910–2004) in 1936 and had another child who grew up to be a prominent historian.

Russell lived in the United States from 1938 until 1944, first teaching at the University of Chicago and then at the University of California, Los Angeles. He was hired by City College of New York, but his appointment was revoked because of complaints about his morals. Then he was hired by the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia to lecture on philosophy. These lectures formed the basis for what became _A History of Western Philosophy_ (1945). He lost his job at the foundation after a falling out with the founder. In 1944 he returned to Trinity College and finally lost his status as a outsider. He received the Order of Merit from the British government in 1949 and the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1950, in large part because of his work on _A History of Western Philosophy_, which was also a best-selling book and a major source of income. However, his third marriage also fell apart.

### Final Years

Russell married for the fourth and final time in 1952, this time to Edith Finch (1900–78), at age 80. In 1955 he and German-American physicist Albert Einstein (1879–1955) signed and released a declaration to world leaders calling for an end to war in the age of nuclear weapons. He spent his remaining years involved in peace work, campaigning against nuclear weapons and in the 1960s against the Vietnam War (1954–75). Russell took part in mass demonstrations and incited young people to commit acts of civil disobedience in the name of peace. In 1961 when Russell was 89, he was sentenced to jail time for his role in antinuclear protests, although he ended up spending only a week in the prison hospital. Russell died on February 2, 1970, at age 97. While at the time he was best known as a social critic, he is remembered as an essayist, logician, and philosopher of mathematics. He produced 70 books and many articles in his lifetime and refined Frege's predicate calculus, the basis for most contemporary systems of logic. Together with Wittgenstein and English philosopher G.E. Moore (1873–1958), he is the founder of modern analytic philosophy. His and Whitehead's _Principia Mathematica_ remains an important text in the study of logic.
