### At a Glance

_The Myth of Sisyphus_, a collection of essays defining absurdism, is considered an important philosophical work of the 20th century, adjacent to the philosophies of existentialism and nihilism. As a writer, Camus wrote both fiction and nonfiction, but his philosophical ideas can be found even within his works of fiction. In his essays defining his philosophy of the absurd, Camus draws upon references to other philosophers, novelists, and dramatists to demonstrate why the absurd should be seriously considered as a means of navigating life. Camus attempts to liberate people internally by defining the problem of consciousness as the human tendency—and need—to impose meaning and order upon a world that has no discernible unity and is indifferent to its inhabitants. Camus also sees human beings as not belonging in the world because their consciousness causes them to be aware that they are separate from its indifference to them. He urges his readers to accept this reality, and the reality of death, and, consequently, live life to its fullest by seeing it as an adventure in which a large number of diverse experiences, as well as artistic creativity, can offer excitement and hope.

_The Myth of Sisyphus_ argues against the tendency to use religion as a way of finding meaning in life. Since human beings cannot be certain of God or immortality, they should not willfully blind themselves and submit to an idea that cannot be seen or touched, Camus says. The collection's questioning of religion is reflective of a time in which fewer people belonged to organized religions, a time that was marked by unprecedented loss of human life because of war. In conversation with the philosophical and literary works that came before his, Camus adds to philosophy ideas that are unique to the era in which he lived. _The Myth of Sisyphus_ remains relevant today as a philosophical influence that has impacted culture and art. Camus's thoughtful insights provide a new interpretation in considering the meaning of existence and how to accept the absurdity of life yet live it to the fullest.

### About the Title

_The Myth of Sisyphus_ refers to the Greek myth of Sisyphus, a Greek king who was condemned by the gods to push a large boulder up a steep mountain, where it would roll back down again once he reached the top. Sisyphus was forced to retrieve the boulder and push it up the mountain again, over and over for eternity. Camus finds an element of his philosophy of the absurd in Sisyphus's plight, given his acceptance of the futility of his fate.

# Main Ideas

## Accepting the Absurd

Camus begins his entire inquiry with some basic philosophical inquiries that many other philosophers have addressed: What is the point of existence? If there is no meaning to life, what is the point of staying alive? The notion of "logical suicide" poses a problem that Camus aims to solve. Although he agrees with existential philosophers that humans create their own lives and are responsible for them, he takes it a step further with his philosophy of the absurd. Camus's philosophy entails accepting and even embracing the absurd, and it is why he uses the seemingly senseless myth of Sisyphus as a parable for what embracing the absurd might look like. Sisyphus is condemned to push a rock up a hill for eternity, where it slides back down and he must descend to retrieve it, repeating this act forever.

Yet Camus compares Sisyphus to the modern worker, who toils at the same job day in and day out with little meaning or hope of a better future to be had. Camus imagines Sisyphus not only accepting his fate but also even finding a kind of peace through contemplation when he returns down the mountain each time. For Camus, Sisyphus's awareness of his predicament yet his soldiering on in spite of it amounts to the kind of "revolt" Camus finds intrinsic in the absurd—a revolt against illusion. Accepting the absurd means accepting the contradiction between the human desire for meaning and the possibility that there is no meaning to be found.

## The Human Condition and the Search for Meaning

Camus highlights the many ways in which human beings seek meaning, explanations for existence, and truth, which, to Camus, usually all turn out to be illusions. This need for meaning is a basic human desire and a part of the human condition, and it is the reason why religions form. Throughout the essays Camus takes special care to explain the erroneous mental "leap" philosophers take when their reasoning goes awry and they embrace the belief that there is an eternal God, and that life continues for the human soul after death. He addresses the paradox that if God exists, that would mean God is cruel, given all the irrational horror of the world. It would also mean that humans are not responsible for their own fates. If God does not exist, then humans are responsible for their own lives, and there is no meaning to be derived in their fates. Further, it is impossible to know if God exists with any certainty, and Camus believes that humans should think only in terms of what can be known in physical terms—what they can see and touch for themselves.

At the same time, Camus doesn't stretch his philosophy as far as the bleak nihilism prescribed by other philosophers, who take a colder view of the indifferent universe. Part of accepting the absurd is accepting the human desire for meaning while also accepting the contradiction that there is no evidence of any real meaning. Absurdism seeks to describe and experience, and Camus emphasizes that a person doesn't require a purpose to engage in those activities. While Camus begins with the question of whether suicide is logical if life has no meaning, his inquiry leads him to the absurdist belief that, in fact, the opposite of surrendering life is true—people should experience as much as possible in life.

## Creativity as an Act of the Absurd

Although it may seem contrary to create something in the face of meaninglessness and futility, Camus argues that the contrary is true when it comes to the absurd. He highlights different writers and figures that he believes embody the absurd in their creations, from actors to writers. The distinction of absurd art is that it doesn't seek to create meaning but to act as an experience that describes rather than explains all that is to be experienced in life.

An actor, for example, may experience a lifetime of living and dying in only a few hours while the actor inhabits a character onstage. Within playing a role, the actor can also face and accept their own meaningless fate and looming, eventual death. Likewise, authors such as Fyodor Dostoevsky and Franz Kafka create characters and stories that display the problem of the absurd in all its intricate facets, including the logical problem of suicide and the meaninglessness of existence. Many of these characters don't attempt to solve the problem of meaninglessness, but rather investigate what it would mean to live life with this awareness—even if their authors' themes offer the consolations that Camus must disagree with as part of his own view.

For the wholly absurd artist, Camus points the reader to the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, who says, "We have art in order not to die of the truth." Camus concurs with Nietzsche when he states, "If the world were clear, art would not exist." There appears to be something about art that philosophy cannot resolve or answer, and Camus is interested in that expression that he believes can "give the void its colors." Art, then, is a way to describe and express the absurd, even if no meaning is to be found within it.

# Key Figure Analysis

## Franz Kafka

Franz Kafka is a Czech-born German-language writer whom critics often identify as a writer of the modernist genre, and whose works respond to the alienation and anxiety that other writers and artists also observed at the turn of the 20th century. His short stories and novels often have ambiguous qualities that lend themselves to multiple interpretations. Camus finds much in Kafka's work to be exemplary of absurd philosophy, given its contradictions and acceptance of the futility of existence.

## Don Juan

In Tirso de Molina's play _The Trickster of Seville_, Don Juan seduces multiple women by entering their bedchambers in disguise or promising them love and marriage. Knowing the danger that satisfying his desires will mean losing his zest for life, Don Juan breaks his promises but keeps his passion for love by never expending it in a sterile relationship with one woman. Camus uses the example of Don Juan as an absurd character. To Camus, Don Juan's love of quantity over quality in his relations makes him absurd, as well as his acceptance of a fate in which no one encounter means more than any other.

## Sisyphus

Sisyphus is a character from Greek mythology that Camus uses as an example of an absurd hero. Sisyphus is a mortal king who cheats death twice, a feat that angered the gods. As punishment, he is condemned to push a rock up a hill in the underworld only to have it slide back down the hill, where he must retrieve it and roll it back up for eternity. Camus imagines that Sisyphus finds some happiness in contemplating his task, and it is this acceptance of the futility of his fate that makes him absurd.

## Kirilov

Kirilov is a minor character in Dostoevsky's novel _The Possessed_. He conceives of a strange philosophical line of reasoning that leads him to conclude that committing suicide will turn him into a god. Kirilov's friends end up using his glorification of suicide to their advantage during a political intrigue that happens in a small Russian town. After murdering a mutual friend, Kirilov's manipulative friends convince him to take the blame for the murder and then kill himself. Camus sees Kirilov as an absurd character because his logic regarding suicide embodies two qualities of the absurd philosophy: revolt and freedom. However, Kirilov does not align with absurdism in that he actually does commit suicide.

# Brief Summary

## Summary

### An Absurd Reasoning

_The Myth of Sisyphus_ aims to examine fully the problem of suicide—namely, whether there is logical reasoning to defend it. The issue of whether life has meaning must be addressed to solve the problem. [Camus](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Myth-of-Sisyphus/author/) hypothesizes that suicide is not defendable, even if a person does not believe in God or divine punishment. He believes there are two methods to arrive at an answer to the question: by evidence or by story. Most people who commit suicide do it because they believe there is no reason to live, and Camus calls the recognition of that feeling that life has no meaning "the absurd." The absurd is born within a person when the question of "why" arises in response to their life. From there, two paths emerge: suicide or acceptance of the meaninglessness. The absurd is discomfort over one's humanity, and a person's mind is constantly trying to distinguish what is true from what is false. All anyone can know for certain is that they have feelings and know they exist, and that they know the world exists because they can touch it. Camus believes the world is fundamentally irrational, however, and so trying to find a single meaning for it is futile. In confronting the fact that the world is irrational, the absurd is born within a person. Once awareness begins, it cannot be escaped.

Many philosophers suggest religion as an avenue for meaning or an escape from the struggles of life, but Camus finds this reasoning a leap. He believes the answer lies in accepting the "ailment" of absurdity, not the "cure" of religion. However, he accepts that the religious philosopher and the abstract philosopher begin with the same question about the meaning of life, but their conclusions diverge. Camus arrives at the conclusion that life is actually lived better if there is no meaning, and by contemplating the absurd nature of it. One way to do this is by not resigning to the notion of having a purpose. Life should be lived through a quantity of experiences, not based on the quality of experiences or other value judgments. The absurdity of one's life and their eventual death are all a person needs to wake them up so that they can truly experience being.

### The Absurd Man

Camus provides a series of examples that he feels personify the "absurd man"—a person who prizes courage and reason over nostalgia and belief. His first example is the fictional archetype of [Don Juan](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Myth-of-Sisyphus/key-figure-analysis/#Don_Juan), who can be traced back to a 17th-century Spanish play. Camus characterizes him as an absurd man because although he is known for his seductiveness, he accepts that the outcome will always be the same—he's not searching for deeper meaning or illusory love. The absurd person can also be found in drama, as an actor and their role, because actors live and die within the characters they portray on the stage. The actor can only live in the present. Camus's final example is the absurd conqueror, who, longing for an eternal life he can never have, chooses to join history and live a life of action liberating individuals from the society that makes them powerless.

### Absurd Creation

Camus believes that the absurd can also be found in the creation of art when it does not attempt to provide meaning or consolation. He uses the example of the Russian 19th-century novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky (1821–81), whose protagonists constantly question the meaning of life. Some of them ponder the reasoning for "logical suicide" and arrive at the same conclusion as Camus about the absurdity of the world. Though much of Dostoevsky's work fits Camus's definition of absurd art, Camus concludes that Dostoevsky's logic ultimately takes "the leap" Camus disagrees with by embracing belief in the existence of God and an eternal afterlife for human souls. Finally, Camus considers the responsibility of the absurd artist to "give the void its colors" through the expression of thought that both contradictorily magnifies and negates, even while accepting creativity's futility.

### The Myth of Sisyphus

Camus introduces the Greek myth of [Sisyphus](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Myth-of-Sisyphus/key-figure-analysis/#Sisyphus) to illustrate his ideas about the absurd. In the myth, Sisyphus is condemned by the gods to eternally roll a rock up a steep hill, then retrieve it after it rolls back down to the bottom. In Camus's eyes, Sisyphus is the ultimate absurd hero because he accepts his fate and lives in the eternal present without straining to find meaning in his plight. In this way, Sisyphus is even superior to his fate. He is also a parable of the modern worker, who often performs the same task over and over until death, and whose fate is no less absurd.

### Appendix: Hope and the Absurd in the Work of Franz Kafka

Camus concludes with a close examination of the absurd in the literature of the 20th-century German-language author [Franz Kafka](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Myth-of-Sisyphus/key-figure-analysis/#Franz_Kafka) (1883—1924). Camus highlights how Kafka's work oscillates between the tragic and the everyday as well as between the absurd and the logical. These contradictions are what make his work an example of the absurd to Camus. However, Camus concludes that Kafka only exemplifies the problem of the absurd. Like all of the other artists Camus discusses, Kafka abandons the absurd to seek consolation in God and the eternal instead.

# Preface | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- Camus states that the ideas in _The Myth of Sisyphus_ are continued further in his book _The Rebel_, but while the _Myth of Sisyphus_ attempts to solve the problem of suicide, _The Rebel_ attempts to solve the problem of murder.
- The fundamental subject of the book is that it is necessary to wonder whether life has a meaning, and out of this arises the question of suicide. Camus declares that suicide is not legitimate, even if a person does not believe in God.
___
# Part 1, Chapter 1 : An Absurd Reasoning (Absurdity and Suicide) | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- The question of suicide is the one truly serious philosophical problem because it invites individuals to judge whether life is worth living—a fundamental question of philosophy. All other questions arise from this one.
- In wondering how to answer the question of suicide, Camus believes there are two methods, one based in evidence and one in lyricism, or story.
- Suicide is mainly considered on the level of a social phenomenon, yet Camus sets out to investigate the connection between "individual thought" and suicide. The act of suicide, says Camus, "is prepared within the silence of the heart" like a great work of art is, even if the person is unaware of this process happening within.
- Camus states that suicide is an act of confession in that the person who commits it is confessing that life is too much to bear or that they do not understand life. Yet living life does not come naturally to most people, who continue to do it only out of habit. To voluntarily die means to believe that the habit of living is without reason.
- Camus describes how a person who realizes there is no profound reason for living feels like an alien or stranger and becomes divorced from life like an actor removed from the setting. Stripped of life's illusions, this person has no memory of home and no "promised land" to look forward to. Camus labels the recognition of this feeling _absurdity_. He aims to explore "the exact degree to which suicide is a solution to the absurd."
- Camus also admits that there are inherent contradictions in trying to answer the question of suicide because the body is in the habit of living before it learns the habit of thinking about living. What Camus is most concerned with is the logic of suicide, and whether it can be divorced from emotion.
___
#  Part 1, Chapter 2 : An Absurd Reasoning (Absurd Walls) | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- Camus concedes that other people are essentially unknowable, but they can be recognized by their behavior and actions and the outcomes of their lives.
- People define themselves by what they believe as well as what they feel compelled to do—their impulses.
- Camus pinpoints the moment that the notion of absurdity is born within a person: when the question "why" arises in response to the prescribed patterns of everyday life. From that point on, only awakening to absurdism can occur, resulting in either suicide or recovery into life.
- Another moment that arises in a person's life is an understanding of existence in relation to time, which Camus demonstrates as happening around 30 years old. A person will realize that they are on a track that has an endpoint. And the person will also realize where on that trajectory they are situated in time. To understand this aspect of life is to acknowledge death, and the realization turns time into an enemy. Camus refers to this facing of the reality of time as "cruel mathematics." What is absurd is that people are always longing for tomorrow when, in actuality, "everything in [a person] ought to reject it." Camus refers to this absurdity as a "revolt of the flesh."
- Camus further defines the absurd as a sense of discomfort over one's own humanity, when, for example, in a moment of clarity, they see as if from afar their own mechanical gestures, their inhumanness. Or the absurd arises when someone is startled by their image in a mirror as if seeing someone else looking back.
- One inherent problem of death is that no one still living can experience it, and the dead cannot describe the experience. Further, Camus says, human beings cannot truly fathom death. People live as though death is an illusion, which informs the attitudes they may have about it and the fear surrounding it.
- The mind is constantly working to distinguish what is true from what is false. All a person can say for sure is that they have feelings and know they exist, and they can touch the world and know it exists. Everything after that is a construction of the mind. A person can have certainty that they exist and try to reinforce that certainty with content, but there will always be a gap between the two.
- Different philosophers have come up with various theories regarding the human condition. For example, German philosopher Martin Heidegger believed that anxiety is the only reality possible for humans. This anxiety, for many people, Camus says, can emerge as brief and fleeting fear. But for a person who becomes consciously aware of this fear and realizes at the same time that the world can't offer any solace or comfort, the anxiety turns to anguish.
- Another philosopher Camus discusses is the German philosopher Karl Jaspers, who was able to point out the flaws in almost every illusory system human beings create to console themselves. Jaspers, Camus points out, knowing the mind is a failure—and in the face of "everlasting nothingness"—still tried to find the threads of "divine secrets." In contrast, Søren Kierkegaard, Camus says, "does more than discover the absurd, he lives it" as "an absurd spirit itself grappling with a reality beyond its comprehension." Wherever any of these philosophers' thoughts led them, they all began at the same place: the indescribable universe where "contradiction, antinomy, anguish, or impotence reigns."
- Camus believes the world does not have a single meaning that can be derived from it because the world is irrational. All that can be determined is that humans have a consciousness and knowledge of the concrete world around them.
- When a person is confronted with the irrationality of the world, they seek happiness and reason. It is out of the confrontation between the irrational world and this human need that the absurd is "born."

# Part 1, Chapter 3 : An Absurd Reasoning (Philosophical Suicide) | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- The feeling of absurd is not the same as the idea of the absurd, Camus says. Then Camus works to define what is meant by the word _absurd_ and its connotations. He notes that it means "'it's impossible'" but also "'it's contradictory.'" Accusing a person who has lived a virtuous life of a monstrous crime will seem absurd because it is both impossible and contradictory. Further, in another example Camus gives, watching a man with a sword confront an army of machine guns is absurd also because of the disproportion between intention and reality.
- Camus compares the absurd to a divorce, in that "it lies in neither of the elements compared; it is born of their confrontation." The absurd is born of the conflict between humans and the world—between what humans desire and what the world has to offer. Like everything else, Camus says, the absurd also ends with death.
- A person who has become aware of the absurd can never _not_ be aware of it, yet it is natural to try to escape this awareness.
- Camus analyzes the ways in which other philosophers have struggled with solving the problem of the absurd and finds that most suggest religion as an escape from struggling with the concept. They cannot remain in a state of comparison between two elements; they eventually give in and embrace the eternal. The philosopher Lev Chestov (also translated as Shestov) claims that humans need God for such solutions because otherwise, they would have no way to define the impossible, which God ultimately represents. However, Camus finds this reasoning to be too great a leap of logic.
- Camus also believes that the answer does not lie in religion, which is a method of seeking a cure for the "affliction" of the absurd. The answer, instead, is to accept the "ailment" of absurdity. The philosopher Kierkegaard, whose response to the absurd is to sacrifice the intellect as being a sin against God, is seeking just such a cure, Camus says. Camus, for his part, claims, "The absurd is sin without God." He means that, if Kierkegaard is correct in that sin alienates a person from God, then Camus is a sinner by his own definition because he wants to live in a way that only embraces what he can know tangibly.
- Camus calls the existential attitude "philosophical suicide" because of its tendency to negate.
- Phenomenology, which is a philosophical study of consciousness's relationship to material objects, declines to explain the world, and instead attempts to describe experiences. It also distinguishes the idea of an objective truth, which is the same for all people, from the idea that there are many subjective truths, such as the reality of a breeze or hand, because consciousness makes meaning out what it sees, and by focusing on objects, it illuminates them. Truths can be both psychological and metaphysical in how a mind understands them.
- Camus next discusses German philosopher and founder of phenomenology Edmund Husserl's line of thinking about reality and truth, which Camus likens to the ancient Greek philosopher Plato's theory of forms. The theory of forms is the idea that everything in reality has a corresponding perfect form outside of reality, including abstract concepts, such as justice, beauty, and goodness. Camus rejects Husserl's theory that "all things are not explained by one thing but by all things." He calls Husserl's logic a belief in "extra-temporal [outside of time] essences," a kind of "abstract polytheism." Camus cannot conceive of such "angel[s] or god[s]." Indeed, he sees reason itself as being somewhat unstable in that it can "turn toward the divine."
- The abstract philosopher and the religious philosopher start from the same question and anxiety. Their conclusions are divided, yet both require a leap into the transcendent to reconcile their answers. Camus calls the two different conclusions that these two types of philosophers make either "humiliated reason" or "triumphal reason." For the absurd conclusion, however, the world is unreasonable, and people are powerless to control or overcome the anxiety the world produces. Camus urges staying on "the dizzying crest" and not making the leap into the transcendent.
- For Camus, the arrival at the absurd is a question of whether to accept or refuse its conditions. He is not interested in the "philosophical suicide" of the other philosophers he describes, but in actual suicide. Within that, he aims to divorce his exploration of suicide from its emotions in order to understand its logic.

# Part 1, Chapter 4 : An Absurd Reasoning (Absurd Freedom) | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- In this chapter Camus explains that absurd reasoning produces three consequences: revolt, freedom, and passion.
- To begin the chapter Camus declares that he can negate everything within himself that is vaguely nostalgic—has a sentimental longing for the past—except his desire for unity, "this longing to solve, this need for clarity and cohesion." However, this cohesion is impossible because it is impossible to "know whether this world has a meaning that transcends it"—and it will be impossible for Camus to ever know. There are only two certainties for Camus: 1) his appetite for "the absolute and unity" and 2) the impossibility of reducing the world to something rational—or reconciling this desire for unity with the reality of the world. Further, this desire, says Camus, springs from anarchy. Camus means by this that the world is a chaos, and rather than face this fact, people embrace notions of the divine, which Camus calls "divine equivalence" and "sovereign chance," indicating that these notions are illusions to help people through life.
- This conundrum is exclusive to humans because they have consciousness. A plant or animal doesn't try to figure out how and why they exist. They belong in this world, whereas human beings are in opposition to the world. The basis of the conflict is the mind's awareness that it is separate from the world.
- Using religious metaphors that are the opposite of how the religious use them, Camus launches into his explanation of the "revolt," that is, the "permanent revolution" that absurdism is. Through absurdism's "constant awareness" that no reconciliation between the mind and the world is possible, the absurdist will be "transfigured." The "body, affection, creation, action, and human nobility" will rise up again and take their place in this "mad world." The "wine of the absurd" and "bread of indifference" will feed the absurdist's greatness. One problem the absurd believer is "tempted" by is the call to make the leap to religious belief, but the only right response is to refuse to believe in anything but what can be known for certain. In this sense, the absurd viewpoint of finally rejecting religion is a noble stance.
- Camus broaches the problem of suicide again: once someone discovers that life has no meaning, the only logical response is to commit suicide. This problem is reversed in absurdism, Camus says, because life is lived better _precisely_ because there is no meaning. To live is to keep the absurd alive by contemplating it. "Negating one of the oppositions—between mind and world—on which the [absurdist] lives" is an act of escapism. Suicide is a type of escapism too because it also ends the opposition; it "settles the absurd." The only understandable philosophical position is to remain in a constant state of revolt, accepting the certainty of death's "crushing fate." Camus finds that religious beliefs that explain everything for him also debilitate him. They "relieve him of the weight of his life"—the ability to recognize the seriousness or gravity of the human predicament—while simultaneously leaving him alone to carry it despite the relief religion attempts to offer. "The revolt gives life its value," Camus states.
- Living the absurd is embracing "extreme tension," whereas suicide is a "renunciation," just like all the other types of consolation are. It is of the utmost importance that people drain every drop from life and utterly deplete themselves while doing so. This "defiant" attitude, this revolt, is the first consequence of embracing the absurd.
- Camus moves on to ponder the problem of freedom in the context of "the problem of God," which freedom is linked to paradoxically. But, Camus says, the absurdity in the paradox has less to do with freedom than with the problem of evil: if people are not free, then God is all-powerful and responsible for evil. If people are free, they are responsible, and God is not all-powerful. Further, Camus cannot fathom how a higher being can give him freedom. His only conceptualization of freedom comes from thinking of a prisoner detained by the government. The only freedom specific to his experience is the freedom of "thought and action." The absurdist loses hope of the eternal but gains freedom of action in the present to give meaning to life.
- Furthermore, people who believe in God make themselves slaves while only perceiving that they are free, which is a lie. Before accepting a belief in the absurd, most people live with concern for the future and have aims for their life, believing their lives can be directed in some way. The reality of death is what exposes this viewpoint as a lie. And also, people should feel contempt because of the reality of death, but their belief in eternity causes them to suppress their contempt. They fence themselves in, so to speak, and become like "so many bureaucrats of the heart and mind" who "disgust" Camus.
- The absurdist knows there is no future. And waking as if from a sleep, the absurdist becomes free from the demands of everyday life. This "return to consciousness" is the "first step" to "absurd freedom." Just like the slaves in ancient Greece who knew they were not free in their society still felt free because they weren't responsible for anything, embracing absurdism liberates people in the same way. Camus acknowledges that this freedom still has the same "time limit" that death places on someone's life. But absurd freedom removes the "illusions of freedom" people have and replaces those illusions with actual freedom. Accepting the world as it is gives the absurdist strength. And the freedom that comes from knowing that all there is after death is "nothingness and collapse" is the second consequence of embracing absurdism, Camus says.
- Yet, the question arises of what life can mean after someone has accepted the absurd viewpoint and relinquished the demands of having a purpose to be achieved. Believing there is a meaning to life implies that there are values and preferences, but belief in the absurd implies the contrary. In this sense the absurd prizes quantity of experience over quality of experience. Camus claims that life can't mean anything. An absurdist must give up value judgments and replace them with factual judgments. Whether this makes life "vulgar or revolting, elegant or deplorable" doesn't matter. Even if embracing it means being dishonorable, then it is the absurdist's duty to act dishonorably.
- There may seem to be a contradiction in that the absurdist says that no experience has any value yet a person must fill up on a quantity of experiences. In a footnote Camus suggests that quantity sometimes "constitutes quality," according to scientific theory, by making things more manifest, such as in groups of atoms coming together to form something.
- For Camus, the ideal of the absurdist is to find the "purest joy" in feeling, and "in feeling on this earth," with a "constantly conscious soul" in a long line of present moments until death stops the process. This process of absurdism, which begins in anguish, will lead to "obeying the flame" of passion, passion being the third consequence of absurdism. Camus ends the chapter by saying that everything he has outlined thus far is only a manner of thinking, but the point of life is to live it.

# Part 2, Chapter 5 : The Absurd Man | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- The "absurd man" prefers courage and reasoning rather than nostalgia and belief. Courage allows the absurdist to be satisfied with what they have without appealing to God. Reasoning allows the absurdist to see their limits.
- When it comes to a moral code, Camus says that there is only one that the absurdist can accept, which is the one dictated by God. Except, for the absurdist, they happen to live outside of that God. So Camus is confirming universal morality. To illustrate what he means, Camus adds that it would be more attractive if there were a God to give life meaning than it would be to be able to be bad without being punished. He makes the point that just because someone lives without rules, it does not mean they will desire to harm others. They will still be able to see that their actions "do either a service or a disservice" to other human beings. The difference from religious morality is that the absurdist will be their own and only judge. Also, actions have consequences, so the absurd person will consider these calmly as well as be willing to pay the price for the consequences of their actions. The absurd person believes that while there is responsibility, there should be no guilt because they know that remorse is futile.
- In the upcoming section Camus will outline examples of the "absurd man" from literature and drama. These examples show the warmth that can be found in the absurd. But they should not be viewed as models of behavior.
___
# Part 2, Chapter 6 : The Absurd Man (Don Juanism) | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- Camus discusses the legend of Don Juan as an example of the absurd, comparing and contrasting a few versions of the story. Camus ends the chapter with a suggestion for an absurdist ending to the Don Juan legend.
- The legend of Don Juan was first immortalized in a 17th-century Spanish tragic play _The Trickster of Seville_ (_El burlador de Sevilla_; 1630), by Tirso De Molina. In that version of the legend, the wealthy noble Don Juan seduces multiple women by either promising to marry them or by sneaking into their chambers while pretending to be their lover. One night, when performing one of his tricks on a noblewoman named Doña Ana, Don Juan kills her father, Don Gonzalo, during a duel over Doña Ana's honor. Later, a statue of Don Gonzalo comes to life and invites Don Juan to have dinner in the cemetery where Gonzalo is buried. Don Juan agrees and is fed poisonous snakes and scorpions, which he washes down with bile and vinegar. Don Juan tries to fight Gonzalo's statue, but his sword cannot penetrate the stone, and Don Juan is dragged down into the grave.
- Camus characterizes Don Juan as an example of an absurd personality because he repeats his quest to seduce over and over despite knowing that the outcome will always be the same—he will feel the need to find another woman. Further, Don Juan loves each woman with passionate intensity and gives his whole self to the seduction—passion being a characteristic of the absurd personality. Yet, because he is aware of his mortality, Don Juan does not hope for anything, which is key to Camus's point. People who hope for things become melancholy, he says. Because Don Juan does not hope, he is a joyful figure. And because of this outlook, Camus deems him wise.
- As for sin, unlike the character Faust, who can only sell his soul to the devil _because_ he believes in God, Don Juan can gamble away the idea of a heavenly life. Not believing in an afterlife means that earthly life is all the time to live there is. Camus points out the response in Molina's play that Don Juan gives to threats of damnation, "What a long respite you give me!" In further contrast with Faust, Don Juan never allows himself to be satisfied. Camus is referencing Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's play _Faust_ (Part 1, 1808; Part 2, 1832) in which the titular character makes a deal with the devil, who is called Mephistopheles in the play. To gain powers that will enable Faust to live life to the fullest, Faust agrees—during the dealmaking with the devil—that the moment Faust feels fully satisfied he will drop down into hell and become the devil's slave. According to Camus, Don Juan is no Faust. An exemplary absurdist, Don Juan never reaches a point of satisfaction in which he loses desire for any of the women he seduces. Don Juan leaves before he loses his interest and carries with him his same feeling of desire for the next woman, and on and on. He embraces the absurd principle of prioritizing quantity of experience over quality of experience, as Camus would have it.
- As for those who want to see Don Juan punished, Camus says they hate him because his greatness insults them. And people secretly admire him. Some may say Don Juan is selfish, yet what some call selfish, Camus calls liberated. Why should Don Juan "give himself a moral problem?" Camus asks. In Oscar Milosz's version of Don Juan (_Miguel Mañara_; 1912), Mañara, the Don Juan figure, "damns himself" by trying to be a saint. In that version of the legend, the character Mañara ends up in a monastery, devoting the last years of his life to seeking God and redemption. By not believing in profound things, the absurd Don Juan, who does not seek redemption, aligns himself with time. "Time keeps up with the absurd man," Camus says, indicating one of the ideals of absurdism—that living in the present without restrictions is the best way to live. The absurdist's moral code centers on their "likes and dislikes." Only characters in stories change, Camus says, not real-life human beings.
- Camus moves on to the topic of love. He admits that Don Juan is perhaps selfish in this regard, but, for Camus, there can be no such thing as noble love in an absurd world. And the kind of love people usually strive for is "clothed in illusions of the eternal." Don Juan knows that embracing an all-or-nothing love like the character Werther is enticing, but love of this kind "impoverishes" and "devours" the object of that love. Camus is here referencing _The Sorrows of Young Werther_ (1774), a novel by Goethe in which the main character commits suicide over unrequited love. Imaginary notions of love created by "books and legends" are what bind people together. All love is, to Camus, is a combination of desire, affection, and intelligence, and this mixture is different for each person, yet there is only one reductive term for it—_love_. "The absurd man," Camus says, "multiplies what ... he cannot unify."
- Some insist that Don Juan must be punished in this life and the next, Camus says, returning to the subject of sin and morality. But a fate cannot be a punishment, Camus explains. If Don Juan is ridiculed, as an absurdist, he will accept that ridicule is appropriate for his behavior. If he turns out to be an old, pathetic man, that too will not bother him. The absurdist does not conceal anything from their own consciousness but accepts what is. It would even be fitting, Camus muses, if Don Juan did end up in a monastery—because "sensual pleasure" and "asceticism" are "two aspects of the same destitution." Camus sees that particular fate as an appropriate contradiction for the absurd man whose body has betrayed him—to live out the comedy of his life on his knees, praying to a God he doesn't believe in. However, Camus says, the perfect ending for the absurd Don Juan would be to have him high up on a hill, looking through a crack in the monastery wall out onto the "silent Spanish plain," not thinking of the past or future. This "noble, soulless land" would be a fitting representation for the absurd figure.

#  Part 2, Chapter 7 : The Absurd Man (Drama) | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- Drama, theater, and literature offer the idea of many fates made available to people. Humans are interested in themselves, and they like to see themselves reflected in these stories. Yet it is the actor above all others who exemplifies the absurd personality because the actor's domain is a fleeting one. The work of an actor in the theater only exists in the present and will die with the actor, unlike an author whose work gives the illusory hope of living on. Camus asks the reader to consider an author's work in light of 10,000 years to make this point. Only a few archaeologists will even look for evidence of our era, he says.
- The absurd can also be illustrated in the short performance time of plays—an actor has three hours to become a character on stage, and then that character "dies." Camus declares, "Never has the absurd been so well illustrated or at such length."
- In acting, the "body is king." And the "absurd miracle" of acting is that the body brings knowledge when the actor "slips into [an] imaginary form" and "transfuses [their] blood into their [characters'] phantoms." Camus means that by becoming a character, the actor understands that character more fully in a way that only the accompanying movements and gestures of the body make possible. The actor otherwise lives like a shadowy person at the crossroads of the "strange and familiar," where "the body and mind" converge, while embodying hero after hero onstage—that is, the actor has no self of their own. An actor can travel the whole course of a character's life and death in just a short time on the stage that would take an audience member a lifetime to experience.
- It is significant that, at one time, to become an actor was considered a sin in the eyes of the Catholic Church. Camus says it is not surprising that the Church would renounce the actor's art of living in the present because that practice opposes the idea of the eternal. And it is not surprising that the Church would renounce the idea of one soul hurling itself into "a multiplication of souls." Those actors who defied the Church, such as the French actress Adrienne Lecouvreur, who refused to renounce acting on her death bed, and French actor and playwright Molière, who was refused last rites by the Church, made the right choice when they risked hell and chose to live and die on the stage portraying other lives in great quantity without limitations.

# Part 3, Chapter 9 : Absurd Creation (Philosophy and Fiction) | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- Camus claims that there is "metaphysical honor in enduring the world's absurdity." But the chapter later reveals that Camus makes this statement with verbal irony in that metaphysics seeks to understand how the world came into being, whereas the absurdist, like the modern scientist, no longer tries to see the world in such depth. Instead, the absurd embraces describing and experiencing the world's diversity, "the constant attractions of a universe inexhaustible in quantity." To live with the absurd is to recognize its lessons. Yet contradictorily—as absurdism is inherently a contradiction—Camus _is_ arguing for a kind of spirituality within absurdism. "Even men without a gospel have their Mount of Olives," Camus says, pointing the reader toward an association between holiness and absurdism. The Mount of Olives in Jerusalem is a sacred burial ground, in existence for centuries, dating back to Old Testament times. Judaism, Christianity, and Islam all consider it to be a holy place.
- Creating art, though not without contradiction, is how absurdism reaches another level. Absurd joy can be found in the act of creation, as the 19th-century German philosopher Nietzsche declared, "[We] have art in order not to die from the truth." To create is to live doubly, Camus says, yet creating has no more significance than that of the actor's life and death on stage. The absurd person—conqueror, lover, actor—in whatever they do, mimes, repeats, and recreates reality. To create art is the greatest mime of all. However, art should not be seen as a refuge for the absurd person. The act of making art itself is absurd.
- To this end, Camus next poses the question of whether an absurd work of art can even be created. He stipulates the following: 1) Absurd art must be made from the most lucid thinking. 2) The reasoning behind the work of art must remain hidden. The intelligence behind the work can only act as a "regulating" force while the work is being created. 3) The artist must "repudiate" the intelligence behind the work and, in doing so, become carnal and concrete as if there were no reasoning at all. 4) The concrete cannot signify anything more than itself. 5) The work cannot be a consolation of the type that those who do not embrace the absurd use to create meaning in their lives and avoid the reality of death. Further, to create or not create art means nothing either way. The creator of absurd art does not prize their work, though they may repudiate it.
- Camus is not talking about the art forms of painting or music, which are already absurd, each in their own way. Painting mimics forms that exist, and music is mathematical and already operates according to observable physical laws. Camus wants to discuss the types of art that tempt the artist to offer explanations, illusions, and conclusions.
- Camus's next inquiry is whether the absurd can "hold its own" in the realm of fiction. He argues that all philosophers are also creators, using hypothetical characters, symbols, actions, and plots. Fiction also adheres to logic, reason, and intuition in the same way philosophy does. The greatest poets, essayists, and novelists intellectualize the act of making art. In other words, they aren't merely thinking and expressing—as ineffective fiction writers do—but are thinking systematically, like the philosopher, aware of what they are thinking about. However, they hide their thinking in images. "The greatest novelists are philosophical novelists," Camus says, naming Herman Melville, Franz Kafka, and Fyodor Dostoevsky as a few examples. However, many writers end up on the path to illusion, and Camus wants to understand what leads them there so that he can avoid it.
- The question Camus is most interested in is, having accepted a life without appealing to meaning/purpose/God/concepts of eternity, is it thus possible for an absurd artist to create without appeal? And if so, then, how can Camus become liberated? Absurd art must be gratuitous, as music is gratuitous, Camus says. If the art does not follow the "commandments of the absurd," if it does not "illustrate divorce and revolt," if it arouses hope and sacrifices itself to illusions, then the work ceases to be gratuitous, and therefore is not absurd art such as Camus wants. The best recourse is to stay aware and on the absurd's "middle path," creating neither "gods of light" nor "idols of mud."
- Camus ends the chapter, saying he will next examine a theme within Dostoevsky's work to determine whether the absurd is "respected" in it or if it allows "illusion" to enter.

# Part 3, Chapter 10 : Absurd Creation (Kirilov) | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- Camus examines the work of the 19th-century Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky. He notes that all of Dostoevsky's protagonists question the meaning of life. This inquiry is modern compared to a classical because it is concerned with the metaphysical rather than the moral. Camus mentions that "existence is illusory _or_ it is eternal." Camus will also end the chapter with this phrase, with a twist, having taken the whole chapter to explain what it means.
- Camus first points out three logic-based viewpoints of suicide that appear in Dostoevsky's journal, _A Writer's Diary_ (1876–77; also known as _Diary of a Writer_). Dostoevsky himself uses the phrase "logical suicide" in the journal, specifically in the installments for December 1876, as Camus notes. The three types of logic made by "the desperate man" without faith in immortality are: 1) The protagonist's consciousness tells him that happiness is harmony with "the great all." Unable to ever conceive of God, and knowing he never will, committing suicide becomes the evident choice. 2) It also follows from this perspective that a person becomes the plaintiff and defendant as well as the accused and the judge of their own life. This circumstance seems like a stupid joke played by nature, and the desperate man refuses to play along, deeming the game below him and too humiliating to play, so he commits suicide. 3) Having realized that he is indisputably the plaintiff and defendant, the accused and the judge, the desperate man thus condemns the nature that brought him into existence. By killing himself, he will also annihilate the nature that has caused him suffering. Camus dismisses all three kinds of suicide logic as being inferior to his own absurd viewpoint because the desperate character is troubled and vengeful.
- Camus moves on to show the more "superior" logic of suicide evidenced by the character Kirilov, who also advocates for logical suicide, in Dostoevsky's novel _The Possessed_ (1872). Firstly, Camus says, Kirilov wants to commit suicide because "it is his idea." Kirilov also grapples with the issue of needing God while knowing that God does not exist. This issue alone provides sufficient reason for Kirilov to kill himself. Camus sees this attitude as illustrating two of the three consequences of absurdism: freedom and revolt. Because Kirilov is asserting his independence without the need for revenge or vexation, he is an absurd character—except in that he actually kills himself, which the absurd person would not do.
- However, Camus says, the way that Kirilov explains the contradiction in himself shows that he wants to kill himself to become God. The logic Kirilov uses to reach this conclusion is absurd but necessary, Camus says: if God doesn't exist, then Kirilov is God, and to become God, he must, therefore, kill himself. Later Camus explains further that just as Nietzsche thought, Kirilov believes that to kill God is how to become God oneself, so that is why if Kirilov is God, he must kill himself—to be God. Said another way, if there is no God, then humans are responsible for everything, which makes them God. If God must be killed for humans to become their own God, then humans (who are God) must kill themselves in the end. In any case, these statements demonstrate the logic that Dostoevsky constructed for the character Kirilov in Camus's interpretation.
- Next, Camus discusses Kirilov in comparison to Christ. Unlike Christ, who is a "God-man," Kirilov is a "man-god"—just like every other human being who can be crucified and victimized—"and is to a certain degree," Camus adds. Being a god in Kirilov's context means being free on this earth, not serving an immortal being. And once Kirilov discovers this perspective along with his logic of becoming a god, he becomes a martyr for the rest of humanity, sacrificing himself so that those who come after him will be able to live like "tsars lighted up with human glory"—that is, as their own gods. Camus concludes that, indeed, Kirilov is an absurd character. And further, this theme of suicide found running through all of Dostoevsky's works is an absurd theme. And in a way, Camus says, Kirilov does die for the other characters created by Doestoevsky coming after Kirilov, such as Ivan Karamazov and others who set off "additional absurd themes." Kirilov's death liberates them, and "they try their skill at being tsars," Camus says. Their absurdism may lead them to madness, but Camus believes it is worth the risk.
- Though many of Dostoevsky's themes, judgments, and characters exemplify absurdism, Dostoevsky is not an absurd novelist, Camus declares, he is an existential novelist. In fact, even though Dostoevsky can portray "the absurd world" and its "familiar and tormenting charms," the author makes a "complete metaphysical reversal" that is easily identifiable and conclusive. The prevailing logic in Dostoevsky is that if faith in immortality is so necessary that people would otherwise kill themselves, then faith in immortality must be natural. And if faith in immortality is natural, then there must be a God and life after death. Even though Camus reassures the reader that Dostoevsky is thoroughly sincere about this metaphysical conclusion, Camus argues that it is significant that all of Dostoevsky's characters have this same suicide/absurd logic he calls a "thorn in the flesh." Also, Camus notes, Dostoevsky has pointed out that the question of God's existence has caused the author suffering his whole life long, which is something Camus sees as more evidence that anxiety is a greater influence than Dostoevsky's belief in life after death. At any rate, people with convictions, Camus says, can still feel incredulous and suffer greatly.
- "Dostoevsky makes his choice against his characters," Camus argues, pitting the creator of the works against his own imaginary characters. The world ignores Kirilov's pistol, Camus laments, and goes to back "to cherish[ing] its blind hopes."
- However, Camus admits that Dostoevsky's work is a "chiaroscuro more gripping than the light of day," able to splay out the full range of absurdist thinking even if his ultimate conclusion negates absurdism. Through looking at the character Stavrogin, Camus concludes that Dostoevsky's reversal is a kind of shame and humiliation. Dostoevsky saw the absurd path and went the other way, Camus says. Camus imagines Dostoevsky telling his character Kirilov that "existence is illusory _and_ it is eternal"—a blend of both absurdism and belief in immortality, which Camus cannot accept. Indeed, Camus began the chapter saying it must be one or the other.

# Part 3, Chapter 11 : Absurd Creation (Ephemeral Creation) | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- Camus perceives that hope cannot be avoided forever, even when the person taking the absurd path wants to be free of it. Hope can wear many disguises and creep in. Therefore, the absurd requires _ascesis_, Camus's word choice for connoting the idea of a self-discipline that is ascetic and negating.
- He argues that the absurd creator, through "negating and magnifying" only, "must give the void its colors" even while knowing that the works have no future and do not matter. The act of creation itself, combined with self-discipline, will help fulfill the absurd artist's quest to maintain awareness of the absurdity of life and overcome the phantoms of illusion—always nearer approaching "naked reality."
- The creation of art over time by an artist also adds up to something larger than its individual parts. Even while not caring if a work should be created one day and destroyed the next, the absurd artist should leave behind a body of work that is contradictory and whose pieces are in juxtaposition with each other. The non-absurd artist who repeats a single truth, in contrast, will leave behind an inferior body of work that "make[s] the air echo with the [one] sterile secret he possesses."
- The act of creating should be done in the spirit of "abandoning unity" and "glorify[ing] diversity." Absurd creation is a continuous revolt, turning the artist into a conqueror figure who shapes their own fate. And knowing that it is of no importance whether the art is created or not gives the artist more freedom and strength to bring the art to fruition. The artist who embraces the absurd will "flower in images" and "frolic in myth," a myth without any depth beyond what is mortal. The absurd artist shuns "divine fable" and produces works solely related to humanity, using a fleeting passion while summing up absurdism's "difficult wisdom."

# Part 4, Chapter 12 : The Myth of Sisyphus | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- Sisyphus is a character from Greek mythology. The gods punish him by forcing him to roll a rock to the top of a mountain, where it slides back down, and he must begin the task again—endlessly, for all eternity. For his crime, Sisyphus was accused of having stolen the gods' secrets, though stories differ as to how he became this "futile laborer of the underworld." In one version Sisyphus is punished for chaining up death, and in another he is accused of tricking the gods into letting him go back to Earth to scold his wife and refusing to return to the underworld.
- In Camus's eyes Sisyphus is an absurd hero because of his scorn for the gods, his passion for life, and his hatred of death. His punishment also reflects the absurd—that he must expend so much effort towards accomplishing, in essence, nothing.

# Part 4, Chapter 12 : The Myth of Sisyphus | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- Sisyphus is a character from Greek mythology. The gods punish him by forcing him to roll a rock to the top of a mountain, where it slides back down, and he must begin the task again—endlessly, for all eternity. For his crime, Sisyphus was accused of having stolen the gods' secrets, though stories differ as to how he became this "futile laborer of the underworld." In one version Sisyphus is punished for chaining up death, and in another he is accused of tricking the gods into letting him go back to Earth to scold his wife and refusing to return to the underworld.
- In Camus's eyes Sisyphus is an absurd hero because of his scorn for the gods, his passion for life, and his hatred of death. His punishment also reflects the absurd—that he must expend so much effort towards accomplishing, in essence, nothing.

# Quotes


1.

> There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide. 

Narrator, [Part 1, Chapter 1](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Myth-of-Sisyphus/part-1-chapter-1-summary/)

Camus poses the main problem he wishes to solve in his philosophical investigation throughout the book. Although suicide is a highly connotative word, Camus's main concern is how to judge whether life is worth living. If it is worth living, he is concerned with the illusion of meaning, and if it isn't worth living, he is concerned with how an individual might accept that futility without committing suicide.

2.

> This world I can touch, and I likewise judge that it exists. 

Narrator, [Part 1, Chapter 2](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Myth-of-Sisyphus/part-1-chapter-2-summary/)

Camus attempts to define what a person can know for certain in this world. He knows that he exists because he experiences feelings. And he knows that the world exists because he can touch things in it. Anything beyond that, however, is an illusion and beyond definition. For Camus, it is important to define these things because absurdism rejects illusion as a way of creating meaning in one's existence.

3.

> A man who has become conscious of the absurd is forever bound to it. 

Narrator, [Part 1, Chapter 3](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Myth-of-Sisyphus/part-1-chapter-3-summary/)

Camus highlights how once a person becomes aware of the absurdity of existence, they can never become unaware of it. For Camus, the absurd is understood once someone can see the "confrontation" between the need for meaning and the irrationality of the world. While some turn to religion to make sense of the world, Camus believes a true embrace of absurdity means rejecting the illusion of any religious belief.

4.

> [Life] will be lived all the better if it has no meaning. 

Narrator, [Part 1, Chapter 4](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Myth-of-Sisyphus/part-1-chapter-4-summary/)

While Camus started his philosophical inquiry into whether life had to have a meaning to be worth living, here he arrives at the conclusion that life will actually be better lived for having no meaning: to embrace absurdity is to fully live the experience of life's meaninglessness, futility, and inevitable fate of death. Here Camus begins to hint that perhaps a strange kind of peace or even happiness can be found in the absurd.

5.

> This madman is a great wise man. 

Narrator, [Part 2, Chapter 6](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Myth-of-Sisyphus/part-2-chapter-6-summary/)

Camus demonstrates how the archetypal character of Don Juan is often considered to be selfish, but really, he is the epitome of the absurd hero. Because Don Juan is concerned with the quantity of his experiences rather than the quality, he is not seeking a deeper meaning in his relationships or searching for an elusive illusion of love he believes will satisfy him. Because of this, he accepts his fate and even finds a kind of joy in it. This reasoning, to Camus, is absurd wisdom.

6.

> Never has the absurd been so well illustrated or at such length. 

Narrator, [Part 2, Chapter 7](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Myth-of-Sisyphus/part-2-chapter-7-summary/)

Here Camus highlights the absurd nature of stage actors, who create and inhabit ephemeral characters that live and die on stage. There is something in this act of self-negation and fleetingness that Camus finds representative of the absurd. Camus sees it as a kind of rebellion on the part of the actor to inhabit more than one life while accepting the fate and "death" of the character wholeheartedly.

7.

> Is an absurd work of art possible? 

Narrator, [Part 3, Chapter 9](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Myth-of-Sisyphus/part-3-chapter-9-summary/)

Camus delves into the idea of absurd creation in art and fiction. The aim of the absurd is not to explain and describe, but to experience and describe. Camus goes on to demonstrate that if the world were clear, art would not exist, because "expression begins where thought ends." In the next chapter Camus uses the example of the Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky's works to show that by investigating philosophical questions of the absurd experience, an absurd work of art is indeed possible.

8.

> If God exists, all depends on him and we can do nothing against his will. 

Narrator, [Part 3, Chapter 10](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Myth-of-Sisyphus/part-3-chapter-10-summary/)

In examining the possibility of absurd art, Camus investigates the character of Kirilov in Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel _The Possessed_. Kirilov grapples with the premise of God's existence, and Camus uses the example to highlight the absurd paradox of belief in God. Here he points out that to believe in God is to believe in fate, but if God does not exist, everything depends on the individual. Camus aligns himself with the latter belief, as it reinforces the notion of the absurd that life is meaningless.

9.

> He must give the void its colors. 

Narrator, [Part 3, Chapter 11](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Myth-of-Sisyphus/part-3-chapter-11-summary/)

Camus explores how a work of art can be considered absurd, which he believes begins in the creative attitude. The creative attitude must accept that one's creation has no future, as well as no importance or real meaning. It is the tension between negating and magnifying an experience that creates the absurd, and here Camus argues that absurd art does serve a purpose—to give the meaninglessness of existence color.

10.

> One must imagine Sisyphus happy. 

Narrator, [Part 4, Chapter 12](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Myth-of-Sisyphus/part-4-chapter-12-summary/)

> Camus tells the Greek myth of Sisyphus in which Sisyphus is condemned to push a rock up a hill for eternity, walking back down to retrieve it and roll it up again over and over. Although some might find Sisyphus's plight to be a nightmare, Camus sees him as an absurd hero who accepts his fate and also finds a kind of peace and happiness in the moments when he walks back down the hill, contemplating and approaching understanding of his predicament.

## The Wine and Bread of the Absurd

[Camus](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Myth-of-Sisyphus/author/) argues against embracing religious notions of God and the possibility of future immortality in an eternal afterlife throughout _The Myth of Sisyphus_. He uses many religious images and concepts as he builds his argument for absurdism. However, Camus turns religious concepts upside-down and infuses them with verbal irony. He posits that religion is a "temptation" that the absurd person must recognize and avoid, that to embrace absurdism offers "virginal brightness," and that at its core, the secret of absurdism is a kind of "purity," to give just a few examples. But the most significant of these occurs when Camus refers to the "wine of the absurd" and "the bread of indifference" in [Part 1, Chapter 4](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Myth-of-Sisyphus/part-1-chapter-4-summary/). In this chapter Camus is explaining to the reader that longing for immortality and God is something that all people feel. Yet there is no God or immortality—at least no certainty of it—and to face this fact will offer a transformation greater than what religion offers. Wine and bread in the Christian sacrament of Communion symbolize the body of Christ and a union between the adherent and God. Taking Communion represents being enlivened by the Holy Spirit and transformed by it. Drinking and eating Camus's symbolic absurd wine and bread will "transfigure" the person who adopts the absurdist philosophy similarly with the religious experience but in the opposite way. The absurdist will be able to accept the reality that there is no God, no life after death, and will, therefore, become a clearer thinker who is free to embrace earthly life and live it to the fullest without guilt, remorse, or illusions.

## The Crest

[Camus](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Myth-of-Sisyphus/author/) wants his readers to see how each of the writers and philosophers he discusses in _The Myth of Sisyphus_, except for Nietzsche, ultimately takes a mental leap toward either religion or the negation of life that he calls despair or philosophical suicide. Camus is arguing that life is better when people stay on what he calls "the crest" and don't leap at all. In fact, he defines integrity as being able to "remain on that dizzying crest." Allowing any belief in the afterlife or God is an illusion, "subterfuge," that consoles but robs life of its reality, weight, and vitality. Even though life is essentially meaningless to Camus, staying on the crest enables a person to experience all they can in great quantities and diversity until their time is up. The imagery that accompanies Camus's symbol is fitting: a person standing precariously at the topmost ridge of a mountain, right on the edge, called to jump into the false consolation of religion or to commit philosophical suicide. Camus suggests people live right on that edge, fully aware of the absurdity of life and its danger—the looming death that will eventually come.

# Biography

### Early Life and Influences

Albert Camus was born in Mondovi (now Dréan), Algeria, on November 7, 1913. Algeria, in North Africa, was at the time under French rule, which lasted from 1830 to 1962. His father, Lucien Auguste Camus (b. 1885–1914), who earned a modest salary working at a vineyard, enlisted in the French military during World War I (1914–18). He died on October 11, 1914, from wounds suffered at the Battle of Marne. Albert had not yet celebrated his first birthday. Soon after, Albert moved with his mother and elder brother to a two-room apartment located in a poor district of Algiers, where they lived with Albert's maternal grandmother. The grandmother was domineering and often used cruel disciplinary methods, such as a whip made from a bull ligament.

Camus's mother and grandmother were both illiterate. However, a teacher named Louis Germain recognized young Albert's intelligence and tutored him in preparation for a scholarship. In 1923 Camus won a scholarship that enabled him to attend the high school in Algiers. There, he flourished as a student and also enjoyed playing sports, especially soccer. However, in 1930, Camus was stricken with attacks of tuberculosis. Because of the fear that he might infect others, Camus was forced to leave school and home. He went to live with his uncle, who was a successful butcher, and his aunt. Under their care, he recovered enough to return to school. However, Camus dealt with attacks of tuberculosis throughout the rest of his life.

After graduating from high school, Camus attended the University of Algiers, where he majored in philosophy. Under the guidance of writer and professor Jean Grenier (1898–1971), Camus devoured French classics by authors like André Malraux (1901–76) and André Gide (1869–1951). Malraux often wrote novels that focused on the complexities and ambiguities of revolutionary action and political idealism. Gide was a writer and critic of conventional morality who emphasized the honesty and self-awareness of the individual and praised the notion of the individual liberating himself "from family, tradition and morality," in the words of Camus biographer Patrick McCarthy. Also at the university, Camus became interested in theater and wrote and acted in several plays.

### Writing Career

In the mid-1930s, Camus joined the Communist Party, but he never felt comfortable with this group. For example, communists downplayed opposition to French colonial rule in an effort to win France's support of the Soviet Union; Camus believed in French rule of Algeria but was critical of the government. In 1937 Camus was expelled from the Communist Party and traveled with friends to Paris. During this trip, Camus expressed feeling a "nameless fear," which often struck him when traveling. Upon returning to Algiers, Camus accepted a job doing boring office work for a meteorology institute.

Soon he was hired to write editorials and literary articles for a leftist paper called _Alger-R_é_publicain_. Many of these articles focused on the travesties of the legal system and the inhumane treatment and humiliation of social outcasts and impoverished people. When World War II (1939–45) broke out, Camus took the unusual position of being against both Soviet leader Joseph Stalin (1878–1953), who favored a strong France, and German dictator Adolf Hitler (1889–1945), who later invaded France. Despite having signed the German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact in 1939, the two dictators had different motives for signing the pact. Stalin signed to gain the time he needed to build up his military, while Hitler signed so he could invade Poland unchecked. The pact would end when Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941. Around this time, Camus began working on an essay called "The Myth of Sisyphus," which posed the absurdist view that life has no ultimate meaning and humans must live with an understanding of this void. He also began working on an absurdist novel: _The Stranger,_ which is thematically linked to the absurdist philosophy discussed in the essay.

Camus worked tirelessly on the novel. Apparently, Camus based the character of Meursault on one of his girlfriend's brothers. Meursault is not at all like Camus in that the character seems to have no goals and never analyzes himself. In contrast, Camus had a strong ambition to be a successful writer and was plagued with anxieties and self-doubt. _The Stranger_ reflects Malraux's and Gides's influence on Camus. Malraux's interest in the ambiguities of political idealism is illustrated in the courtroom chapters where the legal system and the Church attempt to instill their ideals in Meursault. Gide's emphasis on individual honesty is illustrated in Meursault's refusal to lie. Camus also used his experience doing dull work for the meteorology institute as a basis for Meursault's work handling freight invoices.

After _The Stranger_ was published during World War II in 1942, it received huge critical acclaim. Camus was accepted into France's intellectual community, which included the existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre (1905–80). The two men would famously split in 1952 over the Cold War between East and West. Camus rejected the justification of violence to remake the world, as was practiced by the Soviet Union and which was central to the political atmosphere in the years leading up to the War of Independence in Algeria (1954–62) by those opposed to colonialism.

During World War II, Camus wrote for _Combat,_ the main intellectual vehicle for the French Resistance. After the war, he went on to write works that have come to be regarded as classics of French literature, including the novels _The Plague_ (1947) and _The Fall_ (1956), and the essay "The Rebel" (1951). In 1957 Camus won the Nobel Prize for Literature.

### Death and Legacy

On January 4, 1960, Camus lost his life in a car accident. Over the course of the remaining century, his work remained influential in the study of literature, philosophy, and politics. In his eulogy for Camus, fellow philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre labeled him a stubborn humanist. Unlike other philosophers of the 20th century, Camus was more interested in intuition than investigating the truth of opinions, and his ideas went on to inspire many of the broad New Left political movement during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. These Western activists, intellectuals, young radicals, and independent socialists admired Camus's aesthetics and style and his political focus on ethics and human rights. His popularity resurged again in the 1990s when the collapse of communism shifted philosophical concerns away from hard-line political ideology and toward questions of dialogue and human rights.
