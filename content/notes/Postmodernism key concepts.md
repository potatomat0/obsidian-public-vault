**postmodernism**, also spelled **post-modernism**, in [Western philosophy](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Western-philosophy), a late 20th-century movement characterized by broad [skepticism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/skepticism), subjectivism, or relativism; a general suspicion of [reason](https://www.britannica.com/topic/reason); and an [acute](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/acute) sensitivity to the role of [ideology](https://www.britannica.com/topic/ideology-society) in asserting and maintaining political and economic power.

## Postmodernism and modern philosophy

Postmodernism is largely a reaction against the [intellectual](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intellectual) assumptions and values of the modern period in the [history](https://www.britannica.com/topic/history) of Western philosophy (roughly, the 17th through the 19th century). Indeed, many of the doctrines characteristically associated with postmodernism can fairly be described as the straightforward denial of general philosophical viewpoints that were taken for granted during the 18th-century [Enlightenment](https://www.britannica.com/event/Enlightenment-European-history), though they were not unique to that period. The most important of these viewpoints are the following.

1. There is an objective natural reality, a reality whose [existence](https://www.britannica.com/topic/existence) and properties are logically independent of human beings—of their minds, their societies, their social practices, or their investigative techniques. Postmodernists dismiss this idea as a kind of naive [realism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/realism-philosophy). Such reality as there is, according to postmodernists, is a [conceptual](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conceptual) construct, an [artifact](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/artifact) of scientific practice and [language](https://www.britannica.com/topic/language). This point also applies to the investigation of past events by historians and to the description of social institutions, structures, or practices by social scientists.

2. The descriptive and explanatory statements of scientists and historians can, in principle, be objectively true or false. The postmodern denial of this viewpoint—which follows from the rejection of an objective natural reality—is sometimes expressed by saying that there is no such thing as Truth.

3. Through the use of reason and [logic](https://www.britannica.com/topic/logic), and with the more specialized tools provided by [science](https://www.britannica.com/science/history-of-science) and [technology](https://www.britannica.com/technology/history-of-technology), human beings are likely to change themselves and their societies for the better. It is reasonable to expect that future societies will be more humane, more just, more [enlightened](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/enlightened), and more prosperous than they are now. Postmodernists deny this Enlightenment faith in science and technology as instruments of human progress. Indeed, many postmodernists hold that the misguided (or unguided) pursuit of scientific and technological knowledge led to the development of technologies for killing on a massive scale in [World War II](https://www.britannica.com/event/World-War-II). Some go so far as to say that science and technology—and even reason and logic—are inherently destructive and oppressive, because they have been used by evil people, especially during the 20th century, to destroy and oppress others.

4. Reason and logic are universally valid—i.e., their laws are the same for, or apply equally to, any thinker and any domain of knowledge. For postmodernists, reason and logic too are merely conceptual constructs and are therefore valid only within the established intellectual traditions in which they are used.

5. There is such a thing as human nature; it consists of faculties, aptitudes, or [dispositions](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dispositions) that are in some sense present in human beings at birth rather than learned or instilled through social forces. Postmodernists insist that all, or nearly all, aspects of human [psychology](https://www.britannica.com/science/psychology) are completely socially determined.

6. [Language](https://www.britannica.com/topic/language) refers to and represents a reality outside itself. According to postmodernists, language is not such a “mirror of nature,” as the American [pragmatist](https://www.britannica.com/topic/pragmatism-philosophy) philosopher [Richard Rorty](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Richard-Rorty) characterized the Enlightenment view. Inspired by the work of the Swiss linguist [Ferdinand de Saussure](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ferdinand-de-Saussure), postmodernists claim that language is semantically self-contained, or self-referential: the meaning of a word is not a static thing in the world or even an idea in the mind but rather a range of contrasts and differences with the meanings of other words. Because meanings are in this sense functions of other meanings—which themselves are functions of other meanings, and so on—they are never fully “present” to the speaker or hearer but are endlessly “deferred.” Self-reference characterizes not only natural languages but also the more specialized “discourses” of particular [communities](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/communities) or traditions; such discourses are embedded in social practices and reflect the conceptual schemes and [moral](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/moral) and intellectual values of the [community](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/community) or tradition in which they are used. The postmodern view of language and discourse is due largely to the French philosopher and literary theorist [Jacques Derrida](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jacques-Derrida) (1930–2004), the originator and leading practitioner of [deconstruction](https://www.britannica.com/topic/deconstruction).

7. Human beings can acquire knowledge about natural reality, and this knowledge can be justified ultimately on the basis of evidence or principles that are, or can be, known immediately, intuitively, or otherwise with certainty. Postmodernists reject philosophical foundationalism—the attempt, perhaps best exemplified by the 17th-century French philosopher [René Descartes](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Rene-Descartes)’s dictum [cogito, ergo sum](https://www.britannica.com/topic/cogito-ergo-sum) (“I think, therefore I am”), to identify a foundation of certainty on which to build the edifice of [empirical](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/empirical) (including scientific) knowledge.

8. It is possible, at least in principle, to construct general theories that explain many aspects of the natural or social world within a given domain of knowledge—e.g., a general theory of human history, such as [dialectical materialism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/dialectical-materialism). Furthermore, it should be a goal of scientific and historical research to construct such theories, even if they are never perfectly attainable in practice. Postmodernists dismiss this notion as a pipe dream and indeed as symptomatic of an unhealthy tendency within [Enlightenment](https://www.britannica.com/event/Enlightenment-European-history) discourses to adopt “totalizing” systems of thought (as the French philosopher [Emmanuel Lévinas](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Emmanuel-Levinas) called them) or grand “metanarratives” of human biological, historical, and [social development](https://www.britannica.com/science/social-learning) (as the French philosopher [Jean-François Lyotard](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jean-Francois-Lyotard) claimed). These theories are [pernicious](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pernicious) not merely because they are false but because they effectively impose conformity on other perspectives or discourses, thereby oppressing, [marginalizing](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/marginalizing), or silencing them. Derrida himself equated the theoretical tendency toward totality with [totalitarianism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/totalitarianism).

# Postmodernism and [relativism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/relativism)

As indicated in the preceding section, many of the characteristic doctrines of postmodernism [constitute](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/constitute) or imply some form of [metaphysical](https://www.britannica.com/topic/metaphysics), [epistemological](https://www.britannica.com/topic/epistemology), or [ethical relativism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/ethical-relativism). (It should be noted, however, that some postmodernists vehemently reject the relativist label.) Postmodernists deny that there are aspects of reality that are objective; that there are statements about reality that are objectively true or false; that it is possible to have knowledge of such statements (objective knowledge); that it is possible for human beings to know some things with certainty; and that there are objective, or absolute, [moral](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/moral) values. Reality, knowledge, and value are constructed by discourses; hence they can vary with them. This means that the discourse of modern [science](https://www.britannica.com/science/science), when considered apart from the evidential standards internal to it, has no greater purchase on the [truth](https://www.britannica.com/topic/truth-philosophy-and-logic) than do [alternative](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/alternative) perspectives, including (for example) [astrology](https://www.britannica.com/topic/astrology) and [witchcraft](https://www.britannica.com/topic/witchcraft). Postmodernists sometimes characterize the evidential standards of science, including the use of reason and [logic](https://www.britannica.com/topic/logic), as “Enlightenment rationality.”

The broad relativism apparently so characteristic of postmodernism invites a certain line of thinking regarding the nature and function of discourses of different kinds. If postmodernists are correct that reality, knowledge, and value are relative to discourse, then the established discourses of the [Enlightenment](https://www.britannica.com/event/Enlightenment-European-history) are no more necessary or justified than alternative discourses. But this raises the question of how they came to be established in the first place. If it is never possible to evaluate a discourse according to whether it leads to objective Truth, how did the established discourses become part of the prevailing worldview of the modern era? Why were these discourses adopted or developed, whereas others were not?

[![Michel Foucault](https://cdn.britannica.com/88/61988-050-CF52C93A/Paul-Michel-Foucault.jpg?w=300)](https://cdn.britannica.com/88/61988-050-CF52C93A/Paul-Michel-Foucault.jpg)

Part of the postmodern answer is that the prevailing discourses in any society reflect the interests and values, broadly speaking, of dominant or elite groups. Postmodernists disagree about the nature of this connection; whereas some apparently [endorse](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/endorse) the dictum of the German philosopher and economist [Karl Marx](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Karl-Marx) that “the ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of its ruling class,” others are more [circumspect](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/circumspect). Inspired by the historical research of the French philosopher [Michel Foucault](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michel-Foucault), some postmodernists defend the comparatively [nuanced](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nuanced) view that what counts as knowledge in a given era is always influenced, in complex and subtle ways, by considerations of power. There are others, however, who are willing to go even further than Marx. The French philosopher and literary theorist [Luce Irigaray](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Luce-Irigaray), for example, has argued that the science of solid [mechanics](https://www.britannica.com/science/mechanics) is better developed than the science of [fluid mechanics](https://www.britannica.com/science/fluid-mechanics) because the male-dominated institution of [physics](https://www.britannica.com/science/physics-science) associates solidity and fluidity with the male and female sex organs, respectively. Similarly, the Bulgarian-born French psychoanalyst and writer [Julia Kristeva](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Julia-Kristeva) has faulted modern [linguistics](https://www.britannica.com/science/linguistics) for privileging aspects of language associated, in her psychoanalytic theory, with the paternal or paternal authority (rule systems and referential meaning) over aspects associated with the maternal and the body (rhythm, tone, and other poetic elements).

Because the established discourses of the Enlightenment are more or less arbitrary and unjustified, they can be changed; and because they more or less reflect the interests and values of the powerful, they _should_ be changed. Thus postmodernists regard their theoretical position as uniquely [inclusive](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/inclusive) and democratic, because it allows them to recognize the unjust [hegemony](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hegemony) of Enlightenment discourses over the equally valid perspectives of nonelite groups. In the 1980s and ’90s, academic advocates on behalf of various ethnic, cultural, racial, and religious groups embraced postmodern [critiques](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/critiques) of contemporary Western society, and postmodernism became the unofficial [philosophy](https://www.britannica.com/topic/philosophy) of the new movement of “[identity politics](https://www.britannica.com/topic/identity-politics).”
