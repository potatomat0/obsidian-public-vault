## 100 Philosophy and Human Values (1990)


[**Philosophy and Human Values (1990)**](http://rickroderick.org/category/philosophy-and-human-values/)  
Rick Roderick, Ph. D.  
  
[Lecture One: Socrates and the Life of Inquiry](http://rickroderick.org/101-socrates-and-the-life-of-inquiry-1990/)

1. The trial and death of Socrates inaugurated the Western philosophical tradition.
    1. Investigation turned from movement of stars and composition of the earth toward human matters by separating scientific from philosophic discourse.
    2. Dialogic form posits dialogue as essential to knowledge.
    3. It is essential to have knowledge of oneself.
2. Socrates had an argument against relativism.
    1. Is the idea that truth is relative itself a relative truth — or is it an absolute one?
    2. Human Meaning:
        1. What are you doing — now, and in life?
        2. Do meanings transcend the here and now?
        3. When a term or set of terms that are very important to a society (e.g. “virtue”, “patriotism”) are questioned, society is in danger. This was true of Socrates’ Athens and of our condition.
        4. Several themes are pursued throughout the lectures.
    3. Ask and try to localize in history what it means to be a human being.
    4. Explore ways of living, including the socratic way of critical inquiry.
    5. The “fallibilist” philosophy is believing passionately in certain things but realizing that the beliefs may be wrong.
    6. This type of critical inquiry, if it can be carried out at all, can be carried out when societies are troubled and the meanings of words are debated and redefined.
        1. The way we describe and understand our lives is inextricably connected to the way we live them.
        2. Under these conditions it may not be possible to expand localized useful definitions.

[Lecture Two: Epicureans, Stoics, Skeptics](http://rickroderick.org/102-epicureans-stoics-skeptics-1990/)

1. Conflicting ideals of excellence in Roman Society.
    1. Hedonism is doing what makes you happy.
        1. Epicureans pursued higher pleasures in moderation.
        2. It is associated with a rising empire and its values.
    2. Stoicism involved fortitude and cultivating apathy to difficulties of life.
        1. Happiness was the best thing, but was unattainable.
        2. It is associated with a falling empire and its values.
    3. Christianity is a slow ascension, based on Stoic thought.
        1. It is spread through the spoken word and fire of the sword.
        2. There is a hierarchical society arranged with differential relations to God.
        3. It offers solace to the inevitability of human suffering in a way that the Stoics did not.
2. A brief note on modern criticism of democracy:
    1. Max Weber said quantitative relations are more important than qualitative where rules and procedures are followed.
    2. Franz Kafka was also a critic of democracy.
3. Anselm’s argument for the existence of God:
    1. This is an argument between only two interlocutors. If you are neither the fool who has said there is no God, or the believer, this argument has no bearing on you.
    2. God is defined as a being, greater than which cannot be conceived.
        1. It is greater to exist in the mind and reality than in the mind alone. Therefore, God must exist in reality because if he did not, we could conceive something greater.
        2. This is perhaps one of the most eloquent arguments in philosophy.

[Lecture Three: Kant and the Path to Enlightenment](http://rickroderick.org/103-kant-and-the-path-to-enlightenment-1990/)

1. Modernity began after the French Revolution.
    1. Max Weber’s understanding of modernity includes notions of bureaucracy, the state, and the rationalization of modern life.
    2. Before modernity, humans were defined as collected atoms.
    3. After the Revolution, authority was seen as that of the autonomous individual. Autonomy became central to ethical decisions.
2. In Kant’s ethical theory, individuals judge their actions as right or wrong.
    1. Kant presupposes that there is a moral law.
    2. He begins with a series of identifications to answer how the moral law possibly gives a pure abstract form of a moral law that will ask if it is really moral.
3. Kant’s categorical imperative gives a single moral rule general enough to cover the ten commandments and the golden rule and exclude all that won’t fit those kinds of patterns.
    1. Act so you can will the rule” of your action to be a universal law.
    2. It is an imperative because it is a command, and it is categorical because it is not hypothetical.
4. Kant drew principles from the categorical imperative.
    1. Always treat others and yourself as though you were an end and never a mere means.
    2. Always act under the practical postulate that our will is free.
    3. Always act so you can regard your own will as making universal law and be willing for everyone else to act just as you did.
    4. Human capacity to be a moral agent gives each human dignity.
5. The “kingdom of ends” is where all of us in our mutual relations with one another treat each other as ends and not as mere means.
6. Mill (utilitarianism) vs. Kant (Deontology):
    1. Mill argued we should always act so as to bring the greatest happiness to the greatest number.
    2. Kant argues we should act as if our actions are universal.
    3. Both of these theories ignore actual lives and complexities of ethnic, gender and class relations.

[Lecture Four: Mill on Liberty](http://rickroderick.org/104-mill-on-liberty-1990/)

1. Another objection to Kant is the question of what happens when you are trying to will a universal principle in a situation when two principles are good and yet you cannot do them both.
    1. It is not just right or wrong. You must chose the one that leads to the best results.
    2. In an embodied context it may not do a bit of good to know the rule, illustrating that the moral life is full of ambiguity.
2. Freedom in the 19th Century is addressed by Mill’s commentary on liberty.
    1. Mill tries to show where the grounds are for the government’s interference: with our liberty, a question of legitimacy, not of power.
    2. The harm principle posits that the only legitimate ground for social coercion is to prevent harm to others. Once you give this power up, it is over.
    3. The offense principle, which Mill would not support, posits society has a legitimate right to socially coerce to prevent “offending” others. Such offense undermines the moral tone of society.
    4. One must make a distinction between self-regarding actions and other-regarding actions in the harm principle. (Some argue that there is no such thing as a self-regarding action.)
    5. The principle of paternalism is that we can interfere with people for their own good.
    6. An added dimensions of the harm principle: social coercion can be used if decisions are encumbered by craziness, drunkeness of if freedoms of others are interfered with.
3. There are limitations to Mill’s account of freedom.
    1. It is an account of “negative freedom” only, a freedom from constraint.
    2. He says nothing about positive freedom to act.
4. Hegel argues that freedom is the meaning and the point of human history in general. Overcoming obstacles is gaining freedom.
    1. The challenge of freedom is to find the new boundaries and then to figure out how to break them down.
    2. Marx wrote that philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways. The point is to change it.

[Lecture Five: Hegel and Modern Life](http://rickroderick.org/105-hegel-and-modern-life-1990/)

1. Hegel was conservative.
    1. The culmination of this long historical process is that history proper came to an end.
    2. Right wing Hegelians took Hegel to be fundamentally right and therefore applied his method over and over.
    3. To left wing Hegelians such as Marx Hegel’s is a classic text but has an ambiguous legacy.
2. Marx criticized capitalism.
    1. A criticism of capitalism is a criticism of Hegel because for Hegel, capitalism coupled with liberal democracy is the highest achievement of humanity.
    2. The democratic state is in contradiction with the imperatives of the capitalist economy.
        1. We are used to these contradiction in our current society. This was not true in Marx’s time.
        2. The secret of capitalism is the shift in identity from what you are in a society to what you own or have.
    3. Marx identified several effects of capitalism.
        1. It reduces human needs to those which can be bought and sold in the market place.
        2. It produces from nature more technological abilities than in all of history.
        3. These come into contradiction because of the imperative of the economy to make a profit and to fulfill nil these new needs.
3. Marx’s ideology:
    1. If you really want to know how someone thinks, look at their surroundings. This outlook, “materialism,” criticized ideas by examining.
    2. Moral or philosophical clilemnas must be understood in terms of being different for different classes.
    3. There is a difference between a theoretical approach and an approach rooted in daily life.
    4. You must not let your life be reduced to poverty or work.
    5. Before moral problems arise, there are preconditions for human life that have to be fulfilled such as food, shelter, health care and freedom to pursue other goals besides work.

[Lecture Six: Nietzsche: Knowledge and Belief](http://rickroderick.org/106-nietzsche-knowledge-and-belief-1990/)

1. There are no water-tight distinctions between philosophy and politics.
    1. The priority of politics is marked even in the Greeks.
    2. These set the necessary conditions within which human beings can pursue things, such as a good life for themselves.
    3. There is a severe problem with the writings of Marx.
        1. He assumed that workers shaping and forming their own modes of work would not fall victim to the power of the state.
        2. The state would step in place of a capitalist class and exploit their labor.
    4. The process of a world becoming bureaucratically more complex and intrusive at the level of the state is a world phenomenon, and is not localizeable.
2. Nietzsche was a critic of modernity.
    1. Nietzsche held the view that knowledge is a form of power, which was the subject of his most important book, From Where Do Distinctions Come?
    2. He speaks of the Greeks’ understanding of virtue, vastly different from our own.
        1. They knew who and when to con.
        2. Excellence was multi-dimensional and honored a fully developed person, not a proficient functionary.
    3. He gives us a genealogy of our uses of words.
    4. Eternal problems change radically depending on where you happen to be in history.
    5. Knowledge, truth, and objectivity, good and bad, have conditions for possibility and these conditions change.
3. Nietzsche criticizes Christianity.
    1. He suggests that Christianity inculcates us in bad reading.
    2. Superficially, beneath the Old Testament’s doctrine of love and compassion is submerged a doctrine of resentment and hatred.
    3. He argues that love is meaningless without discrimination.
    4. He criticizes Christianity’s distinction between earthly and carnal kinds of love.

[Lecture Seven: Kierkegaard and the Contemporary Spirit](http://rickroderick.org/107-kierkegaard-and-the-contemporary-spirit-1990/)

1. A recap of Nietzsche:
    1. Power is inter I wined with things which are not dependent on power, such as truth and goodness.
    2. The Greeks were straight-forward with their idea of virtue. It was based on excellence and the fulfillment of human powers.
    3. Christian morality grew out of a slave context. Its doctrines of love and compassion were tooted in resentment of a power that could not express itself.
2. God is “dead.”
3. Kierkegaard
    1. In a place where all arc Christians, ipso facto, none are Christians.
    2. Kierkegaard did not believe that each one of us are individual subjects some how separated from each other like monads.
4. The Sickness Onto Death:
    1. Kierkegaard argues that psychology is in principle impossible.
    2. The self is not a substantial thing but a deep relation, and it’s not even that relation but the relating of relations.
        1. We are a synthesis between our desire for freedom and our recognition of brutal necessity.
        2. Because we are a relation, we are incomplete.
        3. This despair constitutes the self.
    3. Kierkegaard describes a morally ill person who is struggling with death yet does not die. (sick onto death)
    4. The hope is to find a way to die.
        1. Suicide is not acceptable.
        2. Despair is the reaction to the struggle to be human in inhuman conditions.
5. The relation to human values and social systems:
    1. The 19th century story was the replacement of manual labor with machine labor, while the 20th century story will be the replacement of intellectual labor with machine labor.
    2. Humans driven to this extent of socialization would greatly prefer death but are unable to do it,
    3. In the postmodern culture, images are more real than the real thing, and patriotism is cynical.
    4. Things no longer look like human values but rather human commodities.

[Lecture Eight: Philosophy and Postmodern Culture](http://rickroderick.org/108-philosophy-and-post-modern-culture-1990/)

1. A recap of the lecture series:
    1. Retrace the history of the accounts of human values given in Western Philosophy, and you’ll probably find a dead end with some rather ordinary philosophic problems.
    2. Hegel reminds us that human values and moral and ethical problems arise in historical circumstances.
    3. Society and history has to do with economics and the state.
    4. Culture is less systematic. A culture based on spectacle and images has a peculiar nonsystematic character.
2. Freud outlines the process of economic building with cultural unawareness.
    1. The conscious mind is a very small part of our psychic life.
    2. Freud’s goal was for the unconscious (id) to become the conscious (ego).
    3. Mass culture turns the conscious to unconscious.
    4. We can tune out the culture, however, we cannot destroy it.
3. Civilisation can be seen as a drama between eros (love) and thanatos (death).
    1. The mechanism of one side has clearly gained the upper hand (thanatos).
        1. However, eternal eros might come in and strike a blow for the other side.
        2. This is about to be a global situation that will be difficult to solve because there are no concrete walls.
    2. We must reinject resistance into or at least put up a simulation of resistance to it.
        1. The worst thing we can do is to be unanimously for something.
        2. We have not yet written the last obituary for radical democracy.
    3. St. Paul’s answer is in Corinthians. It is a masterpiece of sophistry, rhetoric and bitter invective.
    4. Philosophy is disconsolate in principle.
        1. Hegel said dialectics or philosophy does not run from detestation but tarries with it awhile and looks it in its face.
        2. The structural principles of our society are as barbaric in their structure as they ever were, perhaps more so.

SUGGESTED READING TO ACCOMPANY Philosophy and Human Values  
Plato’s “Meno” – perhaps the classic Socratic dialogue. The topic is can “excellence” (virtue) be taught. Both in style and content, this is a founding document of Western self-understanding.  
Mill’s “On Liberty” – a brilliant defense of what Isiah Berlin calls “negative freedom”, namely the right of the individual to be free from stale coercion.  
Kierkegaard’s “The Sickness Unto Death” – a fascinating challenge to our various projects of achieving authentic selfhood, written in a difficult but beautifully ironic style.  
Freud’s “Civilization and Its Discontents” – a dramatic work of incredible sweep, it presents a powerful dialectic of the development of human beings.  
Nietzsche’s “On the Geneaology of Morals” – a devastating attack on traditional morality and moral theories, this work offers a kind of gateway to the most recent debates on” modernity and postmodernity.  
Hegel’s “Reason in History” – a classic statement of the Western understanding of the role of human beings in the development of the modern world.

## 200 Guide: Nietzsche and the Postmodern Condition (1991)

[**Nietzsche and the Postmodern Condition (1991)**](http://rickroderick.org/category/nietzsche-and-the-postmodern-condition)

    5. Nietzsche went mad ten years before his death.
3. There are several sets of paradoxes that concern Nietzsche as myth and mythmaker
    1. The first set is in his writings. For example, Nietzsche suggests that morality has an "immoral" origin.
    2. The second set of paradoxes in generated by his writing, specifically, the impossibility of constructing the right interpretation of any text, including Nietzsche’s.
        1. Interpretation takes place in all realms of society.
        2. The are stakes in interpretation.
        3. Nietzsche finds interpretations multiple and contestable.
        4. Nietzsche suggest that methodological languages substantiate institutional powers.

[Lecture Two: Nietzsche on Truth and Lie](http://rickroderick.org/202-nietzsche-on-truth-and-lie-1991/)

1. Nietzsche was accused of being a Relativist.
    1. His view of the function of truth and lie was mislabeled as perspectivism, which no one really believes in.
    2. Nietzsche was opposed to the dogmatism inherent in the Western theoretical tradition.
    3. Nietzsche believed that binding everyone to one view is bad, and that all views are not equally good or interesting.
    4. It’s consistent to believe in something passionately, and also to believe that this belief may be wrong.
    5. Nietzsche respected Socrates, but Socrates wanted an answer to the question, "What is X?" Any answer would be dogmatic.
    6. This dogmatic tradition is imperialistic and breeds conformity.
2. The standard philosophical refutation of relativism:
    1. The relativist can’t state a position – because this implies "truth" which is what they’re trying to refute.
    2. This is a self-referencial paradox.
3. The current theory of truth is redundant and deflationary: "Truth is what is the case."
4. Nietzsche’s theory of truth comes from "On Truth and Lie".
    1. "In short, it’s a sum of human relations which has been enhanced, transposed, and embellished poetically and rhetorically, and which after long use seem firm, canonical, and obligatory to a people"
    2. "Truths are illusions" about which one has forgotten that is what they are.
    3. Truth is "mutually agreed upon fictions".
    4. The statement that "the U.S. is a democracy" is such a truth.

5. Nietzsche’s text is filled with virulent sexism.
    1. Nietzsche asked – what if truth turned out to be a woman?
    2. What if gossip and not philosophy has held the world together?
6. Nietzsche denied that facts can determine our interpretations.
    1. For example, creationists won’t be persuaded by bare facts because interpretations determine what is fact.
    2. Certain interpretations are overused and lose their usefulness.
    3. "Human beings are in love with what vanishes."

[Lecture Three: Nietzsche as Master of Suspicion and Immoralist](http://rickroderick.org/203-nietzsche-as-master-of-suspicion-and-immoralist-1991/)

1. Nietzsche was a master of suspicion.
    1. Nietzsche writes in various styles such as fragments and aphorism making it hard to know what to interpret.
    2. What is style in writing? It’s a writer finding his/her voice.
    3. Nietzsche’s styles open the problem of interpretation
        1. If there is style, there must be more than one.
        2. Style is only style to the extent to which we can differentiate it from another style.
2. The method of Nietzsche’s genealogy.
    1. A genealogy attempts to uncover the formations of an entire discursive practice.
    2. Genealogy attempts a reversal of perspective.
    3. It is distinguished from Marxism and other kinds of history writings because it doesn’t look for a singular subject or collective subjects. Instead it looks for micrological power (force to force).
    4. The truth of such accounts are the accuracy of their interpretations as a kind of choice one has made.
3. Nietzsche’s argument on the genealogy of morals:
    1. Nietzsche want’s to trace the origins of our values.
    2. The procedure he follows makes use of modes forms psychological and historical reasoning, and studying the texts that we’ve structured out understanding of "whole bodies" on.
    3. the schema: Our morality which grew out of religion, (Christianity).
    4. Nietzsche sees civilization headed toward a dead-end.
    5. In The Genealogy of Morals, these is an invidious binary in the text: master and slave morality. He identifies master morality with Greek ideals and slave morality with Christian.
4. Nietzsche’s background as a philologist warned him that words underwent semantic shifts between the Greek and Christian periods.
    1. The Greek word for excellence is translated as virtue or piety in the Christian period.
    2. Odysseus was honored in Greek society. He was well rounded and had "active powers". Nietzsche called these noble values.
    3. Nietzsche argues that the transformation of these values was life denying.
    4. Nietzsche didn’t think this was entirely negative because he thought it made the human race more subtle and devious.

[Lecture Four: The Death of God](http://rickroderick.org/204-nietzsche-the-death-of-god-1991/)

1. Nietzsche looks to see what type of person makes particular arguments or evaluations.
2. Greek values are noble but naive.
    1. Active force prevails over reactive forces (things that stand over the human will).
    2. The active type is noted for its ability to forget.
        1. "Mirror historicism" involves people who wander idly through relics of the past.
        2. Memory is needed in Christianity for things like the redemption story.
3. In Christian morality, reactive forces prevail over the active ones.
    1. Principles stand in the way of what you want.
    2. Christian achievements have always had some opposite perverse nature.
    3. The denial of power eroticizes the world in a brand new way.
    4. Sin is what Nietzsche thought was interesting about Christianity.
    5. The weak revenged themselves on the strong..
    6. In the Bible, the Devil introduces interpretation.
    7. Nietzsche does not deny the power of Christianity.
    8. Reactive forces endanger the species.
    9. Resentment and guilt are fundamental to the substructure of Christian discourse.
4. The spectre of nihilism:
    1. The aesthetic ideal expresses a will to nothingness (in the decadent period of Christianity).
    2. The problem in Christianity is not finding believers, but finding real people.
5. Nietzsche’s parable of the death of God:
    1. The parable talks about the drying up of a horizon of meaning and of a while form of human life.
    2. The parable from "The Gay Science" ("The Madmen") claims that we are responsible for God’s death.
    3. How shall we comfort ourselves now?
    4. What are churches if not the tombs of God?

[Lecture Five: The Eternal Recurrence](http://rickroderick.org/205-nietzsche-the-eternal-recurrence-1991/)

1. Nietzsche invested himself as a character who would stand out above the text – an act of self creation.
2. There is a sociological dimension to the "death of God" parable.
    1. The death of God is a metaphor that signals something that’s perhaps still on it’s way. (It has yet to be understood in full.)
    2. Society has changed in such a way that it is difficult to be religious. (Weber called this the disenchantment of the world.)
3. Nietzsche is known as the teacher of the eternal recurrence.
    1. He’s reluctant to give didactic answers because he’s too decadent (born between two worlds).
    2. Eternal recurrence is a challenge to self creation.
    3. Nietzsche asks a horrifying question: what if everything that occurred – occurred again – just as it happened before?
    4. Ate you leading the kind of life that you’d be willing to live over again and again?
    5. The challenge is to live an interesting life.
    6. Nietzsche has more in mind than just changing jobs.
    7. He uses a myth because of his rejection of dogmatic philosophy. The burden is on the reader.
    8. Modernists are perplexed, frightened, and fascinated by death.
    9. The threat of an apocalypse is fascinating to people because it is a communal experience.
    10. Nietzsche was acutely, and perhaps pathologically aware of his own self creation.
    11. Freud’s biographer said that Freud said that Nietzsche knew more about himself than any man who ever lived or was likely to live.
    12. Nietzsche loved fate. It’s a threat and an opportunity.

[Lecture Six: The Will to Power](http://rickroderick.org/206-nietzsche-the-will-to-power-1991/)

1. A myth about Nietzsche is that his work is related to Fascism
    1. This is because his texts have been used by socialist organizations
    2. Nietzsche viewed himself as a "good European" rather than a "good German".
    3. Nietzsche scorned German nationalism.
    4. Many interesting tex have risks.
    5. The return of Nietzsche in the 60’s and his re-return in the 80’s and 90’s, have been interpreted as anarchist and left-wing.
    6. Nietzsche’s text allows for multiple political uses.
2. "The Will to Power" is the name of a text was compiled by Nietzsche’s sister.
    1. Nietzsche’s view of power is not as simple as the domination of one person over another. This is because there is no essential self, only multiple personas that have the coherence of a character.
    2. Selves aren’t simple, and neither is power.
    3. Power is applied vertically. We internalize relations of power within ourselves (micrological power).
    4. A good conscience and fairness are structured by power.
    5. For Nietzsche, power is relational, a complex relational set of intervening and interacting effects.
3. Foucault’s "Discipline and Punish" shows us the politics of reading Nietzsche.
    1. Foucault does a genealogy of forms of punishment – how they changed from the feudal to the modern period.
    2. "The Spectacle of the Scaffold" details an execution and the conditions of possibility for those practices.
    3. A condition of reversal occurs when the victim becomes the local point and wins sympathy of the crowd.
    4. Bentham. the utilitarian, designed the "panoptical" which was more of a principle than a building.
        1. There was surveillance power – you can be seen, but you can’t see them.
        2. It is a new mode of discipline which signifies the expansion of power across many aspects of life.
    5. Another modern day reversal is occurring in the university. Knowledge seems free of power, but according to Nietzsche, where there is knowledge, there are the effects of power.

[Lecture Seven: Nietzsche as Artist](http://rickroderick.org/207-nietzsche-as-artist-1991/)

1. Nietzsche in comparison to other great thinkers
    1. Nietzsche has been praised as a forerunner of Psychoanalysis
    2. For Kierkegaard, the search for an authentic self is doomed to fail.
        1. He says that the self is a despairing relation.
        2. Nietzsche puts a positive twist on this view saying that the self is a "risky" relation to itself.
2. An uninterpretable text of Nietzsche’s is "Thus Spoke Zarathustra".
    1. This contains a parody of the Bible. There is a "sermon on the mount" given for cows.
    2. The text is meant to enact the gay science.
    3. It is self-indulgent and especially appealing to adolescents, as is much of Nietzsche’s work.
    4. You are meant to have a good time with the text and to be challenged by it to try to remember your adolescence.
    5. Mass media has eliminated the necessity for religion.
    6. Intoxication has always been an important aspect of culture.
    7. Nihilism is not a strong enough name for the threat faced by human subjectivity and lived experience in the terrain of our culture.
3. War is the last indication of reality, but now even that may not be true.
    1. The gulf war can be considered a virtual non-reality.
    2. Our culture has as excess of the visual.

[Lecture Eight: Nietzsche’s Progeny](http://rickroderick.org/208-nietzsches-progeny-1991/)

1. Nietzsche says there are no last interpretations of desperate moments, which makes in difficult to conclude.
    1. Nietzsche had no children, so why the term "progeny"?
    2. Nietzsche’s texts were written to fail. If they are successful no any way it is
2. The postmodern condition continued:
    1. The saturation of modes of information, surveillance, and control are at a level of such intensity that they qualitatively change the nature of our experience.
    2. In the 19th century, massive forms of production caused by manual labor to be replaced with mechanical labor.
    3. In the mid to late 20th century, there was a switch from technology that replaces manual labor with technology that replaces mental/intellectual labor and even human experience.
        1. We value sports because with the decrease in manual labor, it is a way to vicariously enjoy the pleasure of the body.
        2. Everything that was directly lived has now been reduced to an image or representation.
    4. "Nihilism technologically realized": people born into a culture where an apocalypse is technologically possible are different from Nietzsche’s time when nihilism was a matter of the drying up of subjectivity and belief formation. Nietzsche’s hope was to create new ones.
        1. Nietzsche did not realize that nihilism would become technologically possible.
        2. Apocalypse is a utopian ideal. We are much more likely to trod endlessly, solving technical adjustments.
    5. "Virtual reality suits" provide a prepackaged experience. Commodities are no longer just things of use – they’ve become part of what we are.
3. Russell described "The growth of unreason in the 19th century". If there is no intellectual difference between sanity and insanity, reason and unreason, truth and falsity – then the lunatic who believes he’s a poached egg should be condemned only because he’s in the minority.
4. A final thought: fight to feel and live **anything**.

SUGGESTED READING TO ACCOMPANY Nietzsche and the Postmodern Condition  
"The Portable Nietzsche." -The classic collection of  
Nietzsche’s works in English (includes the full text of "Twilight of the Idols", "The Antichrist", "Nietzsche Contra Wagner", and "Thus Spoke Zarathustra") edited by Walter Kaufmann. This is an excellent volume to begin your reading of Nietzsche.  
"On the Genealogy of Morals" -Nietzsche’s most systematic work develops a powerful criticism of moral discourse. The book offers one of Nietzsche’s few sustained philosophical arguments.  
"The Will To Power" – This edited collection of Nietzsche’s notes provides a criticism of philosophy in general and a fascinating account of power that has been extremely influential in current debates on politics and modernity.  
"The Use and Abuse of History" – This short work is an excellent polemic against "historicism" which continues to challenge us today as an anticipation of out "history-less" postmodern condition.

## 300 The Self Under Siege (1993)

[Lecture One: The Masters of Suspicion](http://rickroderick.org/301-paul-ricoeur-the-masters-of-suspicion-1993/)

1. Current professional philosophy is “deflationary” in that it gives no answers to our larger questions, in particular our questions concerning our selves, our projects, our questions concerning our own selves, our projects, our place in society and in the world.
2. We have lost a vast resource of cultural meaning upon which we could draw to construct meaning for our lives. Meaning, in this large sense, can no longer be drawn unproblematic from religion. We have information, but not knowledge.
3. We all strive to have a “theory” or narrative about our selves., we want to have a meaningful story about our lives that affirms our humanity. In short, we want them to **mean** something.
4. The complex systems under which we live (economic, technological, global) have put the self”under siege”, overloaded with information and images that offer no meaning for us. We have difficulty making any sense out of our lives.
5. Marx, Freud, and Nietzsche (the figures named the “masters of suspicion” by the French Philosopher Paul Ricoeur) developed powerful criticisms of out cultural mechanisms of meaning in particular religious meaning. Taken together, they raise the problem of “false consciousness”, the suspicion that our certainties and our beliefs are the products of hidden economic, psychological, and cultural motives.
6. The reflect and respond to the vast changes in out views of what it means to be human that come along with modernity and the economic and cultural system of capitalism. Marx exposes religion as a mask for vested economic interests, Freud shows its origins in infantile distress and fear, and Nietzsche raises the suspicion that it is a mechanism of power and deceit. After them, no simple faith is possible.
7. They are the common possessions of our culture and their critiques belong to us. We have no choice except to engage them either consciously or unconsciously. They are the gate through which any relevant modern view of the self must pass. Thus, they mark the beginning of these considerations of the self under siege.

[Lecture Two: Heidegger and the Rejection of Humanism](http://rickroderick.org/302-heidegger-and-the-rejection-of-humanism-1993/)

1. Heidegger developers a powerful account of meaning by recasting traditional talk of the self and the human into an analysis of “Dasein”, literally “being there”. He hopes to discard much of the baggage of the philosophical past in a kind of “deconstruction” that has, and continues to be, very influential with thinkers as diverse as Derrida, Macuse, and Sartre.
2. We should not let Heidegger’s infamous connect to fascism blind us to his real insights. It is sad, but true, that even very bad people may have important things to teach us.
3. Heidegger does not begin with a “method”. He begins by beginning. He offers a hermeneutic of Dasein, or the historical and cultural self. A hermeneutic is a narrative, a story , whose humans are always already interpreting beings and, from this, the analysis of Dasein can begin.
4. In “Being and Time”, Heidegger is guided by the distinction between Being and being. The only priority of human being or Dasein is that we are the beings that ask the question concerning the meaning of Being (what does it all mean?). He is no “humanist”, rather it is Being that draws his concern toward Dasein which he proceeds to analyze across the dimension of time.
5. Humans relate to the past by being “thrown” into a world. This means we are socialized and have a language and a view of the self already. Thus, it is impossible to begin without a structure of prejudices as built into our culture and our history.
6. Humans relate to the present as “being at home in or not being at home in”. This means that we try to find a satisfying place view of ourselves and out world.
7. Humans relate to the future as “being ahead or ourselves” or “on the way to”. This means that we formulate projects and make plans. The fundamental structure thus revealed is that humans are beings who care, who have concern. This can be seen in what they build and do even more than in what they say or think.
8. Anxiety before death is the fundamental human mood, since death is the end or our projects and our concern. For Heidegger, authentic existence must not “flee from” this insight into the unthinking mass of people (the “they”), but rather use this insight to give meaning and purpose to our projects. Such projects are “free for” and “free from” the stifling yoke of conformity to “the they” or what other people think.
9. Against Heidegger’s powerful account of being human it can certainly be argued that “authenticity” is too abstract as a means to measure our projects. One can be an authentic Nazi , for example, just as well as an authentic Christian. Heidegger gives us absolutely no grounds for choosing one over the other.
10. Authenticity will be important in our account of the self, as will care and concern with a project, but it will not be enough to save the self under siege as the case of Heidegger himself makes clear.

[Lecture Three: Sartre and the Roads to Freedom](http://rickroderick.org/303-sartre-and-the-roads-to-freedom-1993/)

1. Sartre is a paradigmatic 20th Century intellectual: philosopher, artist, critic and political activist. For an American audience, however, he is known first and foremost as an existentialist. His novel "Nausea" and his philosophical treatise "Being and Nothingness" are the best examples of this period in his development.
2. Sartre’s existentialism was based, in part, on a misreading of Heidegger as a humanist; but this misreading lead to his own interesting existential humanism. The first principle of his position is an absolute atheism. God does not make us, we make ourselves. Sartre’s way of expressing this is that our existence precedes our essence.
3. Without God, humans are "condemned" to be free. Sartre sees our refusal to recognize our radical freedom as "bad faith"; a condition in which we treat ourselves as determined objects rather than as free subjects.
4. Sartre’s existential ethic requires us to ask of our actions; would others act as we act? Our decision must be made in the light of our humanity, but also with full autonomy. Sartre recognizes that without God some limits to our freedom remain such as the brute objectivity of nature and the behavior of other people. These limits are seen as negative. In his play "No Exit", Sartre goes so far as to say that "Hell is other people".
5. Sartre comes to modify and, in part abandon his earlier existentialism in favor of his own development of Marxism. In a sense, he tries to fuse his earlier emphasis on the singular individual and his growing concern with the fused collectivity, the group seeking to change its condition. In "Search for a Method" , Sartre uses a discussion of Kierkegaard as a representative of the individual and Hegel as a representative of the collective to express his desire to bring the two interests together in a future philosophy of freedom that, for him, only a revolution can make possible.
6. Sartre experienced both fascism and the liberation of the 60’s; his philosophy always reflected a profound engagement with hiss own time. Perhaps he is not a great philosopher, hut he is exemplary in his attempt to become a human being in the 20th Century under the most difficult conditions.
7. Sartre’s account of "bad faith" and his basic honesty in the face of the human historical condition will serve to guide us in our account of the self and its predicament in the late 20th Century.

[Lecture Four: Marcuse and One-Dimensional Man](http://rickroderick.org/304-marcuse-and-one-dimensional-man-1993/)

1. Marcuse became a pop figure, the philosopher of the 60s. He expressed a key contradiction in modernity. Modernity is "enlightenment", the end of myth and dogma, the power of reason; but it is also the rise of technology, capitalism, specialization, instrumental reason and the return of myth and dogma. The enlightenment built an intellect powerful enough to surrendering dogmatically before the powers of technology. This is the "Dialectic of Enlightenment" as analyzed by Herxheimer and Adorno and popularized by Marcuse.
2. Instrumental rationality, information-based individual reason, leads to irrational outcomes. Individual monologic rationality is not rational in the totality of overall system. How did the force of the love of reason become itself unreasonable? The self cannot escape siege under the sway of instrumental reason alone, it drains the world of meaning and leads to the entwinement of myth and enlightenment. The film "Dr. Strangelove" is one long example of the contradictions outlined by Marcuse.
3. Instrumental reason is the product of a one-dimensional society that produces one-dimensional human beings. Marcuse criticizes our society along at least two dimensions. First, the inner dimension: anxiety, despair, nausea and a massive industry in drugs to deal with these pathologies. A society of addicts. Second, the outer social world: **alienation** (separation from the subject and the object and the self in Marx’s sense); **rationalization** (bureaucracy and technical action in Weber’s sense). These produce a one-dimensional culture or banality which reduces human suffering and human desire to trivia and image.
4. Such humans have by now become deeply skeptical and cynical about almost everything; in particular, the government and the culture industry. Beyond that, we are becoming skeptical about our history, our meaning, our purpose and the general fate of the species.
5. Marcuse’s method of criticism is called internal critique which measures a society against its own historically accumulated concepts and ideals in order to point out the gap between the actual social practices and the principles.
6. Marcuse also never lost faith in the human species to reconstruct itself, to begin anew. This hope of liberation transcended the field of economics and standard Marxism, as well as the achievements of the so-called free and democratic world of today. He also rested his hope in the possibility of that the self could be won against the odds. Today, unfortunately, this view will seem to many quaint.

[Lecture Five: Habermas and the Fragile Dignity of Humanity](http://rickroderick.org/305-habermas-and-the-fragile-dignity-of-humanity-1993/)

1. Habermas is perhaps the last important defender of a kind of rationalism that attempts to save the contributions of modernity, while recognizing its distortions and pathologies. He will attempt to disentangle enlightenment in myth in the name of human emancipation free from unnecessary constraints.
2. Habermas begins his project with a distinction between labor (as analyzed by Marx) and interaction. The first is based on production, the second on communication. The first is monological, the second dialogical. Freud serves as the model for the study of distorted forms of speech and action upon which a critical theory of society can take its start.
3. But to criticize distorted communication, a model of undistorted communication is required. Habermas seeks to develop an argument that the human species has a fundamental interest in undistorted communication that is built into the very structure of language.
4. Undistorted communication must meet four conditions; the symmetry condition (everyone has an equal chance to talk and listen); the sincerity condition (everyone discloses what they believe to be true); the normative condition (everyone attempts to say what is right morally).
5. Such communication would make a free society possible in which the only force a free person must recognize is "the unforced force of the better argument". This is not just an elitist notion, since "in a process of enlightenment there can only be participants".
6. Undistorted speech and action opens us up to the concept of communicative rationality that acts as a counter concept to merely instrumental rationality as criticized by Marcuse. For Habermas, we should seek a balance between instrumental and critical reason, between science and the ethical and the aesthetic dimensions that have been unbalanced by power and money, state and economy.
7. The fragile self is caught between these abstract systems of control in its struggle for autonomy and meaning. Habermas’ project for emancipation holds out the hope that a measure of the dignity of humanity can be rescued from the one-sided development of modernity through the power of solidarity and reason.
8. Haberma’s project is ongoing and includes activity in the public sphere where alone the promise of a reasoned consensus based on undistorted communication might be fulfilled.

[Lecture Six: Foucault and the Disappearance of the Human](http://rickroderick.org/306-foucault-and-the-disappearance-of-the-human-1993/)

1. Foucault is a strong anti-humanist who believes that "man" is a relatively recent construction of a particular historical paradigm. Such paradigms structure discourse and action, as well as institutions and belief systems. They are, at the same time, systems of knowledge that are always interconnected with systems of power. Anywhere you find knowledge, there too you find a regime of power.
2. Knowledge is comprised of discourses that function through rules of exclusion. These determine who may speak, about what, for how long, and in what setting or contexts.
3. Foucault’s "Discipline and Punish" shows how the paradigm of punishment and the law shift from one period to another. In the feudal period, we have "the body of the condemned" as a singular figure and "the spectacle of the scaffold" which expresses the criminal as a transgressor and our interest in him.
4. In the modern period, we move to a paradigm of generalized punishment; from the body of the condemned to the entire social body (public works, school and prison reform). The reformers in many areas institute a micro-physics of power over the "docile bodies: of the "trained" and "socialized".
5. Foucault’s method of writing his "histories" rests on the postulate that there are no bare "facts", just interpretations and these are themselves only made possible by the currently existing regime of power/knowledge. Particular to his method are the following:
    1. reversal, that the perspective of the standard history and reverse it
    2. marginality, takes the focus off what has traditionally been thought to be central and look at the excluded
    3. discontinuity, drop the idea of necessary progress and look for breaks and catastrophes
    4. materially, look at practices more than at ideologies and
    5. specificity, take single instances to illuminate larger points.
6. Foucault wants to reclaim a kind of radical critique in the interest of people rendered inhuman by what he sees as the very discourse of the "human".
7. Foucault can be read as a novelist, a historian, a radical critic of society, and many other things. Most importantly, he has changed our discourse from Marx and the "factory" to Foucault and the "prison". He has carried forward at least a part of the task of freeing a new kind of self from the barbarism of what is still called the past.

[Lecture Seven: Derrida and the Ends of Man](http://rickroderick.org/307-derrida-and-the-ends-of-man-1993/)

1. Richard Rorty may be viewed as an "Americanization" of Derrida: widely considered the postmodern thinkers (perhaps wrongly). Here we will use Rorty as a guide to Derrida.
2. Derrida’s emphasis is on fallibility, contingency, finitude; positions partially demonized as relativism, deconstruction, and vaguely connected to radical politics, multi-culturalism, and so on.
3. "Deconstruction" originates in Heidegger’s project of the deconstruction of metaphysics, an "uncovering" of the history of Being. Derrida notes, as he proceeds through a series of techniques of deconstruction as reading/misreadings of texts, that philosophers have always tried to fill in the blank in "Being is __________”. But they have failed due to the nature of language which is constituted by difference, materiality of marks and phonetic signs, marginality, materiality. Words do not stand for things, they stand in for them.
4. Meanings depend not only on presence but also on absence. Words can always misrefer; a possibility once is a necessity forever.
5. The upshot is that there are no final interpretations, no last books. Better and worse readings depend on context and purpose. Meaning is not fixed "humanly" (against "humanism"). Philosophy has always already thought the end of man in thinking the truth of man.
6. For Derrida, "man" is implicated in the "white mythology" that is philosophy and whose time is rapidly passing. This leaves the "self". the "I", as no more than a vanishing positionality in a text. And this is a long way from the kind of story that might provide us with meaning for our own lives.
7. Finally, when reading Derrida, remember, he may just be joking. If he is right, even in part, the same might be said for Plato.

[Lecture Eight: Fatal Strategies](http://rickroderick.org/308-baudrillard-fatal-strategies-1993/)

1. The task of creating a life with the "self under siege" to the degree I have argued may seem impossible. At the very least, it calls for what Baudrillard calls "fatal strategies". So I begin this lecture with the work of Baudrillard, perhaps the last philosopher?
2. Baudrillard builds on the work Guy Debord, the situationist author of "The Society of the Spectacle". Baudrillard traces the symptoms and tendencies of the trajectory of the postmodern; a set of concepts appropriate for a new world of technologies of images and communication developing in the late 20th Century.
3. The first of these is the Hyperreal. This is the image, the reproduction that is more real than real, reality is whatever can be mechanically and technologically reproduced. This is made possible by the shift from hard to soft technologies.
4. The second of these is Simulations. Reality is that which can be simulated, xeroxed, virtual reality, images, data flows, information at rapid speed.
5. The third of these is Utopia Realized as the End of Man and World, with all their references to the regulation and control and obvious political meanings. Baudrillard ironically argues that America is Utopia realized in “the shadow of the silent majorities” and with all the banality that belongs to all Utopias.
6. For Baudrillard, we are, or are becoming, fractal selves; split, reproducible, basic life-style changes as fads, the disappearance of experience and the desire for a vanishing reality.
7. Beyond Baudrillard, Afrocentrism appears as an answer to reconnecting ourselves with "reality". But this too is becoming commodified in rap and "black" films.
8. The Ecstasy of communication, the vertigo of information overload, the banality of a Transparent society; can any of these postmodern symptoms show us the way out of the 20th Century and toward a new construction of the human? Can we find meaning in the "world" that is already upon us? It is our task to try.
