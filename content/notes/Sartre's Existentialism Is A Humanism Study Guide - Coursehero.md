### At a Glance

Sartre delivered "Existentialism Is a Humanism" as a public lecture in October 1945, a time when the world was just beginning to undertake the monumental task of rebuilding after World War II (1939–45). In retrospect Sartre's desire is clear: to clarify his philosophical position as part of a larger desire to clarify how Europe could move forward politically and socially after the devastation of a war fought on home soil. Sartre's main goal at the time, however, was to defend existentialism—the philosophical belief system that he himself popularized—from what he felt were false and misleading characterizations. On the one hand, the Marxists with whom Sartre shared many left-wing political ideas criticized existentialism for being indulgent and "bourgeois" because existentialism posits that people can only know what they personally experience, within their own subjective frames of reference. On the other hand, popular views of existentialism cast the philosophy as bleak and pessimistic because readers took the characters in Sartre's plays and his novel, _Nausea_ (1938), at face value rather than seeing them as illustrations of what it is like to be trapped in the limited state of bad faith. Sartre uses "Existentialism Is a Humanism" to reiterate the main goals of existentialism as he defines it and to discuss some terms—such as _abandonment_, _anguish_, and _despair_—that were easily misunderstood by his contemporaries. Although Sartre came to regret publishing the essay and to repudiate some parts of it, his clear definitions of a difficult philosophical system make "Existentialism Is a Humanism" important for today's audience.

### About the Title

Written in shorthand by the author and scarcely edited after the fact, "Existentialism Is a Humanism" was originally a lecture Sartre delivered in Paris on October 29, 1945, at the invitation of Club Maintenant. For Sartre, existentialism suggests that the meaning of human existence is defined through experience rather than through religion or generalities. However, the title of the published essay captures the main purpose of the talk, to show that, rather than having an indulgent or pessimistic relationship with the world, existentialists take an optimistic view of human potential. Thus, the title subverts the popular view of existentialism as somehow antihumanist. Instead, existentialism is a humanism in its focus on the human experience as opposed to a relationship between humanity and the divine. Interestingly, for many years the translation of the title into English read "Existentialism and Humanism." This more abstract and general title overlooks the sense of controversy that is central to the essay, implying that Sartre is simply discussing two things, which may be connected in a number of ways.

# Main Ideas

## Existence Precedes Essence

This central concept is the starting point for existentialism, subverting the idea that human beings are born with an essential nature. Sartre focuses his discussion of "essence before existence" on God, who creates man in his image and gives him a set of moral guidelines to follow. If essence comes before existence, then human beings are not free; instead their lives, thoughts, and actions become predetermined by their essential nature. In the absence of God, however, individuals are free to invent their own values; they exist before they develop an essence. The idea that people are free, Sartre argues, is a disturbing one. It requires that people take responsibility for the course of their lives and that they act with courage rather than hiding behind conventional views or choosing not to act.

## Absolute Freedom

"Man is freedom," Sartre announces at one point in "Existentialism Is a Humanism." At another point in the essay he writes that man is "condemned" to freedom. These two statements capture the essence of how Sartre views this central concept. On the one hand, without God to set guidelines or create man in his image human beings must realize they have no choice but to invent themselves. Sartre views this as a disturbing realization; once "cast into the world, [man] is responsible for everything he does." This thought causes anguish—since how can one person ever be sure he or she has chosen correctly?

On the other hand, if the primary condition of man is his freedom, then human beings can create societies and civilizations that are more humane rather than thinking they are trapped by deterministic forces outside their control. Moreover, they are able to adjust their actions, much like a painter can alter some images on a canvas. They are not imprisoned by an essential notion of how they must behave. Humanity is free to create a humanistic society, one that privileges dignity. So while the idea of absolute freedom produces anguish, it is also a source of optimism. It means, among other things, that people do not need to accept society's view of morality. They are able instead to create their own moral choices.

## Conscious Choice

The notion of choice is something Sartre discusses throughout "Existentialism Is a Humanism." It is "impossible" _not_ to choose how to live; "if [a person] decides not to choose, that still constitutes a choice." In other words people make choices all the time that alter the course of their lives and impact the lives of those around them.

For the existentialist choice is a particularly important concept because human beings are absolutely free to act; there is no essential moral structure governing their lives. That is why the choice must be made consciously, in full awareness of the impact on others as well as in accordance with a person's own values. A choice made consciously cannot be a bad choice unless a person is, as Sartre recognizes at the end of the essay, a "bastard." In fact, Sartre believes that, if made consciously, not only will an individual's choice be for his or her own good, but each individual will choose actions that are for the good of society as a whole.

## Committed Action

Although one of Sartre's critics' main objections to existentialism is that following it will lead to inaction, action is perhaps the most important principle of the philosophy. "Reality exists only in action," Sartre writes. The human project of self-invention requires committed action; "by constantly seeking a goal outside himself in the form of liberation, or of some special achievement ... man will realize himself as truly human." However, a person does not need to commit to a single project. Just as the artist has not committed herself to a particular finished painting when she begins to create, so a person is unaware of how suitable the project will be once she undertakes it. It is the consistency of the commitment, and the willingness to act, that matter.

# Context

## World War II

In September 1939, German dictator Adolf Hitler's forces invaded Poland, sending shockwaves through western Europe. France and England responded immediately by declaring war against Germany, and until the defeat of Nazi forces in 1945, the continent of Europe was at the center of a war that left nearly 60 million soldiers and civilians dead worldwide. By June 1940 Paris had fallen to the Nazis. With French General Charles de Gaulle exiled to London, the country officially surrendered to the Germans on June 22, 1940, and hundreds of thousands of French citizens were forced into obligatory work service.

During the French Resistance, some French citizens felt betrayed by collaborators in the Vichy government, which was established by the Nazis in the wake of France's surrender. These resistance fighters worked to obtain intelligence documents and to disrupt communications and supplies. They were also instrumental in assisting the Allied Forces (the United Kingdom, France, China, the Soviet Union, and the United States) in the D-Day invasion in Normandy (June 6, 1944) where allied forces landed and began the liberation of Europe from Germany.

The impact of World War II on France was enormous. By the time the Allies invaded France in 1944, 400,000 buildings had been destroyed, and industrial and agricultural production were down to 40 percent of what they had been prior to the war. The disruption of the supply chain due to damage to the ports and railways meant that much of France experienced rationing until 1949. Much of the population was malnourished. Two thirds of the children suffered from rickets, a softening and weakening of the bones. The country was also demoralized by the experience of having watched collaborators with the Nazis carry out atrocities against French civilians.

Because [Sartre](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Existentialism-Is-a-Humanism/author/) delivered his lecture "Existentialism Is a Humanism" in October 1945, his words are not only an answer to critics of existentialism, but a rallying cry for principled action to rebuild a society devastated by war.

## The Rise of Marxism, Communism, and the Bourgeoisie

With the publication of _The Communist Manifesto_ (1848) Prussian philosopher Karl Marx and German philosopher Friedrich Engels launched what would be one of the largest economic and cultural movements of the modern era. The text opposed the treatment of workers during the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century, who were treated as mere cogs in a machine creating goods for the bourgeoisie, or upper middle class. Marx and Engels felt that once workers became aware of a communal class consciousness, they would unite and overthrow the oppressive forces of the landed class through a revolution. At that point a communist society—one in which the worker owned the means of production—would be established.

The Russian Revolution (1917) put Marx and Engels's theories to the test when the Bolsheviks, with their program of "peace, land, and bread" took power following the October Revolution (1917), unseating the provisional government put into place when Emperor of Russia Tsar Nicholas II was forced to abdicate the throne in February. The Bolshevik government, which enjoyed popular support from the people, handed over land to the former peasants, breaking up a centuries' old feudal system.

This rapid transformation of a society's power structure was intimidating to democratic societies such as that of the United States, where industry owners feared that their workers, who were organizing to demand better pay and working conditions, might next be caught up in the revolutionary fervor. Far from being an anarchic force, however, the communists were an inspiration to many throughout the industrialized world, particularly during the 1930s, when the decade-long economic slump known as the Great Depression (1929–39) caused widespread unrest and poverty throughout the United States and Europe.

First formed in 1920, the French Communist Party, disbanded at the onset of World War II, emerged as a powerful political force once the war was over. In 1945, the year Sartre delivered "Existentialism Is a Humanism," the Communist Party in France won roughly 25 percent of the vote and, for a brief time, played a role in mainstream French politics.

Addressing Marxist concerns in "Existentialism Is a Humanism," specifically the concern that existentialism would lead to quietism or the acceptance of things as they are, Sartre acknowledges the importance of Marxist ideology at a time when left-wing figures felt that a true economic and social transformation of society was possible. However, the Communist Party eventually lost popular support and became fractured by infighting. It was never to recapture the influence it had at the time of Sartre's lecture.

## Phenomenology and Existentialism

Phenomenology and existentialism are two of the most important philosophical movements of the 20th century. Thanks to Sartre's having discovered the writings of Edmund Husserl and [Martin Heidegger](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Existentialism-Is-a-Humanism/key-figure-analysis/#Martin_Heidegger) on a research trip to Germany as a young man, he is associated with both movements.

Phenomenology studies the structures of human experience, examining human reactions to external sensory stimuli as well as the individual's relationship to the concept of self and other. Some phenomenologists, such as Edmund Husserl, concerned themselves primarily with understanding the development of human consciousness, hoping to find a way to bridge the gap between people's perceptions of what they see and the external object itself. Others, such as Martin Heidegger, rejected a focus on the human consciousness and focused instead on attempting to understand the structure of a person's everyday existence in the world, something he called the Dasein.

Although the term _existentialist_ was first coined in the 20th century to describe the philosophical movement associated with Sartre and his companion, Simone de Beauvoir, existentialism began with French mathematician Blaise Pascal. Early existentialists, such as 19th-century theologian and philosopher [Søren Kierkegaard](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Existentialism-Is-a-Humanism/key-figure-analysis/#S%C3%B8ren_Kierkegaard), believed that life is absurd. Because people exist only later to die, it requires a "leap of faith" to find meaning, which, for Kierkegaard, involved an irrational commitment to God. Atheistic existentialists, such as Sartre, found meaning in other ways. All existentialists believe that existence precedes essence and that human beings must invent themselves—and in particular their values—rather than relying on a universal essence or human nature. For Sartre self-invention is not a kind of anarchy. Rather, he believed human beings have the responsibility to live consciously and engage with others in improving the world.

# Key Figure Analysis

## Émile Zola

Sartre uses Zola's naturalistic novels, which show how deterministic forces grind down the characters' lives, to explain how individuals are reassured when they can hold something outside themselves responsible. Although the plots are grim in Zola's novels, the reader understands that the unhappy fate of characters is inevitable, given the circumstances of their lives. In Sartre's own novel _Nausea_ the main character seems merely unpleasant and perverse because there is no ostensible reason for him to behave as he does, with no external force acting on him.

## René Descartes

In "Existentialism Is a Humanism," Sartre embraces the Cartesian cogito, "I think; therefore, I am," describing it as "the absolute truth of consciousness confronting itself" and argues that "outside of this Cartesian cogito, all objects are merely probable." He believes that this cogito is "the only theory that endows man with human dignity."

## Martin Heidegger

Sartre was strongly influenced by the writings of Heidegger and views the German philosopher as part of his existential tradition. Heidegger, for his own part, took issue with Sartre's inclusion of him in "Existentialism Is a Humanism." His "Letter on Humanism" (1946), a critique of Sartre's lecture, argues that Sartre's privileging of the Cartesian cogito ("I think; therefore, I am") means that Sartre has unwittingly embraced essence before existence—if a person can think, there is already an essential being.

## Immanuel Kant

Kant and Sartre approach ethics from diametrically opposed positions. While Kant believes in an absolute moral law, Sartre believes that each person must invent his or her own values and that there is no essential morality. Although he agrees with Kant's statement that "freedom wills itself and the freedom of others," ultimately he views Kant as grounded too much in notions of universality.

## Søren Kierkegaard

In "Existentialism Is a Humanism" Sartre discusses several concepts introduced by Kierkegaard in works such as _Purity of Heart Is to Will One Thing_, _Either/Or_, and _Fear and Trembling_. Foremost among these concepts is the idea of bad faith.

# Summary

## Summary

[Sartre](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Existentialism-Is-a-Humanism/author/) begins his essay by stating its purpose: "to defend existentialism against some charges that have been brought against it." Specifically, existentialism has been blamed for encouraging people to remain in a state of "quietism and despair" because it views all action as futile. The philosophical system has also been charged with focusing on the negative, presenting nothing uplifting about the human experience. Finally, Catholics criticize existentialists for "denying the reality and validity of the human enterprise" by ignoring God's commandments and his influence over determining human morality.

Sartre objects to such popularized views of existentialism, claiming that they have transformed a doctrine "strictly intended for specialists and philosophers" into the latest buzzword, which has become so "loosely applied to so many things that it has come to mean nothing at all." Although he acknowledges that understanding existentialism can be complicated by the fact that there are both Christian and atheistic existentialists, he says that the philosophy can be easily defined.

### Existence Precedes Essence

The main tenet of both Christian and atheistic existentialists is their belief that existence precedes essence. In order to explain this concept, Sartre uses the analogy of a paper knife. To create a knife the craftsperson must have a definite idea of its purpose and design; for instance, it has to have a blade that will cut and a handle that someone can hold. The maker has a concept of the knife's _essence_ before the knife _exists_.

Sartre explains that most major philosophers up to this point have viewed God as the ultimate craftsman and feel that he created man from a specific essence called human nature. "Thus," he writes, "the concept of man, in the mind of God, is comparable to the concept of the paper knife in the mind of the manufacturer." Not even 18th-century atheistic philosophers, who "suppressed" the idea of God, were able to do away with this notion that a definite idea of man's essence precedes human existence.

But if God does not exist, human beings exist before they can be defined; "man first exists: he materializes ..., encounters himself, and only afterward defines himself." It follows that there is no human nature because there is no supreme being to decide how human beings should behave or act. The first principle of existentialism is the idea that "man is nothing other than what he makes of himself."

According to Sartre, people project themselves into the future with a conscious awareness of doing so, and only when they act according to their concept of themselves (their essence) have they accepted responsibility for their lives. Responsibility is another important tenet of existentialism. It is not enough to think about what to do. People must follow through and accept responsibility for their lives. Moreover, in doing so, Sartre believes that each person is responsible for society as a whole. In other words, because each individual's decision affects the whole of society, people cannot help but make a conscious decision—one that, it is hoped, will lead to the betterment of society as a whole.

### Anguish and Abandonment

For Sartre these two terms have technical meanings that are different from the standard dictionary definitions. They describe the process by which a person comes to understand his unique position in a world without God.

_Anguish_ is what people feel when they realize the weight of responsibility they have for determining not only their own fate but that of society as a whole. Sartre explains that, while some people may shrug their shoulders and act as though their actions affect no one but themselves, they are simply lying to themselves and struggling with a bad conscience.

Sartre then evokes an example about which Danish philosopher and theologian [Søren Kierkegaard](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Existentialism-Is-a-Humanism/key-figure-analysis/#S%C3%B8ren_Kierkegaard) wrote extensively: the Biblical story of Abraham. In the Bible an angel appears and commands Abraham to sacrifice his son, Isaac. Abraham's anguish manifests as a profound doubt: If the angel is an angel, then he must sacrifice his son for God's sake. But what if the angel is not an angel? What if it is a hallucination or the manifestation of a pathological condition? Individuals feel the same anguish when they contemplate their responsibility to take action. "What proof is there that I am the proper person to impose my conception of man on humanity?" Existential anguish does not prevent people from acting but is "a condition of action itself."

_Abandonment_ is the feeling people have when they realize that God does not exist, and they "must bear the full consequences of that assertion." Unlike some secular moralists, Sartre does not believe that the concept of God can be "eliminated ... as painlessly as possible." Rather, existentialists "find it extremely disturbing that God no longer exists" and that there can no longer be any _a priori_ (knowledge without individual experience) good. It means, as the Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky famously said, "If God does not exist, everything is permissible." That is the starting point of existentialism, this state of radical freedom. The freedom is so absolute that Sartre says people are "condemned to be free." Abandonment stems from the sense of profound loneliness a person feels when faced with the choice of how to act in a world without guidance.

To further illustrate the concept of abandonment, Sartre uses the example of a former student who was forced to choose between avenging his brother's death by Germans in World War II and remaining home with his mother, who depends on him. He points out that no established moral order could help this student decide which was more important because neither choice was ostensibly wrong or without value. The student was forced to make his own choice, according to his own values; because he was free, he had to "invent" his course of action.

To live according to one's own values is to live an authentic life, but a person does so with a profound sense of abandonment, acting "without hope," because there are no outward signs pointing to the right action. Even if people feel they have received an external sign, they are the ones who attach significance to it; signs have no preconceived meaning and are significant only insofar as the individual interprets them to further his or her actions.

### The Project

In the absence of God, people must determine their own paths and act in accordance with their values. The conscientious decision to follow a single course is what Sartre defines as a _project_.

"Man is nothing more than his own project," he writes. "He is nothing more than the sum of his actions, nothing more than his life." Although each person may have within them the capacity to write a novel, find the cure for cancer, or perform a heroic deed, individuals do not exist except for their concrete actions in the world: "Dreams, expectations, and hopes only serve to define a man as a broken dream."

For Sartre a person who fails to act in accordance with his or her project is both a moral coward and living in bad faith. He cites the deterministic novels of [Émile Zola](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Existentialism-Is-a-Humanism/key-figure-analysis/#%C3%89mile_Zola), which pit individuals against the harsh forces of society and nature; heredity and environmental influences become the reason they fail to act. Sartre points out that many people become relieved when they have an excuse for failing because they have found a way to avoid responsibility. But for the existentialist there is no excuse, not even a temperamental one: "the coward is responsible for his own cowardice."

Because human beings have no essential nature—a person is not born a coward any more than he is born a hero—a cowardly person may at any time become heroic through his or her actions. The important thing is total commitment to one's project.

Understanding that circumstances are always changing, Sartre does not insist that the project remain fixed and static. "A certain project" does not define "man forever"; it can be "reinvented again and again." In this way society, which depends on the intersubjectivity of individuals engaged in similar projects, can evolve toward the greater good in a state of "perpetual construction."

### Moral Choice and the Human Condition

Because there is no God, there is no set of guidelines for human beings to follow, no essential concept of man, and, therefore, no human nature. Instead, human beings share a human condition, by which Sartre means the circumstances of each person's birth. These are _a priori_ conditions that limit and define each person's "situation in the universe."

However, Sartre makes clear that the divide between people in different cultures is not so great that their conscious actions would be incomprehensible: "There is universality in every project, inasmuch as any man is capable of understanding any human project." The "fundamental aim" of existentialism is to "reveal the link between the absolute character of the free commitment ... and the relativity of the cultural ensemble that may result from such a choice." A simpler way of putting this concept: Sartre acknowledges how each person is to some extent defined and limited by the circumstances of his or her life. At the same time individuals are absolutely free to act.

Sartre's way of reconciling the limitations on freedom that result from a particular culture or situation is to argue that people do not need to stick to a single project; no project "defines man forever." Instead, projects can be "reinvented again and again." Thus, Sartre concludes that "human universality exists, but it is not a given; it is in perpetual construction." He goes on to argue that, through their own conscious actions, humans "construct" universality by understanding the projects of other individuals, regardless of when or where they lived.

This part of the essay is admittedly difficult to understand. Sartre appears to be saying that existentialists have the capacity to change culture in slow increments by consistently committing to positive, humanistic activity, even if they have to alter the course of their activity due to circumstances beyond their control. At the same time the impulse toward living authentically and valuing human dignity can be recognized across all human experiences and situations in spite of cultural differences.

Sartre admits that commitment to a project is a "moral choice." Attempting to answer his critics, who accuse him of being arbitrary and anarchistic, he writes, "man finds himself in a complex social situation in which he himself is committed, and by his choices commits all mankind." All action affects others; even the refusal to choose is a choice. Thus, while the existentialist "must choose without reference to any preestablished values," he is not choosing whimsically but for the good of society as a whole.

By way of analogy Sartre likens this exercise of moral choice, which would appear to be happening in a vacuum—since there are no guidelines for individuals to follow—to that of an artist making a painting. "Moral choice," he writes, "is like constructing a work of art." Sartre points out that no one has ever blamed the artist "for not following the rules of painting established _a priori_"; "there are no aesthetic values _a priori_, but there are values that will subsequently be reflected in the coherence of the painting." Just as no one can judge a painting until it is finished, so should people hold off on judging human morality, which is continuously under construction.

### Bad Faith and the "Cult of Humanity"

Sartre concludes his essay with a more broadly impassioned ethical appeal, focusing on existentialism's capacity for individual and cultural transformation. First, however, he discusses the individual's obligation to act consciously or be judged as living in bad faith. Sartre writes that "any man who takes refuge behind his passions, any man who fabricates some deterministic theory is operating in bad faith." If a man _chooses_ bad faith, Sartre calls his decision "an error," adding that "we cannot avoid making a judgment of truth."

Bad faith is a lie, Sartre believes, because "it is a dissimulation of man's full freedom of commitment." Only "a strictly consistent attitude" constitutes good faith; everything else is either a fear of the responsibility associated with radical freedom or a grandiose illusion. The goal of existentialism is to lead an authentic life.

Finally, he addresses his conception of humanism, arguing that there are, in fact, two definitions. The first is the act of assigning "a value to man based on the admirable deeds of certain men." In other words, because of some human achievements, humanists conclude that humanity as a whole is "amazing." This way of thinking can lead to what Sartre calls a "cult of humanity," in which humanity itself becomes something that people are supposed to revere and worship, much in the same way that they had worshipped God. This type of humanism leads to insularity and provides people with another essentialism, or belief in innate validity.

The other type of humanism, which Sartre terms existential humanism, is a view of man as a transcendent being who is "always outside of himself." "In projecting and losing himself beyond himself," Sartre argues, "man is realized"; in "pursuing transcendent goals ... he is able to exist." In other words, because people are never finished with their human project, because they posit their conscious choice into a situation with unknown others who might affect the outcome of that choice and force it to develop in a new direction, they transcend themselves. This transcendence is existential humanism.

Existentialism is not concerned with discovering, beyond a shadow of a doubt, whether God exists. Even if he does exist, according to the text, "it would make no difference." The "real problem" is not whether God exists, but that man must "rediscover himself" and "comprehend that nothing can save him from himself, not even valid proof of the existence of God." Existentialism is optimistic, Sartre concludes, because it is "a doctrine of action."

## Analysis

### A Conscious Decision

In order to understand Sartre's definition of existentialism, it is necessary to realize the importance he places on several key terms. One of these is the word _conscious._ Sartre's use of this word is heavily influenced by his reading of phenomenologists Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger, whose work he encountered while doing postgraduate research in Germany. Phenomenology is the study of how human beings experience external reality from a first-person (presumably singular) perspective. How people react to sensory stimuli is one aspect of the discipline, but traditionally phenomenologists have also focused on human awareness of the self, objects, and others.

For Sartre self-awareness, or consciousness, has implications for both individuals and the world around them. To be aware is to accept responsibility, and to accept responsibility is to choose actions that benefit humankind. Awareness implies an understanding of how human beings are interconnected. An existentialist would not poison the ground water with toxic chemicals, even if it were permissible to do so, for instance, because environmental destruction is at odds with the survival of human beings and, therefore, the betterment of society.

The question becomes more difficult when an individual is faced with two choices that are ostensibly good, such as the example Sartre gives about a student who must choose whether to enter the army or remain at home with his mother. In a case such as this Sartre urges people to invent themselves—make a choice based on their values—rather than to seek counsel from others, who will give advice based on their experience or affiliations. "Whenever a man chooses his commitment ... in a sincere and lucid way," Sartre remarks, "it is impossible for him to prefer another."

Thus, Sartre places a lot of faith in people's ability to create not only meaningful lives but lives that benefit humanity—if only they accept responsibility for their actions. His optimism about human potential is what most clearly aligns him with other humanists, who, like Sartre, advocate for human dignity and social advancement.

### Bad Faith or the Authentic Life

The part of Sartre's argument most accessible to the common reader is his notion that society is, in many ways, false. People hide behind rationalizations and excuses; they blame others when the truth is they are simply not brave enough to stand by their convictions.

Although he does not discuss authenticity at great length in "Existentialism Is a Humanism," the quest to live an authentic life is paramount to his notion of existentialism. Authenticity is the state of living according to one's values and accepting responsibility for one's life.

Bad faith, on the other hand, is hiding behind society and adopting its guidelines, morals, and precepts without question. "If we define a man's situation as one of free choice," Sartre writes, "then any man who takes refuge behind his passions, any man who fabricates some deterministic theory, is operating in bad faith."

People might also be said to be in bad faith if they understand the nature of their responsibility but choose not to act. Sartre condemns inaction several times in "Existentialism Is a Humanism." He goes so far as to assert that people only exist in their actions, that "dreams, expectations, and hopes only serve to define a man as a broken dream, aborted hopes, and futile expectations."

### The Question of God

Near the conclusion of the essay Sartre writes "even if God were to exist, it would make no difference." This may seem like a puzzling assertion, given that Sartre is a committed atheist. But in fact it is the crux of the matter. For Sartre "God" has meaning beyond the spiritual. God represents the foundational belief systems that people adopt without question, repudiating their freedom and abdicating responsibility for their lives. Sartre goes on: "It is not that [existentialists] believe that God exists, but we think that the real problem is not one of his existence." The real problem is that man needs to "rediscover himself and to comprehend that nothing can save him from himself, not even valid proof of the existence of God."

Inevitably, Sartre sees God as a construct that stands between human beings and their potential. It is important to keep this in mind when reading the essay rather than becoming stuck in reaction to Sartre's atheism itself. Sartre equally condemns what he calls "the cult of humanity," or a self-congratulatory worship of humanism. Belief in any system of authority that draws its strength from positing an essential human nature leads individuals away from authenticity. For Sartre the problem is not God; the problem is hiding behind a system of belief instead of "constantly seeking a goal ... in the form of liberation, or some special achievement." In the final analysis people can believe in God and be an existentialist. But they must seek their own answers and truths.

### Limitations of Sartre's Argument

Sartre is effective when he defines existentialism as a discrete philosophy with its own terminology, and he does a fair job of refuting critics who argue that existentialism only encourages quietism by showing that the philosophy's central goal is to encourage conscious action. He is less effective when he attempts to address the Marxist critique that existentialism is merely contemplative and subjective. In order to refute this claim Sartre posits that a conscious choice can never be "evil" and that human beings, as a collective, will "always choose the good, and nothing can be good for any of us unless it is good for all."

This is a dubious assertion at best. In fact, common sense dictates that some things, such as great wealth, are very good for the individuals who possess it, and not so good for everyone else. Moreover, it is not impossible that someone who believes he is acting toward the common good is actually doing something reprehensible. Sartre's assumption that conscious action must be moral action puts him on shaky ground and is even paradoxical: if all human beings will act for the common good once they accept responsibility for their freedom, then it would seem that there is a universal human nature, something Sartre argues strongly against.

He encounters the same problem when he claims that "human universality" exists, even if it is "not a given" and "in perpetual construction." If there is human universality, how is there not a human nature?

In the final analysis Sartre cannot banish an _a priori_ nature, or essence, for human beings while at the same time insisting, as he does, that human beings from different circumstances and living in different parts of the world would consciously choose to improve society. His argument would be more consistent if he held that individuals are free to choose and may choose badly—i.e., against the welfare and dignity of others. As it is, his attempt to show how consciousness and responsibility bring people together in positive action reads more as an appeal to his Marxist critics than it does as a consistent analysis of existentialism. Indeed, Sartre was to move away from the existentialism of his early writings and become more firmly Marxist in works such as _Critique of a Dialectical Reason_ (1960). In "Existentialism Is a Humanism" he may have been struggling to find a way to reconcile the solitary nature of philosophic contemplation with what he viewed as the need for public intellectuals to engage in political activism.

# Quotes

1.

>  'Existentialism' is a doctrine that ... affirms that every truth and every action imply ... a human subjectivity. 

[Jean-Paul Sartre](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Existentialism-Is-a-Humanism/key-figures/#Jean-Paul_Sartre)

A main purpose of the essay "Existentialism Is a Humanism" is to redeem existentialism from the Marxists' charge that it is self-indulgent—that is, that it cannot lead to positive action. Sartre's whole position is that each person, acting in good faith, must behave in order to benefit the future of all people. Thus, "subjectivity" is not selfish or isolating; it is instead merely the starting point for the social order.

2.

> Each individual man is the realization of a certain concept within the divine intelligence. 

Sartre points out that most philosophy before the 20th century stems from the assumption that essence (the _a priori_ idea or concept of something) precedes existence. In other words God has an _idea_ of man before he creates him. Existentialists believe the opposite: man exists first and only then conceives of how to act. For the existentialist existence precedes essence.

3.

> There is no human nature since there is no God to conceive of it. 

Here Sartre summarizes the position of the atheistic existentialist. Man cannot have a common way of thinking or behaving because there is no foundational being (i.e., God) to decide what man is like. Even if all people decide independently that killing is wrong, that belief would stem from subjective human experience, not a collective morality. For the existentialist there is no such thing as a collective morality.

4.

> Man shall attain existence only when he is what he projects himself to be. 

An important part of Sartre's theory of existentialism is the concept of action. A person who only _thinks_ about taking action will not exist. Existence can only be measured by concrete action in the world.

5.

> Man is responsible ... not ... only for his own individuality ... but [also] for all men. 

This key point is another attempt to argue that, for the existentialist, the individual is not opposed to the collective. Sartre believes individuals who accept the terrible burden of freedom will inevitably take on responsibility for maintaining the social order and the betterment of human beings as a whole.

6.

> In choosing myself, I choose man. 

As an atheist Sartre believes that he has no need to act according to God's will or to fulfill God's plan for the human race. Instead, he is responsible for "fashioning a certain image of man" as he "chooses him to be." Choosing to value his own individuality, he has chosen to value the freedom of all people. Thus, choosing himself is, for Sartre, the same as choosing the entire community of human beings. He also believes that any person acting in good faith would choose actions that better humanity.

7.

> What proof is there that I am the proper person to impose my conception of man on humanity? 

In the absence of God human beings feel the anguish of not knowing whether their actions are correct. Despite this uncertainty, however, conscious action is all there is.

8.

> God does not exist, and ... we must bear the full consequences of that assertion. 

[Jean-Paul Sartre](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Existentialism-Is-a-Humanism/key-figures/#Jean-Paul_Sartre)

If God does not exist, there is no _a priori_ conception of human nature. People simply exist and must invent themselves, bearing in mind their relation to others. This tremendous responsibility is what Sartre alludes to when he talks about "full consequences."

9.

> Man is freedom. 

People think of themselves as bound on many levels—to their family, to their society, to their possessions even. Instead, Sartre believes human beings are radically free: a state that produces anguish and feelings of abandonment but can lead to the invention of a self and, ultimately, to a society more just and humanistic.

10.

> This is what 'abandonment' implies: it is we, ourselves, who decide who we are to be. 

As an atheist Sartre did not believe that God ever existed; the term _abandonment_ is metaphorical, describing an imagined loss. What Sartre means here is individuals must invent themselves because there is no essential nature to rely on.

11.

> Quietism is the attitude of people who say: 'Others can do what I cannot do.' 

The primary objective and motivation for writing "Existentialism Is a Humanism" is to "defend existentialism against some charges that have been brought against it." The charge that Sartre focuses on the most is the Marxist criticism that contemplative philosophy leads individuals away from action and diminishes their ability to join in solidarity.

Here, Sartre defines quietism, or the tendency to stand on the sidelines and avoid taking direct action, as a kind of bad faith. An existentialist _must_ act, invent him- or herself, engage with others. He or she cannot act in good faith and be quietistic.

12.

> Reality exists only in action. 

According to Sartre, man does not exist until he invents himself through action. To simply think about acting is not enough. Interestingly, Sartre returned to this view more forcefully later in life, looking back on his early life spent immersed in literature and dismissing it as a substitution for real life.

13.

> Although it is impossible to find ... a universal ... human nature, there is nonetheless a universal human _condition_. 

To say that people have a human nature is to assume that they have an essential way of behaving, thinking, and acting. This is the primary concept that Sartre and other existentialists reject, positing instead that existence precedes essence. However, people do share a universal human condition; every person is born into a discrete situation.

14.

> Human universality exists, but it is not a given; it is in perpetual construction. 


Sartre never explains why "human universality" is separate from "human nature." He does, however, take pains to demonstrate that people are continually acted upon by circumstances beyond their control, which limit their ability to do "whatever they like."

These circumstances of birth and situation create the need for flexibility in the construction of a project. For instance, if a renowned violinist loses an arm, he might alter his project from playing music to writing scores. Nevertheless, he is still actively engaged. A person might have to alter his or her project "again and again"; nevertheless the goals and commitment remain constant.  

15.

> Existentialism ... affirms that even if God were to exist, it would make no difference. 

For Sartre belief in a divine being means accepting that essence precedes existence. But God is only one way that people act in bad faith. Even humanism itself runs the risk of becoming a "cult of humanity," imposing guidelines for human action that encourage people to avoid taking conscious action. Even if God exists, man must still strive to live authentically, must still invent himself, must still commit to a project.

# Glossary

**abandonment:** _(n)_ the feeling produced when an individual realizes there is no God—i.e., no foundational being who has determined human nature and constructed laws to govern human behavior

**anguish:** _(n)_ the sense of uncertainty people experience when they have accepted responsibility and chosen a course of action but are unsure of how that course of action will affect others. Anguish results from not knowing the "right" course of action because, in the absence of God, there are no essential laws or guidance.

**a priori:** _(adj)_ relating to knowledge that is independent of experience

**atheistic existentialist:** _(phrase)_ someone who believes that man, not God, is in charge of his own destiny, which is both a tremendous responsibility and a source of anguish

**authenticity:** _(n)_ commitment to action based on one's own values. Anything else, Sartre believes, is living in bad faith.

**bad faith:** _(phrase)_ refusal to accept responsibility for one's life. People might endlessly talk about their project but never undertake it, or they might hide behind existing social structures instead of consciously living according to their own values.

**bourgeois:** _(n)_ a member of upper middle-class society. For Marxists _bourgeois_ means an enemy of the proletariat (working-class people) and the revolution.

**Christian existentialist:** _(phrase)_ an existentialist who believes in God but does not accept that God governs human behavior. Like all existentialists they feel that man must determine his own values and that existence precedes essence.

**despair:** _(n)_ the result of living an inauthentic life or living in bad faith. Sartre views despair as the state of being limited by probabilities outside a person's control, such as a lame leg or a train that arrives too late.

**intersubjectivity:** _(n)_ the interplay of the conscious action ("subjectivity") of all people. Sartre believes conscious action will lead all people to act for the greater good, each one acting alone but aware of others.

**Marxism:** _(n)_ a left-wing political movement based on the writings of Karl Marx. Marxists believe that workers are unfairly subjugated by the bourgeoisie and must unite to overthrow society and replace it with a more just distribution of wealth.

**phenomenology:** _(n)_ the philosophical study of how individual human beings react to objects, other people, and sensory stimuli. In Sartre's time it was a study of human subjectivity most interested in the question, "What is the self?"

**project:** _(n)_ a course of action committed to by an individual. Each human life is potentially a project, but only those who accept responsibility for determining their values and for acting consciously to uphold them can truly be said to have a project.

**subjectivity:** _(n)_ action and outlook according only to one's own values and perspective

# Biography

Jean-Paul Sartre was born in Paris, France, on June 21, 1905, the only child of Jean-Baptiste Sartre, an officer in the French Navy, and Anne-Marie Schweitzer, the first cousin of Nobel Prize laureate Albert Schweitzer. Sartre's father died on a tour of duty when the boy was only 15 months old. He and his mother returned to her family home in Meudon, where Sartre led a solitary and bookish childhood, substituting reading and writing for human companionship.

In 1924 Sartre completed an education that consisted mostly of private tutoring by entering the École Normale Supérieure at the University of Paris. While at the university, Sartre met Simone de Beauvoir, the renowned feminist, philosopher, and novelist. Although they were neither married nor monogamous, the couple maintained a close relationship throughout Sartre's life.

After receiving a doctorate in philosophy in 1929, Sartre completed his required military service in France and went on to work as a secondary school teacher in Le Havre, a port city in the northern French region of Normandy. The setting of his novel _Nausea_ (1938) is based on Le Havre. From 1933 to 1935 he traveled on a stipend from the Institute Français as a research student to Berlin and Freiburg, Germany. There, he discovered the works of German philosophers Martin Heidegger and Edmund Husserl and became interested in the branch of philosophy known as phenomenology: the study of human awareness. Their theories shape some of Sartre's most seminal works, including his major philosophical study, _Being and Nothingness_ (1943), and his collection of short stories, _The Wall_ (1939).

Sartre's career as a school teacher was interrupted by the escalation of World War II (1939–45). He was drafted in the French army, serving as a meteorologist briefly until he was captured by the Germans in 1940 and held nine months as a prisoner of war. He returned to Paris and joined the Resistance, a secret group of activists committed to ending the Nazi occupation of France. During this time he also wrote prolifically, completing not just _Being and Nothingness_ but also his first play, _The Flies_ (1943).

Following the war Sartre gave up teaching in order to devote himself to writing and activism. He is the author of several plays, novels, works of literary criticism, and philosophy. His best-known play, _No Exit_ (1947), touches on the suffocating banality of social conventions. Unable to take action, the characters remain trapped in a hell of their own making, a clear illustration of the "bad faith" Sartre discusses in "Existentialism Is a Humanism."

Later in life, with the publication of an autobiography, _The Words_ (1964), Sartre renounced literature as a bourgeois substitute for committed action. The same year Sartre was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, an honor he refused.

A man of few worldly possessions, Sartre remained a principled activist throughout his life. He was committed to taking a stand on the important issues of his time, something he felt was the duty of public intellectual figures such as himself. Although his health declined in the last years of his life, he continued to be active in protests, including the Paris demonstrations of 1968, which protested authoritarian political and economic structures. He died from a lung edema on April 15, 1980, and shares a tombstone with longtime companion Simone de Beauvoir in Paris's famous Montparnasse Cemetery.
