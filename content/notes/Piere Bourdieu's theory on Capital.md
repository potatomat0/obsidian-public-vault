# Pierre Bordieu's theory on Captial 
According to Pierre Bourdieu, cultural capital and social capital are two forms of capital that can be used to gain social status and power. Here are some key points about each type of capital:

## cultural capital  
Cultural capital refers to the cultural knowledge, skills, and practices that are valued by society and can be used to gain social status and power . It can take many forms, including knowledge of art, literature, music, and other cultural practices . Bourdieu sees this cultural capital as a ‘habitus’, an embodied socialized tendency or disposition to act, think, or feel in a particular way. 

there are three types of cultural capital: embodied, objectified, and institutionalized

- Embodied cultural capital refers to knowledge or skills that a person acquires from their habitus. Examples include accents, etiquette, and a robust vocabulary.
- Objectified cultural capital is the value inherent in objects of culture, such as works of art. Unlike embodied capital, objectified capital is more tangible 1.
 - Institutionalized cultural capital refers to the recognition of cultural competence through academic qualifications or other forms of institutional recognition.

## social capital 

Social capital refers to the resources that individuals can access through their social networks and connections. These resources can include information, support, and opportunities that can help individuals achieve their goals.

The distinction between these two types of capital lies in the source of the resources. Cultural capital is derived from an individual’s cultural knowledge and practices, while social capital is derived from an individual’s social connections. However, these two types of capital are related in that they can both be used to gain social status and power.
