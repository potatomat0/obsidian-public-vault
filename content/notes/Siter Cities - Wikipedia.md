A **sister city** or a **twin town** relationship is [a form of legal or social agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations "International relations") between two geographically and politically distinct localities for the purpose of promoting cultural and commercial ties.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_city#cite_note-Clarke-1)

While there are early examples of international links between municipalities akin to what are known as sister cities or twin towns today dating back to the 9th century,[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_city#cite_note-Origins-2) the modern concept was first established and adopted worldwide during [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_city#cite_note-:0-3)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_city#cite_note-:1-4)
