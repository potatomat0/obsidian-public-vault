# Addressing the problem

For the definition of postmodernism, visit: [[Postmodernism - plato stanford]] and [[Postmodernism key concepts]]

Irony has no redemptive quality in an of itself, it can point out problems and deconstruct things, but it offers no solution, it's like a rebel dethroning a tyrant, only to become a better tyrant 

Wallace's biggest concern was with the dominant cultural force of television which he believed had become too saturated with these postmodern characteristics. TVs response to dumb and overly sentimental sitcoms was ironing TV shows began criticizing themselves for being dumb TV shows

> It's hard to criticize a TV show that criticizes itself first. Shows become self-referencial and self-deprecating. In short they take nothing seriously.  

# Post-postmodern TV shows's response 

The later, more recent sitcom shows geared towards a more sentimental and earnest set of characters and humor, they do have cynical and ironic jokes, but each of them show their flaws and their redeeming qualities that make them human.

This makes a dramatic shift away from post-modernism shows no sign of slowing down. The best shows of our age aren't finding the humor in the gaps that have developed between people, they find the humor in the absurd and awkward attempts by people trying to bridge those gaps they want to show us that humans can have real connections and sincerity for each other. it's not impossible it's just really fucking hard.

Â postmodern thought with its deconstruction of every thing in its emphasis on individual interpretation leads us down a road of narcissism cynicism and detachment. To fix it we need not appeal to something as abstract or dangerous as the grand narratives of modernism to feel less lonely. Tt's perhaps this non-ideological pursuit of getting along of striving to have strong communal integrity valuing others for their human dignity unabashedly enjoying the things we find to be awesome.

As DFW puts it: 
> Since to be human is probably to be unavoidably sentimental and naive and goo-grone and generally pathetic
