[Recession: Definition, Causes, Examples and FAQs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/recession.asp#:~:text=The%20NBER%20defines%20a%20recession%20as%20a%20significant,income%2C%20employment%2C%20industrial%20production%2C%20and%20wholesale-retail%20sales.%201)

A recession is a significant, widespread, and prolonged downturn in economic activity. A common rule of thumb is that two consecutive quarters of negative [gross domestic product](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdp.asp) (GDP) growth mean recession, although more complex formulas are also used.  

Economists at the [National Bureau of Economic Research](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nber.asp) (NBER) measure recessions by looking at [nonfarm payrolls](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nonfarmpayroll.asp), [industrial production](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipi.asp), and [retail sales](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retail-sales.asp), among other indicators, going far beyond the simpler (although not as accurate) two quarters of negative GDP measure.1

However, the NBER also says there is “no fixed rule about what measures contribute information to the process or how they are weighted in our decisions.”

### KEY TAKEAWAYS

- A recession is a significant, pervasive, and persistent decline in economic activity.
- Economists measure a recession's length from the prior expansion's peak to the downturn's trough.
- Recessions may last as little as a few months, but the economy may not recover to its former peak for years.
- An inverted yield curve has predicted the last 10 recessions, although some predicted recessions never materialized.
- Unemployment often remains high well into an economic recovery, so the early stages of a rebound can feel like a continuing recession for many.
- Nations use fiscal and monetary policies to limit the risks of a recession.  
    

A downturn must be deep, pervasive, and lasting to qualify as a recession by the NBER's definition, but these calls come after the fact: It is not a clear formula to identify a recession as soon as one begins.

## What Causes Recessions?

Numerous economic theories attempt to explain why and how an economy goes into recession. These theories can be broadly categorized as economic, financial, psychological, or a combination of these factors.

Some economists focus on economic changes, including structural shifts in industries, as most important. For example, a sharp, sustained surge in oil prices can raise costs across the economy, leading to recession.  

Some theories say financial factors cause recessions. These theories focus on credit growth and the accumulation of financial risks during good economic times, the [contraction of credit and money supply](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contractionary-policy.asp) when recession starts, or both. [Monetarism](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarism.asp), which says recessions are caused by insufficient growth in money supply, is a good example of this type of theory.

## What Happens in a Recession?

Economic output, employment, and consumer spending drop in a recession. Interest rates are also likely to decline as the central bank (such as the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank) cuts rates to support the economy. The government's budget deficit widens as tax revenues decline, while spending on unemployment insurance and other social programs rises. 

## The Bottom Line

A recession is a significant, widespread, and prolonged downturn in economic activity. A common rule of thumb is that two consecutive quarters of negative [gross domestic product](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdp.asp) (GDP) growth mean recession, but many use more complex measures to decide if the economy is in recession.

Unemployment is one key feature of recessions. As demand for goods and services falls, companies need fewer workers and may lay off staff to cut costs. Laid off staff have to cut their own spending, which in turn hurts demand, which can lead to more layoffs.

Since the [Great Depression](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/great_depression.asp), governments around the world have adopted [fiscal](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fiscalpolicy.asp) and [monetary policies](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/monetarypolicy.asp) to prevent a run-of-the-mill recession from becoming worse.45 Some are automatic, such as [unemployment insurance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/unemployment-insurance.asp) to put money into the pockets of employees who lost their jobs. Other measures require specific action, such as cutting interest rates to stimulate investment.1

In recent years, recessions have become less frequent and don't last as long.

While there is no single, sure-fire predictor of recession, an [inverted yield curve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/invertedyieldcurve.asp) has come before [each of the 10 U.S. recessions](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/yield-curve.asp) since 1955, although not every period of the yield curve inverting was followed by recession.6
