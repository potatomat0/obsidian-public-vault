# albert camus key concepts 

## philosophy suicide 

is when people halt their thinking and questioning process to stick to a pre-made ideology (ie religions, absolute justice, entertainment and consumerism), or in another word, philosophy suicide is when you refuse to find your own values and meaning of life. or at least this is how i understand it lol 

the alternative to philosophy suicde, according to Camus, is **honesty**. it's when you confront uncertainty of life. which would then lead to **the absurd**

## absurdity 
to Camus, absurdity is [Ontologically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology)a category that is a fundamental dimension of our existence 

> absurdity are only expressions of the fundamentally absurd nature of life itself 

absurdity plays out in many different ways, but the principle dynamic lies in the tension between our natural yearning to know what is life's purpose, and the silent static non-responsive answer of the nature. it is this tension that makes both philosopical and literal suicide so compelling to man  

however, there is another way to honestly confront this absurdity without commiting suicide, Camus calls this type of person who can do this **the absurd man**

the absurd man is an existential hero, he is one who *lives without appeal*, who couragously realize the absurdity of life but at the same time reject the idea that it will lead him to a philosophical suicide, he lives with it happily, being open to existential questions and stay alive anyhow. this defiance of absurd condemnation is precisely what keeps suicide a valid option for the absurd man since suicide would be a way of going along with the absurd condemnation by implicitly affirming that life is so intolerably absurd that suicide of one form or another is our only option 

## there is more to the absurdity of life 

it's more like a nihlistic realization that our existence is insignificant, and we will all die and not be remembered, that the futile and repetitive daily rituals of our lives are non original and mind numbing. it's absurd not because of the futile and repetitive rituals themselves, since after all animals also has their meaningless rituals, human instead, experience the absurdity because of our conciousness of the sisyphean condemnation (or at least our potential to become concious of it if we can escape the philosophical traps) 

one must imagine Sysiphus happy. But not the typical happiness, in here, **Sysiphus's happiness is living his weight of days with a full and lucid cognizance of his absurd a lot together with a defiant, non-acceptance of it all of which propels him toward into becoming enchanted with his life, with "each mineral flake of that night filled mountain" as he put it. the very antithesis of the will to suicide literal of philosophical**
