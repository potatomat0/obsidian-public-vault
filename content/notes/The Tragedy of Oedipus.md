Oedipus the King is a tragedy by Sophocles, written around 429 BCE. The play is set in the ancient Greek city of Thebes, which is being ravaged by a plague. Oedipus, the king of Thebes, has been trying to find the source of the plague, and he has consulted the oracle at Delphi. The oracle has told Oedipus that the plague will not end until the murderer of Laius, the previous king of Thebes, is brought to justice.

Oedipus begins to investigate the murder, and he soon learns that he himself is the murderer. He had unknowingly killed Laius in a fit of rage, and he had then married Laius's widow, Jocasta, who is also his own mother.

When Oedipus learns the truth, he is horrified. He blinds himself and then exiles himself from Thebes. The play ends with Oedipus leaving Thebes, accompanied by his daughter, Antigone.
