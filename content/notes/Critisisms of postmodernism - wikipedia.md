[Criticism of postmodernism - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_postmodernism)
_____
**Criticism of postmodernism** is intellectually diverse, reflecting various critical attitudes toward [postmodernity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernity "Postmodernity"), [postmodern philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodern_philosophy "Postmodern philosophy"), [postmodern art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodern_art "Postmodern art"), and [postmodern architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodern_architecture "Postmodern architecture"). Postmodernism is generally defined by an attitude of [skepticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_skepticism "Philosophical skepticism"), [irony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony "Irony"), or rejection toward what it describes as the [grand narratives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-narrative "Meta-narrative") and [ideologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology "Ideology") associated with modernism, especially those associated with [Enlightenment rationality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Enlightenment "The Enlightenment") though postmodernism in the arts may have their own definitions. Thus, while common targets of postmodern criticism include [universalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universalism "Universalism") ideas of [objective reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective_reality "Objective reality"), [morality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_universalism "Moral universalism"), [truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth "Truth"), [human nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nature "Human nature"), [reason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason "Reason"), [science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science"), [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language "Language"), and [social progress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_progress "Social progress"), critics of postmodernism often defend such concepts. It is frequently alleged that postmodern scholars promote [obscurantism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscurantism "Obscurantism"), are hostile to [objective truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_(philosophy) "Objectivity (philosophy)"), and encourage [relativism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativism "Relativism") (in culture, morality, knowledge) to an extent that is epistemically and ethically crippling. Criticism of more artistic post-modern movement such as post-modern art or literature may include objections to a departure from beauty, lack of coherence or comprehensibility, deviating from clear structure and the consistent use of dark and negative themes.

## Vagueness

Postmodernism has received significant criticism for its lack of stable definition and meaning. The term marks a departure from [modernism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernism "Modernism"), and may refer to an epoch of human history (see [Postmodernity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernity "Postmodernity")), a set of movements, styles, and methods in [art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodern_art "Postmodern art") and [architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodern_architecture "Postmodern architecture"), or a broad range of scholarship, drawing influence from scholarly fields such as [critical theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_theory "Critical theory"), [post-structuralist philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-structuralism "Post-structuralism"), and [deconstructionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deconstruction "Deconstruction"). There is substantial dispute about which features of postmodernism, if any, are essential to the concept, and its enigmatic meaning and related "perceived lack of political commitment, subjectivist interpretations, fragmentary nature, and nihilistic tendencies" have led to substantial academic frustration and criticism.
The ineffability of postmodernism has been described as "a truism" and some claim it is a "buzzword".
This "semantic instability" has been long acknowledged in scholarship.

Critics of postmodernism frequently charge that postmodern art/authorship is vague, obscurantist, or meaningless. Some philosophers, such as [Jürgen Habermas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Habermas "Jürgen Habermas"), argue that postmodernism contradicts itself through self-reference, since its critique would be impossible without the concepts and methods that modern reason provides

Linguist [Noam Chomsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky "Noam Chomsky") has argued that postmodernism is meaningless because it adds nothing to analytical or empirical knowledge. He asks why postmodernist intellectuals won't respond like people in other fields when asked:

> Seriously, what are the principles of their theories, on what evidence are they based, what do they explain that wasn't already obvious, etc? These are fair requests for anyone to make. If they can't be met, then I'd suggest recourse to [Hume's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume "David Hume") advice in similar circumstances: to the flames

[Christopher Hitchens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Hitchens "Christopher Hitchens") in his book _Why Orwell Matters_ advocates for simple, clear, and direct expression of ideas and argues that postmodernists wear people down by boredom and semi-literate prose. Hitchens also criticized a postmodernist volume, "The Johns Hopkins Guide to Literary Theory and Criticism". "The French, as it happens, once evolved an expression for this sort of prose: la langue de bois, the wooden tongue, in which nothing useful or enlightening can be said, but in which various excuses for the arbitrary and the dishonest can be offered. (This book) is a pointer to the abysmal state of mind that prevails in so many of our universities."

In a similar vein, [Richard Dawkins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins "Richard Dawkins") writes in a favorable review of [Alan Sokal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Sokal "Alan Sokal") and [Jean Bricmont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Bricmont "Jean Bricmont")'s _[Intellectual Impostures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashionable_Nonsense "Fashionable Nonsense")_:

> Suppose you are an intellectual impostor with nothing to say, but with strong ambitions to succeed in academic life, collect a coterie of reverent disciples and have students around the world anoint your pages with respectful yellow highlighter. What kind of literary style would you cultivate? Not a lucid one, surely, for clarity would expose your lack of content.

Dawkins then uses the following quotation from [Félix Guattari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A9lix_Guattari "Félix Guattari") as an example of this "lack of content" and of clarity.

> We can clearly see that there is no bi-univocal correspondence between linear signifying links or archi-writing, depending on the author, and this multireferential, multi-dimensional machinic catalysis. The symmetry of scale, the transversality, the pathic non-discursive character of their expansion: all these dimensions remove us from the logic of the excluded middle and reinforce us in our dismissal of the ontological binarism we criticised previously.

### Of the term itself

It has been suggested that the term "postmodernism" is a mere [buzzword](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzzword "Buzzword") that means nothing. For example, [Dick Hebdige](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Hebdige "Dick Hebdige"), in _Hiding in the Light_, writes:

> When it becomes possible for a people to describe as 'postmodern' the décor of a room, the design of a building, the [diegesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diegesis "Diegesis") of a film, the construction of a record, or a ['scratch' video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_video "Scratch video"), a television commercial, or an arts documentary, or the 'intertextual' relations between them, the layout of a page in a fashion magazine or critical journal, an anti-teleological tendency within epistemology, the attack on the 'metaphysics of presence', a general attenuation of feeling, the collective chagrin and morbid projections of a post-War generation of baby boomers confronting disillusioned middle-age, the 'predicament' of reflexivity, a group of rhetorical tropes, a proliferation of surfaces, a new phase in [commodity fetishism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_fetishism "Commodity fetishism"), a fascination for images, codes and styles, a process of cultural, political or existential fragmentation and/or crisis, the 'de-centring' of the subject, an 'incredulity towards metanarratives', the replacement of unitary power axes by a plurality of [power/discourse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power/discourse "Power/discourse") formations, the 'implosion of meaning', the collapse of cultural hierarchies, the dread engendered by the threat of nuclear self-destruction, the decline of the university, the functioning and effects of the new miniaturised technologies, broad societal and economic shifts into a 'media', 'consumer' or 'multinational' phase, a sense (depending on who you read) of 'placelessness' or the abandonment of placelessness ('critical regionalism') or (even) a generalised substitution of spatial for temporal coordinates – when it becomes possible to describe all these things as 'Postmodern' (or more simply using a current abbreviation as 'post' or 'very post') then it's clear we are in the presence of a buzzword.

Postmodern-friendly intellectuals, such as British historian [Perry Anderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perry_Anderson "Perry Anderson") defend the existence of the varied meanings assigned to "postmodernism", arguing that they only contradict one another on the surface, and that a postmodernist analysis can offer insight into contemporary culture. Kaya Yilmaz defends the lack of clarity and consistency in the term's definition, maintaining that because postmodernism is itself "anti-essentialist and anti-foundationalist" it is fitting that the term cannot have any essential or fundamental meaning. Sokal has critiqued similar defenses of postmodernism by noting that replies like this only demonstrate the original point that postmodernist critics are making: that a clear and meaningful answer is always missing and wanting.

## Moral relativism

Christian authors [Josh McDowell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_McDowell "Josh McDowell") and Bob Hostetler provide the following definition of postmodernism: "A worldview characterized by the belief that truth doesn't exist in any objective sense but is created rather than discovered. ... [Truth is] created by the specific culture and exists only in that culture. Therefore, any system or statement that tries to communicate truth is a power play, an effort to dominate other cultures. Culturally conservative writers, such as [Charles Colson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Colson "Charles Colson"), are characterized as tending to look askance at the postmodernist era as ideologically agnostic and replete with moral relativism or situation ethics. Other critics have interpreted postmodern society to be synonymous with [moral relativism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_relativism "Moral relativism") and contributing to [deviant behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deviance_(sociology) "Deviance (sociology)").

Many philosophical movements reject both modernity and postmodernity as healthy states of being. Some of these are associated with cultural and religious [conservatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism "Conservatism") that views postmodernity as a rejection of basic spiritual or natural truths and in its emphasis on material and physical pleasure an explicit rejection of inner balance and spirituality. Many of these critiques attack specifically the tendency to the "abandonment of objective truth" as the crucial unacceptable feature of the postmodern condition and often aim to offer a meta-narrative that provides this truth.

## Marxian criticisms

[Alex Callinicos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Callinicos "Alex Callinicos") attacks notable postmodern thinkers such as [Baudrillard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baudrillard "Baudrillard") and [Lyotard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyotard "Lyotard"), arguing postmodernism "reflects the disappointed [revolutionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary "Revolutionary") generation of 1968, (particularly those of May 1968 in France) and the incorporation of many of its members into the professional and managerial 'new middle class'. It is best read as a symptom of political frustration and [social mobility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_mobility "Social mobility") rather than as a significant intellectual or cultural phenomenon in its own right."

Art historian [John Molyneux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Molyneux_(academic) "John Molyneux (academic)"), also of the [Socialist Workers' Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Workers%27_Party_(UK) "Socialist Workers' Party (UK)"), attacks postmodernists for "singing an old song long intoned by [bourgeois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourgeois "Bourgeois") historians of various persuasions"

[Fredric Jameson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredric_Jameson "Fredric Jameson"), American literary critic and Marxist political theorist, attacks postmodernism (or poststructuralism) for what he claims is "the cultural logic of late capitalism", for its refusal to critically engage with the metanarratives of capitalization and [globalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization "Globalization"). The refusal renders postmodernist philosophy complicit with the prevailing relations of domination and [exploitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_slavery "Wage slavery").

Daniel Morley and Hamid Alizadeh of [Marxist.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxist.com "Marxist.com") called postmodernism a "bourgeois philosophy, permeating large parts, if not the majority, of academia today. It embodies the utter dead-end and pessimism of bourgeois philosophy given the senile decay of capitalist society."

## Incompatibility with individual freedom

[Michael Rectenwald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Rectenwald "Michael Rectenwald") argues that postmodernism "is incompatible with liberty, first because it sees the individual as a mere product, as constructed by language, social factors, and so on. As such, postmodernism effectively denies self-determination and individual agency. Second, the cultural obsession with social identity that is current today derives from the social constructivism of postmodern philosophy. Such social constructivism further denies individual agency." Rectenwald further argues that postmodernism's belief that "everything is a power struggle, the lack of objective constraints, the lack of belief in 'truth,' or any criteria for the judgment of facts, opens us up to the arbitrary imposition of beliefs—to authoritarianism."

## _Art Bollocks

_Art Bollocks_ is an article written by Brian Ashbee which appeared in the magazine _[Art Review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Review "Art Review")_ in April 1999. Ashbee refers to the importance given to language in "post-modern" art The post-modern art forms mentioned by Ashbee are: "installation art, photography, conceptual art [and] video". The term [bollocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bollocks "Bollocks") in the title relates to nonsense.

An example can be found in _[Private Eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Eye "Private Eye")_ issue 1482, being an imaginary interview of [Tracey Emin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracey_Emin "Tracey Emin") by an unduly fawning [Alan Yentob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Yentob "Alan Yentob").

## Sokal affair

Main article: [Sokal affair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair "Sokal affair")

[Alan Sokal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Sokal "Alan Sokal"), a physics professor at [New York University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University "New York University"), formulated the Sokal affair, a hoax in which he wrote a deliberately nonsensical article in a style similar to postmodernist articles. The article was accepted for publication by the journal _[Social Text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Text "Social Text")_ despite the obvious lampooning of postmodernists' view of science. Sokal liberally used vague post-modernist concepts and lingo all the while criticising empirical approaches to knowledge. On the same day of the release he published another article in a different journal explaining the _Social Text_ article. This was turned into a book, _[Fashionable Nonsense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashionable_Nonsense "Fashionable Nonsense")_, which offered a critique of the practices of postmodern academia.
In the book he and [Jean Bricmont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Bricmont "Jean Bricmont") point out the misuse of scientific terms in the works of postmodern philosophers but they state that this does not invalidate the rest of the work of those philosophers to which they suspend judgement

## _Mumbo Jumbo_

[Francis Wheen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Wheen "Francis Wheen")'s book _How Mumbo-Jumbo Conquered the World_ broadly critiques a variety of non-critical paradigms with a significant critique of cultural relativism and the use of postmodern tropes to explain all modern geo-political phenomena. According to Wheen, postmodern scholars tend to critique unfair power structures in the west including issues of race, class, patriarchy, the effect of radical capitalism and political oppression. Where he finds fault in these tropes is when the theories go beyond evidence-based critical thinking and use vague terminology to support obscurantist theories. An example is Luce Irigaray's assertion, cited by Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont in their book _Fashionable Nonsense_,
that the equation "[E=mc2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalence "Mass–energy equivalence")" is a "sexed equation", because "it privileges the speed of light over other speeds that are vitally necessary to us". Relativism, according to Wheen becomes a sort of wall which shields non western cultures from the same sustained critiques. While inherent sexism in North America is open to hostile critique (as it should be according to Wheen), according to postmodern thought it is taboo to critique [honour killings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honour_killing "Honour killing") and [female genital mutilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_genital_mutilation "Female genital mutilation") in North Africa and the Middle East. Relativism will defend such taboos by claiming such cultures are out of the sphere of shared Western values and that we cannot judge other cultures by our own standards or it is defended through diminishing the severity of sexism by either denying its prominence (as Western propaganda/misunderstanding) or blaming it on menacing Western factors (imperialism, globalization, Western hegemony, resource exploitation and Western interference in general). Wheen admits that, while some of this may have merit, its case is highly exaggerated by relativism. Wheen reserves his strongest critique for those who defend even the most appalling systemic mistreatment of women, even in countries where Western contact and influence is minimal

## Counter-criticism

[Patrick West](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_West "Patrick West"), writing for _[Spiked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiked_(magazine) "Spiked (magazine)")_ magazine, argued that postmodernism's proponents "exhorted us to question orthodoxies. They preached scepticism, autonomy, anti-authoritarianism and liberation." West contrasted this with "Today's [woke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woke "Woke") warriors [who] preach obedience. When it comes to dissenters, they seek only to discipline and punish." West also disputed accusations of postmodernism being a Marxist ideology:

> Postmodern thinkers were broadly opposed to Marxism. Many may have been signed-up Communists in their youth (the French Communist Party dominated left-wing politics at the time), but by the 1960s they had become highly critical of Marxist politics. They rejected the idea that history was progressing 'dialectically' towards a communist future, or 'telos'. And they were often hostile to the scientific objectivity and 'Enlightenment' values so central to Marxism.

[Ephrat Livni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephrat_Livni "Ephrat Livni"), writing for [_Quartz_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz_(publication) "Quartz (publication)"), argued that postmodernists did not create the era of post-truth and fake news that we live in today, but "merely described it. The French academics of the 1970s ... saw the flaws in modernist thought—that old-timey Enlightenment-era notion that we all shared values, approved the same truths, and agreed on the facts. Instead, they acknowledged that reality is complicated. They recognized the changes happening in the late 20th century century—the erosion of authority, the ascendance of individual perspective—and developed the vocabulary to describe it." Livni adds that while there are still facts about occurrences that "make up reality.", what these facts mean "is up for dispute. There is no objective, universal truth we all agree upon when it comes to interpretation." Livini concludes by saying:

> Instead of blaming postmodernists for the messiness of our time, we should be trying to find a new kind of language—one that allows us to speak across divides, rather than rejecting opposing perspectives as inherently false. We have to learn to acknowledge the validity of a multiplicity of views and from this craft some kind of working truth. That may too be an illusion, but it will be more functional than living in denial. Otherwise, all that we’re left with is this impossible mess, and our perpetual rejection of life’s many inconvenient complexities.
