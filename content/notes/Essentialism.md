## Definition 

Essentialism is the view that objects have a set of attributes that are necessary to their identity. In other words, essentialism holds that there are certain properties that are essential to being a certain kind of thing, and without those properties, the thing would not be what it is.

Essentialism has its roots in ancient Greek philosophy, and was particularly developed by Plato and Aristotle. Plato believed that there are two worlds: the world of appearances, which is constantly changing, and the world of Forms, which is eternal and unchanging. The Forms are the true essences of things, and the things in the world of appearances are merely shadows of the Forms.

Aristotle also believed in essences, but he had a different view of them. He thought that essences were not separate from things, but were rather the defining properties of things. For example, the essence of a human being is rationality. This means that all human beings are rational, and that if a being is not rational, it is not a human being.

### plato and aristotle views 

Plato believed that there are two worlds: the world of appearances, which is constantly changing, and the world of Forms, which is eternal and unchanging. The Forms are the true essences of things, and the things in the world of appearances are merely shadows of the Forms.

For example, the Form of Beauty is the true essence of beauty. This means that all beautiful things share in the Form of Beauty, even though they may not be beautiful in the same way. The Form of Beauty is eternal and unchanging, while the beautiful things in the world of appearances are constantly changing.

Aristotle also believed in essences, but he had a different view of them. He thought that essences were not separate from things, but were rather the defining properties of things. For example, the essence of a human being is rationality. This means that all human beings are rational, and that if a being is not rational, it is not a human being.

Aristotle also thought that essences could change over time. For example, he thought that the essence of a human being might have changed over time, as human beings have become more rational.

Here are some quotes from Plato and Aristotle on essentialism:

- Plato: "The things which we see around us are like shadows in a dream, but the true reality is the world of Forms."
- Aristotle: "The essence of a thing is that which it is said to be per se, and not per accidens."
- Aristotle: "The essence of a thing is the cause of its being."

Here are some examples of how Plato and Aristotle's views on essentialism have been applied:

- Plato's view of essentialism has been used to argue that there are certain universal truths that are independent of human experience. For example, Plato's view of the Form of Beauty has been used to argue that there is a universal standard of beauty that is independent of what individual people find beautiful.
- Aristotle's view of essentialism has been used to argue that there are certain natural kinds, or kinds of things that have essential properties. For example, Aristotle's view of the essence of a human being has been used to argue that there are certain essential properties that all human beings share, such as rationality.

## The rejection of essentialism 

Postmodernists reject the idea of essentialism. They argue that there is no such thing as a fixed essence of anything. They believe that things are constantly changing, and that their identity is fluid. For example, they might argue that there is no such thing as a "natural" gender, and that gender is a social construct that is constantly changing.

Some examples of how postmodernists reject essentialism include:

- The idea that there is no such thing as a "natural" race. Race is a social construct that has been used to justify the oppression of certain groups of people.
- The idea that there is no such thing as a "natural" gender. Gender is a social construct that has been used to oppress certain groups of people.
- The idea that there is no such thing as a "natural" sexuality. Sexuality is a social construct that has been used to oppress certain groups of people.

[[Michel Foucault]] rejected the idea of essentialism, arguing that there is no such thing as a fixed or unchanging human nature. He believed that our identities are constructed through discourse, or the ways in which we talk about ourselves and others. He argued that these discourses are not neutral, but are instead shaped by power relations.

For example, Foucault argued that the discourse of "madness" has been used to construct a category of people who are seen as being different or deviant. This discourse has been used to justify the oppression of people who are labeled as "mad," and it has also been used to control their behavior.

In his book _The Order of Things_, Foucault wrote:

> "The human being is neither the sovereign subject nor the object of knowledge; it is the effect of a complex strategic deployment of power-knowledge."

This quote highlights Foucault's view that our identities are not fixed, but are instead the product of power relations that are embedded in discourse.

Here are some other examples of how postmodernists reject essentialism:

- **Judith Butler** (born 1956) is a feminist philosopher who has written extensively on the topic of gender. She argues that gender is not a fixed or essential characteristic, but is instead a social construct that is constantly changing.
- **Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak** (born 1942) is an Indian-American literary theorist who has written extensively on the topic of colonialism and postcolonialism. She argues that there is no such thing as a "universal" experience of colonialism, and that each individual's experience is shaped by their own unique context.
