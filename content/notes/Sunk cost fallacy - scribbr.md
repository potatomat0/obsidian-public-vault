___
The sunk cost fallacy is a **mindset that can lead to irrational decisions**. It is based on the premise that committing to the current plan is justified because resources have already been committed. The fallacy can describe trivial things like continuing to watch a boring movie you’ve purchased, or more serious matters like refusing to pull out of a failing business investment. In common terms, the sunk cost fallacy is often called “throwing good money after bad”

## What is the sunk cost fallacy?

The sunk cost fallacy occurs when we feel that we have invested too much to quit. This psychological trap causes us to stick with a plan even if it no longer serves us and the costs clearly outweigh the benefits.

The sunk cost fallacy can be observed in major life decisions, such as continuing to study something that does not interest us simply because we already paid a high amount in tuition fees; but also in simple, [everyday](https://www.scribbr.com/commonly-confused-words/everyday-vs-every-day/) life decisions (such as watching a movie till the end even if it’s boring).

In economics, a **sunk cost** refers to money that has already been spent and cannot be recovered. More generally, sunk costs can be anything that you have invested and cannot get back: the time you have spent in a relationship or the effort you have made to pass your first year in college.

Here are some examples of how the sunk cost fallacy can manifest:

- Staying in a relationship even though you are unhappy because of all the years you’ve spent together
- Thinking that you can’t change your [dissertation topic](https://www.scribbr.com/research-process/dissertation-topic/) because you have invested so much time into it
- Remaining in a job that is not satisfying because of all the months of training you had to undergo
- Sticking to your major, even though you realize it’s not the career path you want to pursue, because you already took several classes
