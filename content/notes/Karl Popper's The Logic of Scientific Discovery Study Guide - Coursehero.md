Philosophy

### At a Glance

When it first appeared in German in 1934, Karl Popper's _Logic of Scientific Discovery_ challenged centuries worth of conventional wisdom concerning scientific knowledge. At the time, the philosophy of science was dominated by a concern with how scientific hypotheses are created, a concern Popper regarded as more psychological than philosophical. The real business of a philosopher in this area, Popper suggested, was to understand how hypotheses are evaluated and, in particular, how hypotheses are tested. Today, largely because of Popper's work, it is widely accepted that a scientific theory must be _falsifiable_—disprovable, in principle, by some experiment of observation.

In the course of setting out his _falsifiability_ criterion, Popper also developed (and, in the 1959 English edition, greatly elaborated upon) an axiomatic theory of probability—one that did not depend on any single interpretation of what probability _is_. Questions about probability and its relationship to knowledge had assumed a new centrality in the philosophy of science with the rise of quantum physics, of which many hypotheses are framed in probabilistic terms. Thus, _The Logic of Scientific Discovery_ addresses the topical concerns of its day while laying the groundwork for a novel view of scientific knowledge.

### About the Title

In _The Logic of Scientific Discovery_ Karl Popper explores the philosophical basis by which scientific theories are tested and corroborated. Using tools from logic and probability, he seeks to explain the sense in which such theories have meaning and their relationship to the world they describe.

# Main Ideas

## The Falsifiability Criterion

Perhaps the most fundamental idea in _The Logic of Scientific Discovery_ is that scientific statements must be _falsifiable_. This idea means that a scientific statement must be disprovable, at least in principle, by an observation or experiment. The statement "Gabi aced her exam because the horoscope for Tauruses is favorable today" is non-falsifiable: there is no concrete observation that could conclusively prove that something other than Gabi's horoscope is responsible for her exam score. Saying that she studied for the test or attended every class or that the test was easy would only contribute to an explanation for her success. Such statements would not rule out the astrological explanation. However, the statement "All planets move in circular orbits" is falsifiable: as soon as one planet is observed moving in an orbit that is not a circle, the statement is proven false.

In arguing for falsifiability as the defining feature of scientific hypotheses and theories, Popper is working against a long tradition of thinkers who place emphasis instead on the _verifiability_ of statements. Both schools of thought agree that _testability_ of some kind is important, but they differ in terms of the results that can be expected from such tests. The viewpoint opposite to Popper's, called _positivism_, holds that a test can either confirm or refute a theory—that is, experiments and observations can establish a theory as true or false. Popper argues that scientific knowledge is not "symmetrical" in this way. From his point of view, many hypotheses are easy to refute by experiment, but all hypotheses are equally impossible to prove. It makes no sense to demand that scientific statements reach a standard that, to Popper, no statement about the natural world can possibly reach.

Consider the hypothesis, "All swans are white." From the positivist point of view, every time a white swan is observed, this observation provides partial evidence in support of the white-swan hypothesis. Positivists would not say that even a very large number of white-swan observations _prove_ the hypothesis, but they might say that the hypothesis is more _likely_ _to be true_ or more _probable_ as the number of such observations rises. Popper, whose point of view is now known as _falsificationism_, denies this. He suggests that although it is a good practical rule to prefer theories that have been thoroughly tested and _not_ falsified, it is impossible even in principle for a theory to be _verified_. The observation of a single black swan would falsify the white-swan hypothesis—on this point, Popper agrees with the positivists—but no number of white swan sightings could ever, from Popper's perspective, make such a hypothesis more probable, let alone prove it. Importantly, Popper does not argue that non-falsifiable statements are meaningless. Thus, even though his view has come to be called falsificationism, it is not really the opposite of _verificationism_ (which holds that a statement must be verifiable or falsifiable to _have meaning_). Rather, he argues that non-falsifiable statements are unscientific, even though many such statements may be both meaningful and important. The falsifiability criterion, as used in _The Logic of Scientific Discovery_, is meant to demarcate the scientific from the nonscientific, not the meaningful from the meaningless or the useful from the useless.

## Corroboration, Not Confirmation

If scientific theories can never be proven, what is the point of scientific research? This question naturally arises once Popper's falsifiability criterion is accepted, and Popper devotes considerable space to addressing it in his book. He argues that, although the results of an experiment can never prove a theory or even establish it as more probable, experimentation still plays a vital role in scientific progress. Specifically, Popper contends that experiments can help to _corroborate_ a theory even if they can never _confirm_ it. (In early works, Popper sometimes used these two verbs interchangeably, but in the 1959 edition of _The Logic of Scientific Discovery_ they are given distinct meanings.)

An experiment would confirm a theory if it were possible to say, "Based on the results of this experiment, the theory is true," or even, "This theory is more likely to be true." Popper rejects this possibility for reasons given above, that no amount of evidence for a theory can verify it definitively. Instead, he says that the best an experiment or observation can do is to corroborate a theory: "The results of this experiment are compatible with the theory, i.e., they do not falsify it." The distinction here is akin to the difference between additive and subtractive sculpture. In the traditional view, experimentation "builds up" positive support for a particular scientific theory, much like an artist might build up a sculpture from clay. In Popper's view, the proper—and indeed the only—way for science to proceed is to "chip away" false theories through rigorous testing. The resulting "sculpture," the edifice of accepted scientific thought, consists of the theories that have so far survived this process of chipping away. Science, for Popper, is more like a marble sculpture than a clay pot built up coil by coil.

The distinction between corroboration and confirmation is subtle but important. For one thing, the impossibility of proving a scientific theory suggests that the scientist's job is to disprove false theories by devising the severest possible tests. Devising experiments to defend or confirm theories is, in Popper's view, a waste of time as enumerating the observations that are consistent with a given theory cannot fundamentally increase human knowledge. Instead, scientific knowledge is gained only when a theory is shown to be false. Like much else in Popper's work, the emphasis on corroboration also shifts the focus from logic to methodology. Because theories cannot be confirmed, there is no special logical category of theory that can be said to be true and whose deductions can be accepted as facts. In choosing to accept the most severely tested theories, researchers are making a methodological _decision_, not a logical _deduction_.

## A Refutation of Inductivism

The falsification criterion rests on an even deeper foundation: the problem of _induction_—a type of reasoning in which generalized conclusions are made based on specific instances. Famously posed by the empiricists of the 18th century, this problem concerns how knowledge arises from individual experiences. Perhaps the most typical solution to the problem is to accept a _principle of induction_ as part of the basic rules of reasoning—as an axiom on the same foundational level as the rules of logic. Such a principle asserts that a general rule can be considered increasingly "probable," "justifiable," or "reasonable" as observations mount in its favor. If a principle of induction is accepted, it becomes easy to rationalize the "probability logic" that underscores it, for instance, the white-swan hypothesis that "all swans are white."

Popper, who places the problem of induction front and center in Chapter 1, rejects any such principle, along with the entire school of thought (_inductivism_) these principles belong to. He gives a few related reasons for his refusal. For one thing, as Popper observes in Appendix 10 of the 1959 edition, "all the repetitions [that people] experience are _approximate_ _repetitions_." Thus, it is possible to induce all sorts of hypotheses from the same data simply by changing the definition of what is "repeated." There is nothing to guarantee that a hypothesis formed in this way would have any of the explanatory or predictive power suggested by calling it "probable" or "justifiable." Another concern is articulated in Chapter 10, where Popper observes that the principle of induction is a rule that can never be verified empirically and would thus presumably have to be established through induction.

Importantly, Popper does not object to the commonsense use of inductive inferences. He is not saying it is foolish to proceed on the assumption that the sun will rise tomorrow. Nor, as he is careful to point out in Chapter 1, is he objecting to the use of "mathematical induction," a proof strategy that makes use of an established repetition in a mathematical sequence or structure. His objection is aimed, specifically, at the attempts to elevate induction into an ironclad rule of reasoning that can be used for any thinking, no matter how rigorous or abstract. "The sun will rise tomorrow" is a useful heuristic (argument, method, or procedure) for planning someone's day, and "Swans are white" may be a helpful approximation for bird-watching, but neither one rises to the level of a proven scientific fact.

# Context

## Logical Positivism

In terms of its overall theory of knowledge, _The Logic of Scientific Discovery_ can be described as a reaction to _logical positivism_, the view that scientific knowledge is the only form of factual knowledge_._ Although the figures associated with this early-20th-century movement were diverse in their thought, a few central tenets are recognizable, and it is against these that [Karl Popper](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Logic-of-Scientific-Discovery/author/) argued. For one thing, logical positivists embraced _scientism_: a strictly scientific world view that sees empirical science—that which is observable and testable—as the only means for apprehending truth and rejects religious and metaphysical claims. Further, it is the attitude that there is no meaningful distinction between scientific knowledge and other types of knowledge in that the methodology used in natural or physical sciences can be applied to other disciplines, such as philosophy and social sciences. Popper explicitly rejects this view and, as a cornerstone of _The Logic of Scientific Discovery_, proposes a criterion by which scientific knowledge can be set apart. For the positivists, statements that could not be expressed in scientific terms were apt to be regarded as meaningless. For this reason, in the early chapters of his book, Popper is careful to explain that he is not trying to say which statements have (or lack) meaning, but merely which ones should count as scientific. Moreover, bundled up in the positivists' rejection of nonscientific knowledge is a rejection of metaphysical claims, ones that, to the positivists, make no assertions about the empirically observable world. Popper is keen to explain that he views metaphysical statements as both meaningful and valuable, though he also sees value in distinguishing them from scientific theories.

The most prominent logical positivists actually agreed with Popper in some important respects. For one thing, as the term _scientism_ might suggest, they were generally highly interested in the philosophy of science—and, in particular, the epistemological (relating to the study of the limits of knowledge) basis of scientific thought. They further agreed with Popper that for a statement to count as scientific, it must be testable. The nature and outcome of such tests, however, represent a major fault line between the logical positivists and Popper. The former argued that a statement could be considered scientific—indeed, could be considered meaningful at all—only if it could be empirically verified. Popper rejected the very idea that a statement could be verified by empirical observations, no matter how numerous or consistent. He thus could not accept a theory of knowledge, or a theory of meaning, predicated on such verification.

Among the most famous precursors of logical positivism was the Austrian thinker Ernst Mach (1838–1916), best known outside philosophical circles as the physicist for whom the Mach number is named (a ratio of an object's velocity to the velocity of sound). A few years after Mach's death, a group of logical positivist thinkers (the broader, self-applied term _logical empiricists_ is sometimes used) coalesced at Vienna. Their de facto (in actuality but not formally recognized) leader was the German-born philosopher Rudolf Carnap (1891–1970), whom Popper treats as the figurehead of logical positivism in _The Logic of Scientific Discovery_. Despite the challenges posed by Popper and others, logical positivism remained an important force in academic philosophy well into the 1950s, enjoying its heyday in the United States during and after World War II (1939–45). Indeed, several of Popper's contemporaries—notably including Carnap—kept up a lively exchange with their famous critic through letters, articles, and books. Popper alludes to much of this material in the 1959 edition of _The Logic of Scientific Discovery_ and responds to some important critiques of his ideas in the appendices to that edition.

## Modern Physics

Popper published _The Logic of Scientific Discovery_ during an exciting but bewildering epoch in the history of physics. Just about 30 years earlier, in 1905, German American mathematician and physicist Albert Einstein (1879–1955) had published his landmark paper on _special relativity_, radically reshaping ideas of the connections between space and time, and between energy and matter. Eight years after that in 1913, the Bohr model, a model that described the structure of atoms, was first proposed by Danish physicist Niels Bohr (1885–1962). Related to these developments was the rise of _quantum theory_, which explained the transference of energy at the atomic and subatomic levels. A major research effort of the early-20th century was the relation of quantum theoretical insights to the observed, macroscopic behavior of matter as approximated by classical mechanics.

Partly because the results predicted by quantum theory were so counterintuitive, physicists disagreed as to how the theory should be interpreted. Niels Bohr, together with his colleague German physicist and philosopher Werner Heisenberg (1901–76) and various other collaborators, introduced what is now known as the "Copenhagen interpretation." According to the theory they introduced, certain classical ideas of position and velocity fail to hold at the subatomic level. Take, for instance, the commonsense view endorsed by classical mechanics that a macroscopic object (observable by the naked eye)—say, a chair—has a specific position in space at any given point in time. It may seem in principle that this position should be specifiable at any level of precision: "Earth," "New York State," "this city block," "the middle of this room," and so forth. Bohr and his colleagues asserted that this level of specificity was not possible at the level at which quantum phenomena played out. In their view a statement like "the electron of a hydrogen atom is 0.05 nanometers away from the nucleus" is not true—_cannot_ be true—in the same straightforward way as "this chair is 50 centimeters from the desk it faces." Heisenberg made the further assertion, now known as the "Heisenberg uncertainty principle," that the position and velocity of an object could not be measured simultaneously with exact precision.

Popper alludes to several results from modern physics, and from quantum theory in particular, throughout his book. His discussion of probability, for example, leads to a consideration and critique of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Popper questions the basis of this principle and its corollaries and proposes a series of thought experiments to suggest that atomic-scale phenomena may be more measurable than physicists have assumed. More generally, _The Logic of Scientific Discovery_ is addressed to the essential problems of scientific knowledge raised by modern physics. When the results of scientific experiments deviate so far from traditional notions of space, time, and causality, it becomes that much more important to stipulate what can be "known" on the basis of these experiments. It is a testament to Popper's work that physicists, including Einstein, read his book with great interest and worked with him to ensure that his characterization of their ideas was accurate. An example of such an exchange—in Einstein's own handwriting—is presented as the final appendix of the 1959 edition.

## Critiques and Refinements of Popper's Thought

Although hugely influential in the 20th century and beyond, the ideas presented in _The Logic of Scientific Discovery_ have also been subject to a good deal of criticism from other philosophers, scientists, and mathematicians. Many smaller-scale critiques were addressed in the 1959 English edition of the work, with Popper either revising his text where errors were pointed out or clarifying his position where he feels he has been misunderstood. Larger disagreements with Popper's theory of scientific knowledge can be grouped into two major categories: one line of criticism argues directly with Popper's assumptions, while another line holds that Popper has not accurately characterized science as it is actually practiced.

In the former group one influential and oft-repeated critique is that Popper's theory relies on an oversimplistic binary/opposition/polarity between corroboration and falsification—that is, either supporting or refuting hypotheses in observable experiments. The Hungarian mathematician Imre Lakatos (1922–74) argued that an observation does not necessarily falsify a theory simply by failing to corroborate it. Yet Popper's theory of scientific knowledge leaves no room for this possibility. Lakatos also proposed his own system, called the Methodology of Scientific Research Programs (MSRP), for delineating what he believed to be the distinguishing features of scientific thought. Among other departures from Popper's system, this methodology is a little more flexible in its understanding of how a theory responds to apparent falsification. A later critique in the same vein comes from American physicist Alan Sokal (b. 1955) and Belgian physicist Jean Bricmont (b. 1952), whose 1997 book, _Fashionable Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals' Abuse of Science_, suggests that falsifiability alone cannot reliably differentiate between a scientific and a nonscientific theory. They argue, for instance, that astrology is every bit as falsifiable—at least in terms of its concrete predictions—as is astronomy. Yet the latter is widely recognized as scientific, whereas the former is not.

Lakatos also objected to Popper's theory on the grounds that scientific progress did not actually follow the "logic" of falsifiability. This mismatch between theory and practice was another motivation for the creation of MSRP. Lakatos observed that theories were not discarded the moment a flaw was detected but were often held onto as the best available approximation. The various theories of celestial motion, for instance, had all been approximate—and were known to be approximate—in the eras they originated. The ancient Greek geocentric model of the cosmos was superseded by the astronomical model of Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus (1473–1543) even though the latter not only failed to explain some phenomena but even clashed with some individual observations of its day. This pattern was repeated with the theory of English physicist and mathematician Isaac Newton (1643–1727), whose law of gravity allowed for a significant refinement of the Copernican model even though it too left some questions unresolved and made some apparently erroneous predictions in individual cases. Lakatos held that a model of scientific knowledge that could not accommodate such partial advances was unrealistic.

# Summary

## Summary

### Prefaces

In the preface to the 1934 edition, [Karl Popper](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Logic-of-Scientific-Discovery/author/) points out a major difference between science and philosophy. Whereas scientists define and solve a problem within a preexisting structure, philosophers are faced with "a heap of ruins" and must determine what their problem _is_. In the preface to the 1959 edition, Popper takes issue with the notion that philosophical problems are really just problems with language or definitions. He believes "the problem of _scientific_ _knowledge_" is easier to analyze than the "problems of commonsense knowledge." Popper also asserts that the construction of "model languages" is too limiting and restrictive to adequately contribute to scientific progress.

### Part 1: Introduction to the Logic of Science

After two brief prefaces—one each for the original German edition and the first English edition—the book gets underway with Chapter 1 ("A Survey of Some Fundamental Problems"). The problems considered here are those faced by anyone who wants to rigorously characterize scientific knowledge: how it is acquired, what it consists of, and (most importantly for Popper) how it is tested. After critiquing various historical approaches to addressing these problems, Popper suggests a seemingly simple way of distinguishing scientific statements from other kinds. A statement can be considered scientific, he says, only if it is falsifiable—only if it can, in principle, be disproved by experience. In Chapter 2 ("On the Problem of a Theory of Scientific Method") Popper anticipates and addresses the objections of critics who seek a purely logical description of science, rather than a description that involves _methods_ of scientific thinking.

### Part 2: Some Structural Components of a Theory of Experience

The second part of Popper's book elaborates on the implications of his "falsifiability criterion." Chapter 3 ("Theories") dives into the logical structure and principles shared by all scientific theories. Chapter 4 ("Falsifiability") shows that as long as some methodological decisions are made up front, the falsifiability criterion can be consistently and meaningfully used within such a structure. In Chapter 5 ("The Problem of the Empirical Basis") Popper returns to one of the major problems sketched out in the first chapter. He argues that scientific statements can never be soundly inferred from sensory observations, and that observations themselves are "impregnated with theories" in a way that makes them less basic than they might seem.

Chapters 6 through 8 consider three properties that are necessary, or at least highly desirable, in a theory of scientific knowledge. Chapter 6 ("Degrees of Testability") proposes a way of comparing the "testability" of different scientific theories within the falsifiability framework. In turn, Chapter 7 ("Simplicity") shows how this framework accommodates the search for scientific theories that are as "simple" as possible. In Chapter 8 ("Probability") Popper describes how his theory of scientific knowledge can account for probabilistic hypotheses, a feature of special importance for modern physics. This chapter is based heavily on Popper's efforts to develop a system of probability axioms that does not rely on a single specific interpretation.

The last two chapters offer, respectively, a topical application of Popper's theories and some general remarks about the concept of corroboration. Chapter 9 ("Some Observations on Quantum Theory") discusses how the concept of falsifiability, along with the theory of probability presented in Chapter 8, can be applied to quantum physics. In Chapter 10 ("Corroboration, or How a Theory Stands Up to Tests") Popper turns his attention to the question of how a theory can be "corroborated" if (as he believes) it can never be positively verified. He also returns to, and further develops, the connections between his falsifiability theory and formal logic.

### Appendices

Two sets of appendices—one included with the German version and one added with the English version—constitute roughly the latter 40 percent of the book. In these, Popper elaborates on the arguments and theories from the main body of the text and responds in greater depth to criticisms of his work. Several of the appendices present, in formal mathematical notation, the axioms of Popper's probability theory, which in the main text is merely described in words. Others provide a more detailed critique of the principle of induction, which Popper rejects as a basis for scientific knowledge. The final appendix reproduces a letter from Albert Einstein that questions some of the examples used by Popper and proposes some significant clarifications.

# Preface to the First Edition, 1934 | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- In the 1934 (1st German edition) preface, Popper begins by pointing out a major difference between science and philosophy. Scientists operate within a preexisting structure of theories that allows them to define their problems readily. Philosophers face a "heap of ruins" and thus are charged with the preliminary task of determining what their problem _is_.
- Nonetheless, Popper suggests, some philosophers (himself included) "still ... believe that philosophy can pose genuine problems about things."

# Preface to the First English Edition, 1959 | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- The 1959 (1st English edition) preface begins with an elaboration of the points briefly made in the 1934 preface. Popper argues against the view, common in modern times, that all problems in philosophy are really problems of language or definitions.
- He contends that the "method" of philosophy is the same as that of the natural sciences: "Stating one's problem clearly and ... examining its various proposed solutions _critically_."
- Popper proposes to examine "the problem of _scientific knowledge_" rather than the "problems of common-sense knowledge." The former, he says, is easier to analyze and is central to understanding the latter.
- In the remainder of the preface, Popper critiques some approaches already taken to these problems, including the construction of "model languages" in which statements can be posed and analyzed. This approach, he says, is too restrictive and artificial to come to grips with actual scientific progress.

# Part 1, Chapter 1 : Introduction to the Logic of Science (A Survey of Some Fundamental Problems) | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- In Section 1 Popper questions the view that empirical science is categorized by its use of _induction_—reasoning from specific cases to general principles. He argues that it is an open question whether, and when, inductive inferences can be justified.
- Attempts to establish a "principle of induction," Popper suggests, have failed and are doomed to fail—as are attempts to reframe induction in terms of "reliability" or "probability."
- In Section 2 Popper charges past philosophers of science with engaging in _psychologism_, that is, with investigating psychological processes rather than philosophical principles. In his view, the question of _how_ people come up with theories—a major focus in earlier works on scientific knowledge—is essentially a psychological one.
- In Section 3 he reviews the basics of deductive testing: a theory is proposed, specific conclusions are deduced on its basis, and those conclusions are tested both logically (is the theory consistent?) and empirically (does the theory reflect the real world?).
- Such testing, Popper says, can lead to the theory being either _corroborated_ or _falsified_.
- Section 4 discusses another "fundamental problem," what Popper calls the _problem of demarcation_: How are scientific statements to be distinguished from other kinds of statements?
- Many past attempts to find a criterion of demarcation have assumed the validity of induction in different ways. For Popper, this line of thinking is unacceptable. Yet some criterion remains necessary before "scientific knowledge" can be talked about.
- In Section 5 Popper proposes three criteria that an empirical system must meet: it must represent "a non-contradictory ... possible world"; it must be clearly demarcated in some way; and it must represent "_our_ world of experience" as opposed to other possible worlds.
- In Section 6 Popper now sets forth his criterion of demarcation: a scientific statement must be _falsifiable_, that is, "capable of being _tested_ by experience." Whereas the inductivists argue that empirical statements must be both verifiable and falsifiable, Popper insists only on the latter.
- Moreover, Popper argues that definitive verification of a scientific hypothesis is in fact impossible. No matter how rigorously "proven" a natural law may seem, it remains possible that the counterexamples just haven't been observed yet.
- He then makes another point about method: falsification is useful as a criterion only if scientists remain committed to trying to falsify theories. It will always be possible, he says, to try to rescue or defend a weak theory by carving out exceptions to the general rule it represents. For science to work, this practice must be abandoned.
- Popper acknowledges in Section 7 that this assertion raises the question of when a basic statement (as opposed to a hypothesis or theory) can be called empirical, or observable. He calls this the "problem of the empirical basis." For now, he does little more than note his awareness of the problem, which he will return to in Chapter 5.
- In Section 8 Popper says, going forward, it will be important to have clear definitions of _objective_ and _subjective_. Recognizing that all perceptions are fundamentally subjective, he defines a scientific statement as "objective" if it is "intersubjectively testable." That is, a statement is objective if there is a way to reproduce the observations or experiments on which it is based so that many people experience similar "subjective" results.

# Part 1, Chapter 2 : Introduction to the Logic of Science (On the Problem of a Theory of Scientific Method) | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- In this chapter Popper returns to a point made in Chapter 1, Section 6. If the criterion of falsifiability will be useful, it requires that certain decisions must be made about which methods are and are not scientific.
- Why must such decisions be made? In Section 9 Popper argues that without some methodological rules, it is impossible to capture the purpose of scientific inquiry. It is unscientific to try and defend systems from criticism, but the logical concept of falsifiability does not in itself rule out such behavior.
- In calling for science to be characterized by both its logic and its methods, Popper is taking a stance opposite that of the positivists, for whom methodological problems are "meaningless" "pseudo-problems" (Section 10). Their view, he charges, is excessively "uncritical"—for example, in its assumption that experiences can unproblematically be translated into knowledge.
- Methodological rules, Popper points out in Section 11, are _conventions_, not immutable laws of nature. They are, in this case, "the rules of the game of science." In this spirit, he provides some basic examples of such rules: (1) the game of science does not end, though people may stop playing it; and (2) hypotheses, once tested, are not to be discarded "without good reason."
- The cardinal rule, he says, is that "the other rules of scientific procedure must ... not protect any statement in science against falsification."
- In aiming to show that his methodological rules have some precedent, Popper points out that many principles regarded as a part of scientific thought are "hypostatizations" (more concrete versions) of such rules.
___
# Part 2, Chapter 3 : Some Structural Components of a Theory of Experience (Theories) | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- Popper now sets out to define _theory_ in such a way that the applicability of his logical and methodological rules can be clearly seen. Theories, he says by way of introduction, are "nets cast to catch ... 'the world,'" not merely sets of symbolic statements.
- Backing up a little in Section 12, Popper defines the concept of a causal explanation and shows that such explanations depend on a combination of universal and singular statements. A universal statement here is something "of the character of natural laws," whereas a singular statement is specific to an individual situation.
- Next, Popper addresses and critiques the "principle of causality," which he describes as "the assertion that any event whatsoever _can_ be causally explained." Such a principle, he says, is "metaphysical" (thus not scientific) and not needed for the system he is proposing.
- In place of this principle, Popper suggests the methodological rule that "we are not to abandon the search for universal laws," for coherent theories, and for causal explanations.
- In Section 13 Popper makes a distinction between two kinds of universality. Theories and natural laws are _strictly universal_, whereas statements that merely describe a large set of individual cases are _numerically universal_. The former, which Popper also calls _all-statements_, are asserted as "true for any place and any time."
- Some philosophers, he concedes, do not accept this distinction, but in either case, the laws of nature cannot be verified in practice because of the vast number of possible events whose conformity to the laws would need to be tested.
- In Section 14 Popper then draws a related distinction between universal and individual _concepts_: "dictator" versus "Napoleon," for instance, or "planet" versus "the earth." Coordinates in space and time, he notes, are a kind of individual concept. Popper cautions that this distinction must be kept in mind to avoid confusion about the more general distinction between universal and singular statements.
- In Section 15 Popper then compares the aforementioned strictly universal statements with _existential_ statements. These two classes of statement are related by negation: the universal statement, "All ravens are black," is negated by the existential statement, "There exists at least one black raven."
- It follows that the universal statements themselves can be expressed as _nonexistence statements_: a hypothetical instance, not used by Popper but drawing from his previous examples, would be for instance, "There is no raven that is not black."
- This prohibitive or proscriptive character is the source of universal statements' falsifiability. To falsify the statement, "All ravens are black," it is sufficient to produce one example of a non-black raven. This example also explains the asymmetry between verifiability and falsifiability: it takes just one white raven to _disprove_ the "all black ravens" hypothesis, but no number of black ravens can _prove_ that same claim.
- In Section 16 Popper moves on to consider how theories fit together into a system. He describes the desirability of—and the traditional tendency to pursue—_axiomatized_ systems, those with a minimum number of necessary, noncontradictory assumptions at their core. These assumptions, called _axioms_, not only must fail to contradict one another, they must also be both necessary and sufficient to deduce the rest of the system. Setting forth theories in this way has the benefit of making it easier to scrutinize the relationships among parts of the system.
- Popper discusses in Section 17 that axioms can be viewed in two basic ways: as conventions or as empirical hypotheses. If axioms are treated as conventions, then they essentially define the different parts of the theory and restrict the values of the variables that can fit into those definitions.
- If instead axioms are treated as empirical hypotheses, Popper argues, difficulties arise because it is unclear how to proceed from the universality of the axioms to the specificity of individual objects or events.
- Within a theoretical system, statements can be ranked in terms of their universality, with axioms at the highest level (Section 18). Less universal statements are deduced from more universal ones, and the falsification of a less universal statement implies the falsification of the more universal ones from which it is deduced. The logical rule by which this falsification proceeds is the _modus tollens_.

# Part 2, Chapter 4 : Some Structural Components of a Theory of Experience (Falsifiability) | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- Popper next attempts to relate his criterion of falsifiability explained in Chapters 1 and 2 to the notion of a theoretical system developed in Chapter 3. Before doing so, he makes the temporary assumption that some basic (singular) statements can indeed be falsified.
- In Section 19 Popper introduces and critiques a viewpoint he calls _conventionalism_, according to which the so-called laws of nature are the "free," artificial creations of humankind. It follows, from this perspective, that the laws of nature cannot be falsified through observation or experiment, since all such attempts at falsification will take place within this same artificial framework.
- This system of thought, Popper says, is "self-contained," "defensible," and unlikely to prove inconsistent—yet he finds it "unacceptable" because of its inherent tendency to defend the status quo and explain away apparent conflicts between theory and observation.
- Those who "hope to make new discoveries," he reflects, will not be well served by conventionalism. They must instead be prepared to reexamine even the most seemingly secure theories in the light of new experimental evidence.
- Empirical and conventionalist systems of statements, Popper continues in Section 20, cannot be distinguished by virtue of their form. "_Only with reference to the methods applied_" can empiricism and conventionalism be told apart. In other words, empirical science stands apart because it involves a _decision_ not to try and "save" theories by, say, tacking on auxiliary hypotheses to address each new objection.
- One consequence of this methodological decision is that auxiliary hypotheses may be added only if they make the system more, not less, testable—and thus more falsifiable.
- Another consequence is that when a system is changed (for example, by adding new hypotheses or changing definitions), the whole system must be "reexamined as if it were new."
- Once "conventionalist stratagems" are banned, Popper suggests in Section 21, it becomes possible to ask what makes a system falsifiable in logical terms. After considering and rejecting a few superficially plausible explanations, he concludes that a theory is falsifiable (i.e., empirical) if it clearly divides all possible basic statements into two "non-empty" classes: those it rules out, and those it permits. That is, "a theory is falsifiable if the class of its potential falsifiers is not empty."
- Falsifiability, he clarifies in Section 22, is not the same as falsification: a theory may be shown to be falsifiable even if no falsifying statement has been shown to be true. Moreover, "a few stray basic statements" are insufficient to falsify a theory: there must be a "_reproducible effect_ which refutes the theory." The falsifying hypothesis must, in turn, itself be falsifiable.
- In Section 23 Popper discusses the ideas of falsification and basic statements in somewhat less formal language. A basic statement, he says, is one that "describes an _occurrence_" (for example, "it is now thundering here"). Multiple logically equivalent statements may correspond to the same occurrence.
- An _event_, as distinct from an occurrence, has something universal about it: "It is thundering [in some place, at some time]."
- Thus, a basic statement "asserts the occurrence of [an] event" at some particular point in time and space.
- Falsifiable theories are then distinguished by the fact that they rule out not just occurrences, but entire events. If "all possible worlds of experience" are regarded as a circle, and each event as a sector of that circle, then a falsifiable theory is one that rules out at least one entire sector.
- All theoretical systems, and indeed all systems of axioms, must be consistent, meaning that they do not contradict themselves (Section 24). This is not just because self-contradictory systems are "false." An approximation of a natural law may be useful despite being "false" in some sense. Rather, the danger posed by inconsistent systems comes from the fact that _any_ statement can be logically derived from such a system, rendering the system itself not only "false" but utterly useless. This requirement precedes falsifiability, which is in a sense a higher bar that empirical systems specifically must clear.

# Part 2, Chapter 5 : Some Structural Components of a Theory of Experience (The Problem of the Empirical Basis) | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- In preceding chapters Popper has shown how the falsifiability of theories relates to the falsifiability of the _basic statements_ that corroborate or refute those theories. He now sets out to explain in more detail what these statements are and how they can be falsified.
- In Section 25, although Popper concedes that the empirical sciences are in some way based on sense perceptions, he rejects the idea that they are _reducible_ to such perceptions. This, he admits, is a nontrivial issue: if the statements of science are to be justified by other statements, an infinite regress seems inevitable. Admitting perceptual experiences as a justification for statements, meanwhile, amounts to psychologism, which Popper likewise finds unacceptable.
- The psychologistic view, Popper contends, ends up relying on induction (critiqued in Chapter 1) as a tool for generalizing from these individual experiences.
- In Section 26 Popper next considers a specific modern theory that he sees as an expression of psychologism. According to this theory, "the logic of science ... does not speak of (physical) 'objects', but of words" and "not of facts, but of sentences." So far, so good, Popper says, but this theory fails to explain why some basic statements should be accepted as a basis for scientific inquiry. It thus restates, but does not solve, the problem of the empirical basis.
- What is the method by which some basic statements (or _protocol sentences_) are accepted and others rejected? In Popper's view, this problem has thwarted many otherwise highly sophisticated attempts to describe the logic of scientific reasoning.
- The empirical basis of science, Popper asserts in Section 27, cannot be in any way psychological—it cannot involve the investigator's feelings of doubt and conviction. In particular, a sense of disbelief, no matter how strong, is not adequate grounds for rejecting a theory.
- In Section 28 comes the characterization of basic statements. Such statements, Popper says, must be impossible to derive from a universal statement "without initial conditions," which effectively means that basic statements must be tied to specific real-world statements. Yet a basic statement must be able to contradict a universal statement. Thus, the negation of a basic statement cannot itself be a basic statement.
- A fine-grained discussion of the logic of such statements follows, with the conclusion that basic statements must be "singular existential statements": A hypothetical example, not used by Popper himself, might be, "There exists such-and-such a thing at such-and-such a time and place."
- These criteria, Popper continues, are still too narrow. It is also necessary to stipulate that basic statements be observable, or intersubjectively testable.
- Putting it all together, this means that basic statements are "statements asserting that an observable event is occurring in a certain individual region of space and time."
- Because basic statements can themselves be tested, Popper points out in Section 29, the investigator must decide when to stop testing and accept a given basic statement. "This procedure has no natural end" and the decision to stop is a methodological, not a logical one. It makes most sense to stop at basic statements that are easily testable should testing resume in the future.
- Thus, instead of infinite regress or psychologism, Popper proposes a kind of "innocuous" dogmatism in which certain basic statements are provisionally accepted as true. The corresponding process of testing is infinite in theory, but has clear stopping points in practice.
- Some broader methodological rules are still necessary to connect theory and experiment (Section 30). One such rule is the refusal to accept "stray" basic statements that have no logical connection to any particular theory. A science "needs point of view, and theoretical problems."
- It follows from this view that theoreticians take the lead in the development of science—they "formulate the questions" that experiments are designed to ask.
- At this point, Popper says, an answer can be given to "how and why" some theories are preferred over others. The preferred theory is that which "survives" the most rigorous testing and thus "holds its own in competition with other theories." This criterion is related to—yet distinct from—a theory's usefulness and simplicity.

# Part 2, Chapter 6 : Some Structural Components of a Theory of Experience (Degrees of Testability) | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- In this chapter Popper considers the sense in which one theory may be more or less testable (i.e., falsifiable) than another.
- In Section 31, returning to the definition of falsifiability from Chapter 4, Popper suggests that a theory is falsifiable in proportion to the number of basic statements it rules out—that is, the number of potential falsifiers it has. One theory is "falsifiable in a higher degree" than another if it has a larger class of potential falsifiers. The more falsifiable the theory, the greater its empirical content.
- Obtaining such easily falsifiable theories is, Popper remarks, a major goal of science.
- This statement raises the question of how one class of falsifiers can be said to be "larger" than another, since such classes are infinite (Section 32). Popper considers three mathematical approaches to the problem before proceeding with the _subclass relation_. A class α (for example, of potential falsifiers) is a _subclass_ of another class ß if all the elements of α are also elements of ß. When ß has some additional elements not found in α, α is said to be a _proper subclass_ of ß.
- In Section 33 Popper now applies the subclass relation to falsifiability. Statement _x_ is "falsifiable in a higher degree" than statement _y_ if _y_'s falsifiers are a proper subclass of _x_'s falsifiers.
- The implications of this statement are then explored. Tautological statements (statements that are redundant) have no falsifiers, so they are the least falsifiable; self-contradictory statements are falsified by any basic statement at all, so they are the most falsifiable.
- Next, in Section 34 Popper uses some illustrations from graph theory and set theory to show how subclass relations (and thus relations of testability and falsifiability) might operate within a given system of statements.
- Because two sets of falsifiers may intersect without one being a subset of the other, Popper remarks, it is not always possible to directly compare two statements in terms of their falsifiability.
- However, when two such statements can be compared, the comparison can also be couched in terms of probability: "The logical probability of a statement ... increases with decreasing degree of falsifiability."
- _Logical probability_ here captures the idea that the more specific a statement is, the less likely it is (generally speaking) to be true. The statement "It will rain today," for instance, is logically more probable than, "It will both rain and snow today," since the latter rules out more possibilities.
- In Section 35 Popper distinguishes between a statement's _empirical content_—what it "says about the world of experience"—and its _logical content_, which is the set of statements that can be derived from it.
- In Section 36 he then considers two more "methodological demands" that are satisfied by choosing the theory with the greatest empirical content: _universality_ and _precision_. Using an example from orbital mechanics and some symbolic statements from formal logic, he shows that a statement with greater precision, greater universality, or both must also be a statement with greater empirical content.
- The discussion of precision raises the issue of measurement, Popper says in Section 37. A given theory may predict results within a range set by the precision of the available measuring equipment. Yet attempts to specify the precision of an instrument threaten to produce an infinite regress, since the bounds of the range of imprecision are themselves imprecise. Consequently, the idea of precision is useful only when these bounds shrink with each iteration. However, Popper states that measurement with such "unsharp bounds" is still superior to a purely qualitative approach.
- In Section 38 Popper argues that, by analogy with dimensions in geometry, a theory can be assigned a higher or lower dimension based on the complexity of statements that falsify it. Lower-dimensional theories are more testable in the sense that they are falsified by simpler statements.
- This concept is then applied to a set of objects that have dimension in a more literal sense: geometric curves (Section 39). The immediate motivation here is that such curves are useful for characterizing planetary orbits. Thus, the dimension of an orbital path specified or prohibited by a theory becomes a proxy for the theory's dimension.
- In Section 40 Popper then suggests how, under certain circumstances, the dimension of a curve can be reduced. Again, the point here ultimately transcends geometry: Popper is illustrating the kinds of conceptual transformations by which the dimension of a theory can be reduced.

# Part 2, Chapter 7 : Some Structural Components of a Theory of Experience (Simplicity) | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- Popper now spends some time discussing a superficially appealing, but ultimately indefensible, characterization of what makes a scientific theory strong. "The idea of simplicity has been used uncritically," he argues, "as though it were quite obvious what simplicity is and why it should be valuable."
- In Section 41, to start, Popper does away with what he calls the "aesthetic" and "pragmatic" concepts of simplicity. He does not intend to discuss simplicity in the senses of, say, mathematical elegance or beauty on the one hand, or the ease with which an experiment may be conducted on the other.
- This leaves what Popper terms the "epistemological concept of simplicity"—if, he cautions, such a thing can be said to exist (Section 42). To see what such simplicity might look like, Popper considers the tendency to seek mathematically simple curves to model trends in measurements in the field of statistics. In this definition of "simple," a straight line is considered simpler than a parabola, for instance. But Popper finds that all the justifications given for adopting this definition boil down to aesthetic and pragmatic concerns.
- Popper also considers and rejects a definition of simplicity that is based on probability. He argues that this definition, too, is excessively vague and lacking in justification.
- In Section 43 comes Popper's own attempt to define simplicity in a way consistent with his notion of falsifiability. He argues that the simplest statements are those with the fewest parameters and consequently the most universal, the most precise, and the easiest to test. This definition of simplicity, though not as intuitive as the others, fulfills many important criteria. For instance, it explains why the search for "simple" theories is a worthwhile pursuit.
- In Section 44 Popper then takes a brief detour to show how this definition of simplicity applies to the shapes of geometric curves and the definition of mathematical functions.
- Section 45, closely related to Section 44, applies the concept of simplicity to geometry in general. Popper explains, from the viewpoint of testability, why (and in what sense) Euclidean geometry is rightly considered simpler than non-Euclidean geometries.
- In Section 46 he closes the chapter by explaining how his definition of simplicity differs from the way it is used by conventionalists (compare Sections 19 to 21). He argues that conventionalist efforts to defend an established theory end up making the theory more complex and less falsifiable.

# Part 2, Chapter 8 : Some Structural Components of a Theory of Experience (Probability) | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- Popper spends this chapter discussing probability theory and its various modern interpretations. He proposes a set of probability axioms that, in his view, solve some of the interpretive problems faced by scientists and philosophers.
- In Section 47 he first distinguishes _numerical_ probability statements (for example, "The probability of rolling a six with a fair die is 1/6.") from nonnumerical ones (for example, "This result is highly improbable."). Subsequent discussion will focus on the latter.
- In Section 48 Popper then divides major interpretations of probability theory into two groups: _subjective_ and _objective_. The subjective interpretations, which Popper also terms "psychologistic," are those that describe the probability of an event in terms of "certainty or uncertainty, of belief or doubt."
- A "variant" of the subjective interpretation, which Popper calls the _logico-subjective_ interpretation, describes the probability of a statement in terms of the extent to which "its content goes beyond" what is already known.
- In the _objective_ interpretation, the probability of an event describes "the _relative frequency_ with which an event of a certain kind occurs within a _sequence of occurrences_."
- Popper proposes to base his new probability theory on this _objective_ or _frequency_ interpretation. He argues that only such an interpretation can explain why probability theory should apply to empirical science.
- In Section 49 Popper considers a "fundamental problem" with probability. How can "a statement of ignorance, interpreted as a frequency statement ... be empirically tested and corroborated"? That is, how can the inability to predict the result of an _individual_ trial give rise to a declaration about the results of a _sequence_ of trials? Popper's theory will, he promises, address this problem.
- As a jumping-off point for his own theory, in Section 50 Popper describes the basic ideas of the widely accepted _frequency theory_ that relies on two axioms. The _axiom of convergence_ says, essentially, that as the number of trials grows larger, the frequency of a given event will get closer and closer to its actual probability. For instance, as the number of rolls of a (fair, six-sided) die increases, the frequency of 6's will get closer and closer to 1/6.
- The _axiom of randomness_ says, roughly, that a truly probabilistic sequence of events is immune to predictions or gambling systems. There is no way to "game" a probabilistic sequence to predict individual values.
- The remainder of the section is devoted to defining these axioms in more precise mathematical terms.
- In Section 51 Popper now explains how his theory will differ from the one just presented. He proposes to keep the axiom of randomness, though in modified form, and to abandon the axiom of convergence. The broad plan is to develop a "frequency theory for finite classes" and then extend it to the infinite case.
- In Section 52 Popper develops—and expresses in mathematical notation—a basic concept of relative frequency.
- In Section 53 he shows how this concept of relative frequency allows for one class (of objects, events, etc.) to be selected from another class. This, in turn, allows him to develop ideas of independence and irrelevance that closely match the use of those concepts in traditional probability theory.
- In Section 54 Popper details two types of selection that will be important for applying his frequency theory to infinite classes. One type is _ordinal selection_, where elements are chosen based on their position in a sequence; the other type is _neighborhood selection_, where elements are chosen based on the values adjacent (or near) to them.
- Using these concepts, in Section 55 Popper shows how sequences can be characterized as "_n_-free" with respect to arbitrarily large neighborhoods: that is, the value of an element in sequence α cannot be guessed even if the preceding _n_ values are known. The relation to probability may be easier to see if the situation is reversed: a sequence cannot be called random if an individual value can be predicted by looking at the past _n_ values.
- Combining ideas from the previous section, in Section 56 Popper derives a version of the binomial distribution formula, an algebraic test used in probability theory to determine the odds of a given number of tests resulting in a specific answer. Popper uses it to show how hypotheses can be defined, narrowed, and thus tested to determine their verifiability or falsifiability. Its most immediate application here is that it allows for a "translation" of sorts between a finite number of observed results and the probability of a given outcome.
- In Section 57 Popper generalizes the ideas from Sections 52 to 56 to infinite sequences and hypothetical frequencies.
- Next, in Section 58 Popper returns to the axiom of randomness, which he now proposes to replace by the weaker requirement of "absolute freedom." A sequence is sufficiently random for probability theory to apply if it is _n_-free (see Section 55) for any value of _n_. The rest of the section explains why this weaker requirement is sufficient and how its adoption addresses some criticisms of the axiom of randomness.
- In Section 59 Popper's definitions of _random_ and _objective probability_ are presented in summary form.
- With the basics of his theory sketched out, Popper doubles back in Section 60 to address a somewhat technical problem that seems to arise when _finite_ ideas of frequency are adapted to _infinite_ sequences.
- In Section 61 he then shows that the "law of great numbers" (also called the "law of large numbers") can be derived from theorems already presented. This law is so closely akin to the axiom of convergence that the latter no longer needs to be stipulated as an axiom.
- In Section 62 Popper now begins to show the advantages of this system as compared to subjective interpretations of probability theory. He argues that his objective theory, but not a subjective one, is capable of "bridging the gulf" between statistical observations and probabilistic conjectures.
- Next, in Section 63 he discusses the relationship between the law of large numbers (whose derivation Popper's system permits) and the axiom of convergence (whose adoption Popper wishes to avoid).
- Building on Section 63, in Section 64 Popper shows in detail why an axiom of convergence is unnecessary for an axiomatic, objective theory of probability.
- In Section 65 Popper then steps back to generalize. Whether or not his specific axiomatization is adopted, he says, a probability theory with certain well-accepted properties does not allow for its statements to be falsified: "Probability hypotheses _do not rule out anything observable_." Using a brief and rather abstract example, he shows why this is the case.
- In Section 66 Popper also gives a logical justification for the assertion that probability statements are neither falsifiable nor verifiable. He considers the implications of this situation in detail, paying particular attention to the limited inferences that can be made from a probability statement.
- In Section 67 Popper asks how, then, does the theory of probability relate to empirical science—specifically, to physics? Popper observes that much of modern physics involves an effort to relate large-scale "macro laws" to "micro events" that cannot be directly observed.
- Probability estimates provide one possible framework for this relationship: a sequence of observations can be said to match the proposed macro law with a probability arbitrarily close to 1. Because probability statements are non-falsifiable, however, "special precautions" are needed if macro laws are to be treated as having any explanatory power.
- One such "precaution" is "the methodological decision never to explain physical effects ... as accumulations of accidents" (Section 68). Given that decision, Popper suggests, it is acceptable in some cases to use probability statements as if they were empirical, even though strictly speaking they cannot be.
- In Section 69 Popper questions the commonsense distinction between events governed by natural "laws" and those that are subject to "chance." He argues that the latter are merely cases in which either (1) the initial conditions are not known precisely enough or (2) suitable laws have not been articulated for making inferences from those conditions.
- In Section 70 he also challenges the "doctrine" that "_all_ observable events must be explained as macro events," that is, as aggregations of micro events. The methodological _preference_ for macro-level explanations is reasonable, but statistical assumptions are necessary to go from the micro to the macro level.
- To illustrate this contention, Popper offers the example of a waterfall. In principle, the movement of small groups of water molecules can be predicted with precision. However, the overall behavior of the waterfall cannot be predicted simply by adding up groups of molecules. Such macro-level behavior can be characterized only with the help of statistical assumptions about how "many different groups of particles" will behave.
- In Section 71 Popper clarifies the meaning of "formally singular" probability statements—those that describe the probability of an individual event on a specific trial. (For instance: "The probability of throwing five on the next throw of this die is 1/6.") He shows how such statements can be reconciled with the classical requirement that probabilities be applied only to infinite sequences of events.
- In Section 72 the chapter ends with some remarks on the concept of _range_ and its relationship to probability. Loosely, a statement's logical _range_ can be identified with the class of logical possibilities the statement permits. As Popper shows, this is connected to the logical probability of the statement: a statement with a narrower range is easier to falsify, thus less logically probable.

# Part 2, Chapter 9 : Some Structural Components of a Theory of Experience (Some Observations on Quantum Theory) | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- In this chapter Popper sets out to apply his probability theory to problems in quantum physics. He recognizes that this is an "audacious" undertaking but suggests that answers to some scientific questions may be found "in the no-man's-land that lies between logic and physics." His main project here is to suggest problems with German physicist and philosopher Werner Heisenberg's (1901–76) uncertainty principle, which he views as not deducible from—and potentially even contradictory with—other results in quantum theory.
- In Section 73 Popper offers a brief explanation of both the motivations and the content of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, which states that it is impossible to measure the precise position and velocity of an atomic-scale object at the same time. He argues that this principle has been interpreted inconsistently, and with contradictory results, by those who subscribe to it.
- Next, in Section 74 he sketches out the "statistical interpretation" of quantum theory. According to this interpretation, quantum equations provide statistical—that is to say, probabilistic—answers to physical questions. For example, quantum equations can specify the probability of finding a particle (for example, an electron) within a given region of space (for example, a given distance from its atomic nucleus).
- This interpretation, Popper says, is sometimes justified by referring to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Such justification is erroneous, he argues: Heisenberg's principle can be deduced from other (appropriately interpreted) quantum equations, but not vice versa.
- In Section 75 Popper now gets a little more specific about the previous point. Heisenberg's _formulae_ can be logically derived from the rest of quantum theory, but their interpretation as an _uncertainty principle_ follows only if a specific interpretation is applied to quantum theory at large. He argues that under specific conditions, and given a statistical interpretation of quantum theory, it is not necessary to regard Heisenberg's formulae as limiting the precision with which a particle's position and velocity can be known.
- In Section 76 Popper then attempts to work back through Heisenberg's key ideas with the assumption that quantum theory is a body of statistical statements. On this assumption, he continues, quantum theory does not "_rule out_ exact measurements," in somewhat the same way as the hypothesis "This die is fair," does not rule out rolling the die and noticing that one particular roll is a six. At the same time, and for the same basic reason, a statistically interpreted quantum theory cannot make precise predictions in individual cases. It cannot say what number the die will show on the next roll.
- Next, in Section 77 Popper presents a thought experiment designed to answer potential objections to his argument. The experiment purports to show that quantum theory is not incompatible with "exact singular _predictions_" of the position and velocity of particles. This experiment, Popper acknowledges in the 1959 version of his book, is based on erroneous premises. He claims, however, that the principle illustrated by the experiment is still valid.
- In this final section, Section 78, Popper pulls back to address a broader trend in scientific thought. He criticizes the tendency to assume that "whenever ... frequency statements are well confirmed ... _no precision statements can be made_." This latter assertion, which Popper describes as _indeterminism_, seems to him to be a metaphysical belief rather than an empirical hypothesis.
- Ultimately, he concedes, the belief in causality is itself metaphysical, but such a belief is more "fertile" for scientific research than is any form of indeterminism.

# Part 2, Chapter 10 : Some Structural Components of a Theory of Experience (Corroboration, or How a Theory Stands Up to Tests) | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- If empirical statements are impossible to verify even in principle, what can actually be said about scientific theories? Popper spends this final chapter developing an answer to this question. He argues that although experimentation cannot establish a theory as true or even possible, a theory can still be "corroborated."
- In Section 79 Popper first does away with the idea of verification. He argues that the method of induction—perhaps the most fundamental way by which experimental evidence supposedly proves theories—is itself neither verifiable nor falsifiable.
- In Section 80 he then turns to the so-called _probability logic_ by which induction allegedly shows that theories are at least "probable." He argues that the entire concept of probability is misapplied in this case.
- In Section 81 Popper then raises the question: What if theories _could_ be established as probable? What would this mean and what would it imply? He contends that describing a theory as probable merely defers, but does not solve, the problem of induction. Thus, the hypothetical statement, not used by Popper, "Theory X is probably true," is necessarily unverifiable. If the statement is a true one, there is no empirical way of showing it. On the other hand, if the statement "Theory X is probably true," is itself merely probable, an infinite regress results. An investigation must be made of the probability (or truth) of the statement, "The statement that Theory X is probably true is probably true," and so forth.
- Instead, Popper says in Section 82, scientists must accept—and utilize—the fact that experiments _corroborate_ theories. A theory that has stood up to severe attempts at disproof is to be accepted over one that has never been tested. This, Popper emphasizes, is a _methodological_ decision for which purely logical grounds cannot be given.
- Returning to a point from Section 80, in Section 83 Popper argues that in an important sense, the most highly testable theories are actually the _least_ probable.
- In Section 84 he makes some definitional remarks about the relationship between "corroborated" and "true"/"false." He recognizes that some thinkers will wish to "define 'truth' in terms of the success of a theory—and thus of its usefulness," or "of its confirmation or ... corroboration." Popper rejects this usage as unproductive and likely to cause confusion.
- In Section 85 Popper admits that physics overall has seemed to move in an "'inductive' direction," from less universal theories to more universal ones. This does not, he cautions, mean that physics has progressed via "a sequence of inductive inferences." Rather, he says, this directional trend is closely related to the testability of theories. As scientists' ability to test theories grows more sophisticated, it is possible to decide among ever more universal theories.

## Key Takeaways

- In Appendix 1 Popper returns to, and elaborates upon, the concept of "dimension" used in Sections 38 and 39. The definition given here is somewhat more formal than that presented in the main text and relies on concepts from set theory.
- In Appendix 2 Popper gives a much more technical exposition of the idea of "frequency" and "frequency classes" used in his proofs from Sections 52 to 53.
- Likewise, in Appendix 3 he presents a formal derivation of the binomial formula, filling in a process that is sketched out in Section 56.
- In the process of developing the notion of a random sequence (Section 58), Popper alluded to a "model" of such a sequence—that is, a sequence with random behavior, but made according to specific mathematical rules. Here, in Appendix 4 he gives the method of construction in detail.
- In Appendix 5 Popper describes an imaginary experiment involving photons that seems to support the Heisenberg uncertainty principle (compare with Section 76). He then explains why he views this experiment as failing to do so.
- In Appendix 6 Popper then provides more detail on his own proposed experiment (described in Section 77) and explains why he regards it as a legitimate challenge to Heisenberg's theories.
- The experiment from Section 77 is laid out in a greater degree of mathematical formality in Appendix 7.

# New Appendices to 1959 Edition | Summary

## Key Takeaways

- In Appendix 1 Popper reprints two notes from the mid-1930s that summarize his early criticism of induction and his interest in the problem of _demarcation_—of determining what sets scientific knowledge apart from other kinds.
- In Appendix 2 Popper presents a revised version of his probability axioms (compare with Chapter 8), along with the discussion of those axioms from a 1938 paper.
- Next, in Appendix 3 Popper shows how the classical theory of probability can be used as a stepping stone toward more general (and thus more robust) theories. In particular, he shows how the classical definition can be used to derive the _general multiplication rule_, which explains how to find the probability of two events occurring on the same trial.
- In Appendix 4 Popper sets forth the axioms and definitions of his formal probability theory in more detail (compare Appendix 2 from the 1959 edition). Concepts from algebra, set theory, and elementary calculus play a role in this exposition of Popper's system, which is somewhat more rigorous than its presentation in Appendix 2 (1959) or in the main text.
- Appendix 5 is perhaps the most technical of those dealing with Popper's theory of probability. It provides, with relatively little commentary, line-by-line derivations of the theory's major results. Notation from formal logic features heavily.
- In Appendix 6 Popper explains how his theory characterizes "randomness as a type of order." He begins with some commonsense concepts of randomness and shows why these are lacking in rigor or generality. Throughout the discussion, he returns to the "ideally random sequence" developed in the early sections of Chapter 8 and further defined in Appendix 4 (1934 edition).
- In Appendix 7 Popper now provides more reasons for rejecting the view that a well-corroborated hypothesis is a more "probable" one. He explains that, in fact, "the probability of any (non-tautological) universal law will be zero." A mathematical demonstration of this assertion and its consequences follows. An attempt is made, and a notation introduced, to describe the smallest possible differences in the logical content—and thus the logical probability—of a pair of statements.
- In Appendix 8 Popper gives a more precise characterization of the "content" or "simplicity" of a theory. He argues that "for a sufficiently large finite universe," the theory with "the greater number of parameters will always be more probable" than "the theory with the smaller number of parameters." The improbability of simple theories is reaffirmed.
- In Appendix 9 Popper reprints three notes in which he formalizes the idea of a theory's "degree of corroboration" and shows once more why this degree cannot be conflated with a theory's "probability."
- In Appendix 10 Popper attacks inductivism from another angle, contending that repeated observations cannot justify the acceptance of (or even the belief in) a universal law. He argues that what counts as a "repetition" is always to some degree approximate and subjective; moreover, in general it is impossible to prove that a universal law applies to even one instance (for example, that one piece of iron is really made of atoms). In illustrating these claims, Popper develops a formal concept of "logical necessity" that is related to—but distinct from—ordinary logical implication.
- Popper calls for some consistency in the use of imaginary experiments in Appendix 11. He argues that imaginary experiments, like other tools of investigation, should be used to challenge and criticize theories, and secondarily, to explain them. They should not be used to _defend_ theories. Illustrations from recent quantum physics research are provided.
- Appendix 12 includes a reprinted 1935 letter from German-born physicist Albert Einstein (1879–1955). In it, Einstein refutes the experiment described in Section 77 and voices some disagreements with Popper about the role of probabilistic reasoning in physics.

 > Whenever we propose a solution to a problem, we ought to try ... to overthrow our solution. 

Narrator, [Preface to the First English Edition, 1959](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Logic-of-Scientific-Discovery/preface-to-the-first-english-edition-1959-summary/)

Throughout _The Logic of Scientific Discovery_ Popper will be engaged in an effort to integrate scientific _logic_ with scientific _methodology_. Here, he makes a methodological point about the ways in which a scientific theory should be tested. Those who come up with such theories, he says, should scrutinize and test them as severely as possible. They should focus on finding reasons to reject the new theory, not reasons to accept it.

2.

> I never assume that by force of 'verified' conclusions, theories can be established as 'true.' 

Narrator, [Part 1, Chapter 1](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Logic-of-Scientific-Discovery/part-1-chapter-1-summary/)

Here, Popper breaks with the ideas of _inductivism_ and _verificationism_, two perspectives he opposes throughout _The Logic of Scientific Discovery_. Unlike the verificationists, Popper is willing to admit that a wide variety of statements—including many nonempirical, or unobservable, ones—can be meaningful. Unlike the inductivists, Popper does not believe that any amount of evidence can prove a scientific theory once and for all.

3.

> It must be possible for an empirical scientific system to be refuted by experience. 

Narrator, [Part 1, Chapter 1](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Logic-of-Scientific-Discovery/part-1-chapter-1-summary/)

This statement is Popper's criterion of _falsifiability_ expressed in simple language. It's important to note that Popper is not calling unfalsifiable statements _meaningless_. Rather, he is making the much more limited assertion that such statements cannot be called _empirical_ or _scientific_. An unfalsifiable statement may be meaningful and even important, but it cannot serve as a scientific hypothesis.

4.

> Not for nothing do we call ... laws of nature 'laws:' the more they prohibit the more they say. 

Narrator, [Part 1, Chapter 1](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Logic-of-Scientific-Discovery/part-1-chapter-1-summary/)

This statement encapsulates Popper's objection to the idea that a hypothesis becomes more probable the more it is tested without falsification. The most testable hypotheses, he argues, are actually the least probable inasmuch as they can be falsified by the largest number of possible statements.

5.

> If you insist on strict proof ... in the empirical sciences, you will never benefit from experience. 

Narrator, [Part 1, Chapter 2](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Logic-of-Scientific-Discovery/part-1-chapter-2-summary/)

Here, Popper adds some nuance to the criterion of falsifiability. He argues that although falsifiability is important in principle, in practice, a person can never be entirely sure that a theory has been falsified. It is always possible, for instance, that the falsifying experiment was itself unreliable or inaccurate. The game of science never truly ends.

6.

> Theories are nets cast to catch what we call 'the world:' to rationalize, ... explain, and ... master it. 

Narrator, [Part 2, Chapter 3](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Logic-of-Scientific-Discovery/part-2-chapter-3-summary/)

It is important, Popper argues, to acknowledge that scientific theories have some connection to "the world" even if those theories can never be said to give a definitive and accurate picture of natural phenomena. The metaphor of a net captures this well: there will always be gaps in a scientific theory, but progress consists in making these gaps smaller over time.

7.

> The naive empiricist ... thinks that we begin by collecting and arranging our experiences. 

Narrator, [Part 2, Chapter 5](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Logic-of-Scientific-Discovery/part-2-chapter-5-summary/)

In the broadest sense _The Logic of Scientific Discovery_ calls for a reversal in the philosophy of science. Instead of describing how scientific knowledge is built up, Popper argues that the philosopher's true task is to describe how scientific theories are tested. Much of Chapter 5 is devoted to critiquing the commonsense view that knowledge follows directly from experience.

8.

> Science does not rest upon solid bedrock. The bold structure of its theories rises ... above a swamp. 

Narrator, [Part 2, Chapter 5](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Logic-of-Scientific-Discovery/part-2-chapter-5-summary/)

With this colorful metaphor of a swamp, Popper calls attention to the ongoing and incomplete nature of the scientific enterprise. If, as he asserts, theories can never be proven, there is no possibility of reaching "solid bedrock" from which all of science can be securely inferred. Instead, the process of scientific progress involves not only building upward but also sinking the foundations deeper and deeper. Theories must not merely be accumulated, they must also be tested with ever-increasing rigor.

9.

> We should try to find strict laws—prohibitions—that can founder upon experience. 

Narrator, [Part 2, Chapter 9](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Logic-of-Scientific-Discovery/part-2-chapter-9-summary/)

Popper here distinguishes between two kinds of _prohibitions_. He has argued throughout the book that scientific theories are essentially prohibitory in character: a _law of nature_ is a statement that outlaws many imaginable phenomena. Such prohibitions, however, are always provisional—they can "founder" (that is, fail) in the face of experimental evidence and can thus be overturned.

10.

> The old scientific ideal of epistēmē—of absolutely certain, demonstrable knowledge—has proved to be an idol. 

Narrator, [Part 2, Chapter 10](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/The-Logic-of-Scientific-Discovery/part-2-chapter-10-summary/)

Toward the close of the main text, Popper describes the situation of scientific knowledge in somewhat broader terms. Total certainty, he argues, is impossible in scientific matters. It would be easy to see this as a discouraging state of affairs, but it doesn't have to be. Instead, Popper closes the book with the observation that science is capable of growing ever deeper and more rigorous, even if it can never produce perfect proof of the theories it adopts.

# Glossary

**all-statement:** _(n)_ Popper's term for what is also known as a "strictly universal statement." All-statements are "universal assertion[s] about an unlimited number of individuals" and include, for instance, the laws of physics.

**axiom:** _(n)_ a fundamental, universal statement that forms the core of a theoretical system. Popper sets forth several criteria for axiomatized systems in Chapter 3.

**basic statement:** _(n)_ a statement whose truth or falsehood is determined by a direct appeal to experience, not by appealing to other statements. Popper further requires that basic statements concern independently observable phenomena.

**corroborate:** _(v)_ to support or confirm. Popper distinguishes between corroboration and direct confirmation of a theory: tests that fail to falsify a theory corroborate it but do not "prove" or verify it.

**deduction:** _(n)_ the process of drawing specific conclusions from general principles. Popper champions what he calls deductivism as superior to inductivism.

**epistemology:** _(n)_ the philosophical study of knowledge. Popper's book itself is a work on the epistemology of science.

**falsifiable:** _(adj)_ able to be proven false by a basic statement. Popper regards falsifiability as a basic characteristic of scientific statements and theories.

**hypostatization:** _(n)_ the treatment of an abstract belief or concept as if it were real. Popper uses this term to critique the tendency of some thinkers to treat human rules and conventions as if they were laws of nature.

**hypothesis:** _(n)_ a proposed explanation for an observed phenomenon. To call a statement a hypothesis is not to imply that it has been tested, though a scientific hypothesis is at least testable.

**induction:** _(n)_ the process of drawing general conclusions from individual observations. Popper denies that induction can provide a sound basis for scientific knowledge.

**metaphysical:** _(adj)_ abstract, not referable to concrete experience. Although the term "metaphysical" has many uses in philosophy, Popper applies it to an important class of philosophical statements that are not falsifiable and thus not scientific.

**modus ponens:** _(n)_ a rule of classical logic that says, "If P implies Q, and P is true, then Q must also be true." For example: "The mail is not delivered on holidays. Today is a holiday; therefore, the mail will not be delivered today."

**modus tollens:** _(n)_ a rule of classical logic that says, "If P implies Q, and Q is false, then P must also be false." For example: "If it snows more than six inches, school will be canceled. Therefore, if school has not been canceled, it has not snowed more than six inches."

**theory:** _(n)_ a systematic explanation for some set of phenomena, for example, the atomic theory of physics or the germ theory of disease. An explanation is generally regarded as a theory when it has stood up to extensive testing and covers a wide range of related phenomena.

**verifiable:** _(adj)_ able to be proven true by a basic statement. Popper denies that a scientific theory or hypothesis can ever be verifiable (he admits only that they can be corroborated), though he requires that such statements be falsifiable.

# Biography

### Early Years

Karl Popper was born July 28, 1902, in Vienna, Austria. The city of Vienna, a cultural and intellectual hub at the time, was a favorable environment for such a young intellectual as Popper. It was home to influential groups in art history, economics, philosophy, mathematics, and science. Popper studied at the realgymnasium, a traditional German-style high school. He dropped out at age 16, however, and began studying informally at the University of Vienna, where he finally enrolled in 1922. Popper worked his way through an eclectic curriculum that included psychology but also mathematics and physics. He left the university with a deep admiration for German American physicist Albert Einstein (1879–1955), who had lectured publicly in Vienna in 1922.

### Career

In 1930 Popper married Josefine Henninger (1906–85). Seven years later, as the Nazi persecution of German Jews intensified, Popper began working internationally. Meanwhile, the _Anschluss_—Nazi Germany's annexation of Austria—loomed on the horizon. Popper, whose four grandparents were Jewish and would have been seen as such by the Nazis though he was a baptized Lutheran, watched the events of World War II (1939–1945) unfold from the relative safety of New Zealand. In New Zealand he taught in the philosophy department at the University of Canterbury. He spent eight years there and then moved to England in 1945 to take a position at the London School of Economics. He remained there for a quarter century and became a full professor in 1949.

Popper was, and is, best known for the ideas he presented in _The Logic of Scientific Discovery_, first published in German as _Logik der Forschung_ (1934). This book challenged some fundamental tenets in the philosophy of science and proposed a radical shift in that field's research program, from "How are scientific theories created?" to "How are such theories adopted and tested?" Popper received several major accolades for his work. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II (b. 1926) in 1965 and elected to the Royal Society in 1976. Although he officially retired in 1969, he continued to write and teach for many years thereafter.

### Legacy

At the time of his death, September 17, 1994, Popper was widely acknowledged as a major figure in both political philosophy and the philosophy of science. In both fields, his works opened up long-held philosophical dogmas to productive debate and helped philosophers engage with the cultural developments of the 20th century.
