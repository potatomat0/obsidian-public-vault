Chauvinism is the unreasonable belief in the superiority or dominance of one's own group or people, who are seen as strong and virtuous, while others are considered weak, unworthy, or inferior. The Encyclopaedia Britannica describes it as a form of excessive and unreasonable patriotism and nationalism, a fervent faith in national excellence and glory.

In English, the word has also come to be used in some quarters as shorthand for male chauvinism, a trend reflected in Merriam-Webster's Dictionary, which, as of 2018, began its first example of use of the term chauvinism with "an attitude of superiority toward members of the opposite sex"

# As nationalism 
According to legend, French soldier [Nicolas Chauvin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Chauvin "Nicolas Chauvin") was badly wounded in the [Napoleonic Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars "Napoleonic Wars") and received a meager pension for his injuries. After [Napoleon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon "Napoleon") abdicated, Chauvin maintained his fanatical [Bonapartist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonapartism "Bonapartism") belief in the messianic mission of [Imperial France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_French_Empire "First French Empire"), despite the unpopularity of this view under the [Bourbon Restoration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_Restoration_in_France "Bourbon Restoration in France"). His single-minded devotion to his cause, despite neglect by his faction and harassment by its enemies, started the use of the term.

_Chauvinism_ has extended from its original use to include fanatical devotion and undue partiality to any group or cause to which one belongs, especially when such [partisanship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partisan_(political) "Partisan (political)") includes prejudice against or hostility toward outsiders or rival groups and persists even in the face of overwhelming opposition. This French quality finds its parallel in the English-language term _[jingoism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingoism "Jingoism")_, which has retained the meaning of _chauvinism_ strictly in its original sense; that is, an attitude of belligerent nationalism
In 1945, political theorist [Hannah Arendt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Arendt "Hannah Arendt") described the concept thus:

> Chauvinism is an almost natural product of the national concept in so far as it springs directly from the old idea of the "national mission". ... [A] nation's mission might be interpreted precisely as bringing its light to other, less fortunate peoples that, for whatever reason, have miraculously been left by history without a national mission. As long as this concept did not develop into the ideology of chauvinism and remained in the rather vague realm of national or even nationalistic pride, it frequently resulted in a high sense of responsibility for the welfare of backward people.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chauvinism#cite_note-9)

In this sense, chauvinism is irrational, in that no one can claim their nation or ethnic group to be inherently superior to another. An example of a modern-day [English nationalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_nationalism "English nationalism") extreme enough to be considered a chauvinist is [Nigel Farage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Farage "Nigel Farage").

### Causes

Chauvinist assumptions are seen by some as a bias in the [TAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thematic_Apperception_Test "Thematic Apperception Test") psychological personality test. Through cross-examinations, the TAT exhibits a tendency toward chauvinistic stimuli for its questions and has the "potential for unfavorable clinical evaluation" for women
An often cited study done in 1976 by Sherwyn Woods, "Some Dynamics of Male Chauvinism", attempts to find the underlying causes of male chauvinism.

> Male chauvinism was studied in the [psychoanalytic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalytic "Psychoanalytic") therapy of 11 men. It refers to the maintenance of fixed beliefs and attitudes of male superiority, associated with overt or covert depreciation of women. Challenging chauvinist attitudes often results in anxiety or other symptoms. It is frequently not investigated in psychotherapy because it is ego-syntonic, parallels cultural attitudes, and because therapists often share similar bias or neurotic conflict. Chauvinism was found to represent an attempt to ward off anxiety and shame arising from one or more of four prime sources: unresolved infantile strivings and regressive wishes, hostile envy of women, oedipal anxiety, and power and dependency conflicts related to masculine [self-esteem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-esteem "Self-esteem"). [Mothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother "Mother") were more important than fathers in the development of male chauvinism, and resolution was sometimes associated with [decompensation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompensation#Psychology "Decompensation") in wives.[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chauvinism#cite_note-18)

Adam Jukes argues that a reason for male chauvinism is [masculinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masculinity "Masculinity") itself:

> For the vast majority of people all over the world, the mother is a primary carer...There's an asymmetry in the development of boys and girls. Infant boys have to learn how to be masculine. Girls don't. Masculinity is not in a state of crisis. Masculinity is a crisis. I don't believe [misogyny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny "Misogyny") is innate, but I believe it's inescapable because of the development of masculinity.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chauvinism#cite_note-19)
