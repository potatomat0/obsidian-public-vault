## Overview

### Author

Soren Kierkegaard

### Year Published

1843

### Type

Religious Text

### Genre

Allegory, Philosophy, Religion

### At a Glance

Søren Kierkegaard wrote _Fear and Trembling_ at least partially to dispute the Danish reception of the beliefs of German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831). Kierkegaard saw Danish Hegelianism as squeezing the life out of true religion and turning the Danish State Church into a conformist bureaucracy without the inner passion of the early Christian faith. Kierkegaard saw himself as on a mission to "introduce Christianity into Christendom," and some might say the book continues to serve that purpose today, but in a much broader sense.

Kierkegaard is also considered to be the "father of existentialism," which can be broadly defined as a philosophical position arguing that an individual in every moment is free to choose what it means to be human. _Fear and Trembling_ is written from an existential standpoint. However, it also brings to light that in every moment, people choose how they will conduct their relationship with God or the absolute and that it might be fruitful to do so more consciously.

### About the Title

The title of the book is taken from Philippians 2:12 of the Bible's New Testament. In it Saint Paul addresses the Christian community at Philippi, admonishing them to continue to work out their salvation with "fear and trembling." _Fear_ in this context is commonly interpreted as awe and respect for God's majesty and dread for the loss of salvation. In _Fear and Trembling_ Kierkegaard refers to the fact that people who have stepped outside the boundaries of conventional morality after making a leap of faith will rarely turn into "unbridled beasts" and are more likely to be among those who know "how to speak with fear and trembling." The title perhaps also refers to the anxiety that people feel when they realize they have absolute responsibility for their own lives.

# Main Ideas

## The Highest Level of Existence Is Absolute Relation to the Absolute

The main idea of _Fear and Trembling_ is that the individual who is in absolute relation to the absolute is on a higher level than the person who simply lives in the universal, that is, according to society's ethics. While _Fear and Trembling_ works on many levels, on one level it is a polemic, or aggressive attack, against the Danish Hegelians of Kierkegaard's time, who were also prominent Christians. In Kierkegaard's view these Christian Hegelians had been seduced by Hegel's idea of an Absolute Mind, which can be seen, from a religious perspective, as God and from a philosophical perspective, as reason. According to Hegel world history, which comprises the histories of individual societies moves toward the Absolute Mind. Thus, outward manifestations of the universal—represented by the church and the state—also move toward the Absolute Mind. This movement of the historical dialectic was relentless as well as inevitable. In Hegel's view the highest level to which a human being could aspire is the level of the universal and its ethics, as represented by social institutions. For example, prominent Hegelian H.L. Martensen, a theologian and later bishop of the Lutheran Evangelical Church, also known as the Danish State Church, believed that individual subjectivity should ultimately be replaced by the "objective reason" of the church and state, an idea that Kierkegaard vehemently opposed. The premise of _Fear and Trembling_ is that an individual religious conscience can, in particular instances, hold more moral authority than established social ethics.

Kierkegaard uses Abraham, the father of the Jewish people, as an example of someone who makes a leap of faith and puts themselves above the universal, thus putting themselves in absolute relationship to the absolute (i.e., God). In the story of "The Binding of Isaac" in Chapter 22 of Genesis in the Hebrew Bible, God commands Abraham to take his son Isaac to Mount Moriah and sacrifice him as a burnt offering. God is testing Abraham's faith. Abraham willingly follows God's command. In Kierkegaard's view Abraham's actions are a "teleological suspension of the ethical." In his absolute duty to love God, Abraham supersedes the morals and mores of his time. Thus, he is not wrong to sacrifice Isaac as God has demanded. God saves Isaac at the last minute, but in Kierkegaard's view Abraham would have been no less wrong if God had allowed Isaac to die.

Kierkegaard's narrator, Johannes, also mentions the admonitions found in the Gospel of Luke, in which Jesus says that if people want to follow him, they must learn to hate their loved ones and even their own lives. This is a terrible text, says Johannes, which reiterates the extent of what God demands in the way of absolute love. While the absolute duty to God can lead a person to do what human ethics forbids, this duty does not make the knight of faith stop loving whom he loves, even if he has to kill that person for God's sake, as in the case of Abraham.

Kierkegaard is often called the father of existentialism because he is the first to clearly articulate the idea that there is no right way to be human and that each individual person is responsible for both defining the meaning of their lives and becoming human on their own terms. The knowledge of this terrible responsibility, which caused Kierkegaard anxiety, is what keeps people up at night. This absolute responsibility to life, which in a religious context may be called an absolute duty to the absolute, is a higher calling than one's responsibility to the universal or societal ethics. Such a view can be dangerous and be used to justify immoral behavior. But without this view of the absolute duty to the absolute, the world would lose the benefit of its visionaries—for example, a Martin Luther King, Jr. or a Mahatma Gandhi—who heeded a call to goodness higher than the status quo and changed society for the better as a result.

## Faith Is a Paradox of Willingly Embracing the Absurd

A parallel of the first main idea is that achieving absolute relation to the absolute requires embracing the absurd. Kierkegaard recognizes three spheres of existence: the aesthetic, in which one lives on the level of the body; the ethical, in which one lives on the level of the social contract; and the religious, in which one forgoes a mediated life and enters into direct relationship with the absolute. But to choose the third option, as Abraham does, means accepting the paradox of faith and having the willingness to embrace the absurd.

Faith does not follow the rules of logic, and in fact it cannot be explained. When a person begins to attempt to explain faith, they immediately fall back into the universal. Thus Abraham must remain silent about God's demand that he sacrifice his son. If he were to tell Isaac or Sarah what he plans to do, two things could happen: first, they might immediately try to stop him by pointing out that he has a choice and need not sacrifice Isaac. He can refuse to follow God's commandment. But to disobey God would mean to shirk his absolute duty to his beloved deity. The second thing that could happen is that Abraham's loved ones would call him a hypocrite. Abraham might insist that he loves Isaac, but his actions in the realm of the universal would contradict such assertions. In summary, Abraham has no choice but to remain silent about what he intends to do.

Moreover, Abraham's absolute faith in God means that while he believes God requires him to sacrifice his son, he also believes that God will not allow Isaac to die. These two beliefs are contradictory and paradoxical. Because of his faith in God, Abraham must resign himself to what God has commanded. At the same time, because of his faith in God, Abraham must believe that God will keep his promise to raise a great nation through Isaac: either God will not take Isaac, or he will bring him back to life. Thus Abraham performs a double movement—first becoming a knight of infinite resignation and then becoming a knight of faith. As a knight of faith he can receive back from God the gift of Isaac and, because he knew all along that God would not fail him, be immediately healed of the pain of that possibility of separation. Such is the power of Abraham's leap of faith and his willingness to embrace the absurd. This paradox reveals the limits of human reason in matters of faith.

## Infinite Resignation Is a Heroic Response to Life

Another main idea emerging from _Fear and Trembling_ is that infinite resignation is a heroic response to the difficulty and pain of life. Kierkegaard points out that becoming a knight of infinite resignation is only a steppingstone to becoming a knight of faith. Nevertheless, the author devotes considerable time to examining the psyche of the knight of infinity or infinite resignation. Kierkegaard also indicates that to surrender to the disappointment of life by surrendering to the higher will of the infinite is a heroic act. The narrator of _Fear and Trembling_ also seems to imply that the tragic hero is a knight of infinite resignation. The hero's ability and willingness to sacrifice their own happiness for the good of the state or another is an admirable act. And while not all knights of infinite resignation are tragic heroes, tragic heroes all must be tempered in the crucible of disappointment.

The narrator's primary example of the knight of infinite resignation is the young man who falls in love with a princess and desires to be with her, even though it is impossible. The knight will risk everything for his desire. If he fails, he will not forget what he wished for, keeping the pain of his thwarted desire alive in memory. While it may not be possible to have the princess, it is possible to channel the love he has for her into a higher ideal, remaking it as a spiritual "love for the eternal being." He is thus "reconciled ... in the eternal consciousness of his love's validity ... that no reality can take from him." Infinite resignation brings peace to the knight, and the pain of resignation can be a consolation.

The tragic hero is somewhat like the knight of resignation, in that they must make a sacrifice for the sake of the common good and resign themselves to fate in the process. Johannes provides a few examples, such as Agamemnon's sacrifice of his daughter Iphigenia. An angry god demands the sacrifice so that the Greeks may get a fair wind to take them to war against Troy. Agamemnon is the Greek general, and he is duty-bound to fight the Trojans and get back Helen, who has been abducted by Paris. While the idea of killing his daughter is monstrous, Agamemnon's need to carry out the sacrifice is understood by his society and even his daughter. Thus, the deed is sanctioned, unlike Abraham's deed. Nonetheless, the tragic hero must resign himself to his duty, and his resignation is heroic.

# Context

## Kierkegaard and Danish Christianity

Søren [Kierkegaard](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Fear-and-Trembling/author/) had more than a passing acquaintance with fraught relationships, and for a time he was estranged from both his father and his religion. In his early college years he became alienated from the Danish National Lutheran Church (his father's church) and state-supported Christianity. He briefly took up a hedonistic, or pleasure-seeking, lifestyle but then reclaimed Christianity and even began preparations for becoming a pastor. In a further development he turned his back on the state church and took it upon himself to become a defender of Christianity. He wrote in his journal that his mission was to "introduce Christianity into Christendom," while claiming in the last year of his life, "I dare not call myself a Christian." Nonetheless, he saw himself as a defender of true Christianity, and the latter statement shows that ultimately Kierkegaard was extremely humble about his own ability to have faith as he understood it. This humility is also reflected in Kierkegaard's changing cast of narrators in his treatises, who take pains to inform the reader about their own ignorance or lack of faith.

Kierkegaard turned against the Danish church because he believed it had become a haven for conformity and passionless humanism. He found its message to be more secular than sacred, locating the problem in the church hierarchy. He held particular dislike for Hans Lassen Martensen (1808–84), one of Kierkegaard's tutors from his university days, who later became a Lutheran bishop. Martensen was part of a group of Danish intellectuals who had embraced certain notions put forward by German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831). Hegel argued that philosophy was higher than religion and that [God](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Fear-and-Trembling/key-figure-analysis/#God) was not a separate being but the fullest reality emerging from a limited reality (the world and ourselves). Thus, there was no place in Hegel's philosophy for a private relationship with God. Following Hegel, Martensen discounted religious subjectivity, or an individual's direct spiritual experience or apprehension of religious truth. Martensen wanted to replace religious subjectivity with Hegelian reasoning as understood and dictated by the church and state. Kierkegaard believed this approach was very far from the meaning of original Christianity, and thus he launched a series of attacks on Christian Hegelianism in his various books.

In _Fear and Trembling_ it is sometimes hard to distinguish when Kierkegaard—through his fictional narrator, Johannes—is attacking Hegel's philosophy and when he is attacking Hegelian contemporaries whose philosophies are not identical with Hegel's. The distinction between Hegel and the Danish Hegelians becomes especially important to the reader when [Johannes](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Fear-and-Trembling/key-figure-analysis/#Johannes) accuses the Hegelians of wrongly calling [Abraham](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Fear-and-Trembling/key-figure-analysis/#Abraham) the father of faith. Instead, Johannes implies, the Hegelians have no use for faith but only for the ethics of the universal, that is, society's morals. In fact, Hegel never called Abraham the father of faith. Rather, Hegel speaks about Abraham in unflattering terms and sees Judaism as a steppingstone to Christianity, which he sees as a higher form of religion. But when Kierkegaard, through his narrator, says Hegel is wrong, he is criticizing Christian theologians of his day who follow their own version of Hegelian philosophy. Kierkegaard says they contradict themselves in saying that Abraham is the father of faith.

## Kierkegaard and Hegel

Hegel himself comes in for some criticism in _Fear and Trembling_. Hegel's philosophy is a comprehensive system of dialectics, a form of philosophical argument presented by contrasting two opposing concepts. In the course of the argument, opposite ideas (called thesis and antithesis) are resolved into a synthesis. Hegel claims that each new synthesis is not a resolution or final truth, but just one synthesis in a long, continuous process of thesis-antithesis-syntheses, until a proposition is resolved in the ultimate synthesis, or the "Absolute Idea." Thus, when Johannes protests this system, he is making fun of both Hegel and the Hegelians. Johannes claims not to be a philosopher. He does not understand what he calls "the System" or whether the system has been completed.

Moreover, in Kierkegaard's view, even if faith could be rendered in a conceptual form, that would not mean the philosopher had grasped faith. Nor could this conceptual synthesis show how a person came to faith. Hegel claims that his own philosophy is Christian, but his views include the idea of _sittlichkeit_, or the highest social ethic. _Sittlichkeit_ operates in the realm of the universal. But, Kierkegaard argues, faith is a paradox that puts the individual in a higher place than the universal. Furthermore, in Hegel's philosophy, religion—and by extension faith—ranks lower than philosophy. Thus, in Kierkegaard's view, Hegel and Hegel's followers cannot possibly be true Christians.

Even though Kierkegaard criticizes Hegel, he also admires him and builds aspects of his own philosophy using some of Hegel's ideas. For example, Kierkegaard revises Hegel's notion of religious and aesthetic consciousness in order to place religion above philosophy. In Hegel's philosophy, two forms of alternative consciousness are aesthetic experience, or the experience of art and beauty, and religious experience. These two are equally valid ways of knowing, but neither provides a clear vision of truth, which Hegel calls the Absolute Mind. The Absolute Mind, a perfectly rational mind, is the final resolution or synthesis of all theses and anti-theses. In Hegelian philosophy, the Absolute Mind is the mind of God, although God is not a being separate from humans.

The Absolute Mind may appear hazy in human consciousness. Religion is a better medium for channeling the Absolute Mind than is aesthetics, says Hegel, and Christianity comes closest to approximating the Absolute Mind. In Hegel's view, philosophy is the highest manifestation of the Absolute Mind, and only through philosophy can art or religion reach their full expression.

Kierkegaard uses Hegel's ideas to create his own stages of human consciousness—the aesthetic, the ethical, and the religious. In the aesthetic stage people are primarily concerned with the erotic and with art. The aesthetic life is dedicated to "immediacy," a word borrowed from Hegel, who uses it to mean unreflective (unselfconscious) knowledge. Those who live in Kierkegaard's aesthetic sphere primarily cultivate sensual experience, and the criteria for living a good life are not defined by right or wrong. The next stage or sphere in Kierkegaard's hierarchy is the ethical, the stage of existence in which a person follows the rules of society and develops a moral compass. This stage is similar to Hegel's concept of _sittlichkeit_, or behavior that contributes to a social group's shared set of ethical norms. Last and highest for Kierkegaard is the religious sphere, in which a person takes a leap of faith that transcends commonplace ethics. This leap requires a passionate belief in something that a person cannot necessarily show or prove to others.

Both Kierkegaard and Hegel use the terminology of the "particular" to refer to what applies to one individual, while the "universal" applies to the ethical sphere, or current social norms. Moreover, Kierkegaard doesn't disagree with Hegel about the importance of the universal—but Kierkegaard insists that the individual as a "particular" steps outside of the universal when the individual makes the leap of faith. He calls such individuals "knights of faith." When a knight of faith such as Abraham enters the religious realm, he is no longer bound by Hegel's universal.

Thus, Kierkegaard uses Hegel's notions of levels of human consciousness but differs from Hegel in asserting that religious consciousness is superior to ethical consciousness, or to a rational, philosophical perspective.

Kierkegaard also appropriates Hegel's concept of telos, or ultimate purpose. In [Problema 1](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Fear-and-Trembling/problema-1-summary/), the first of the three problems he poses in _Fear and Trembling_, he says that there is a "teleological suspension of the ethical" when a person takes a leap of faith. That is, faith trumps ethics when an individual as a particular enters into a relationship with the absolute. Thus, Kierkegaard both uses Hegel's philosophy and interrogates it, showing where it falls short as a system for understanding faith.

## Kierkegaard and Regine Olsen

Some critics read aspects of Kierkegaard's biography into _Fear and Trembling_, particularly his aborted relationship with Regine Olson. Kierkegaard first met Regine when she was 14 or 15 and became engaged to her when she was 17 or 18. But then he broke the engagement the following year in 1841. Scholars can only speculate on why Kierkegaard dissolved a relationship with a woman he seemed to love. At one point he said an engagement was as binding as a marriage, and he left Regine all his possessions when he died even though she had been married to someone else for years. On his deathbed Kierkegaard expressed regret about never marrying, and he said in his journals that if he had had faith for this life, he would have stayed with Regine. On her part, she deliberately sought out Kierkegaard in 1855 to say a brief goodbye to him before leaving for the West Indies. This was also the year of his death.

There is more than enough evidence in the text to show that in _Fear and Trembling_, Kierkegaard is puzzling out what happened between himself and Regine. Kierkegaard broke with Regine around the same time he decided to devote himself to defending true Christianity. Since themes of faith and sacrifice run through the Abraham story that Kierkegaard examines in the text, the reader can draw parallels between the story of Abraham and Kierkegaard's life. Translator and Kierkegaard scholar Alastair Hannay holds that the philosopher was sacrificing Regine, who wanted to marry him, or perhaps he was sacrificing himself, since he wanted to marry Regine. Or perhaps he was a victim of his father's dysfunction—specifically, of his father's religious and existential guilt—which made Kierkegaard feel as if he could not accept the ordinary pleasures of family life and must instead carry out a higher mission.

Another critic sees a parallel between the story of Kierkegaard and Regine and another tale Kierkegaard discusses in the text, that of the merman and Agnete. In this story a merman, a serial seducer with human consciousness, is laid low by the perfect trust and faith of the woman who loves him. He cannot seduce her as a result and can only leave her or marry her. Religious philosopher Ronald Green notes that Kierkegaard's tormented struggle with sin and his doubts about marrying Regine are evident in his retelling of the folktale. The merman story may be Kierkegaard's way of understanding why he gave up the idea of marriage. An overwhelming sense of doom about his family heritage haunted Kierkegaard's life, with all of his siblings, as well as his mother, dying before he was 21. Both he and his father suffered from depression, and Kierkegaard's father believed he was cursed. As Green points out, two of three stories in [Problema 3](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Fear-and-Trembling/problema-3-summary/) are about people who are unable to marry because of a family curse or a foreboding about what will happen.

|God|The God of Kierkegaard's treatise is the Old Testament God of Abraham who tests Abraham's faith. God is also synonymous with the absolute, which is both a divinity as well as a representation of any duty an individual has that is not understood or sanctioned by the universal (society). [Read More](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Fear-and-Trembling/key-figure-analysis/#God)|
|Abraham|Abraham (flourished early 2nd millennium BCE) was the first patriarch of the Hebrew nation. He is also known by Christians as the father of faith because of his willingness to sacrifice his son Isaac on God's command. [Read More](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Fear-and-Trembling/key-figure-analysis/#Abraham)|
|Agamemnon|Agamemnon is a tragic hero who must sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia to a goddess to get a fair wind that will take the Greek fleet to Troy. Killing his daughter is a duty within the realm of the universal, and his terrible deed is thus understood and forgiven, unlike Abraham's duty, which is personal and must remain secret.|

# Summary

## Summary

### Epigraph and Preface

The narrator is referenced in the [Epigraph](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Fear-and-Trembling/epigraph-summary/) as someone who does not have full access to the meaning of the text. The narrator introduces himself in the [Preface](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Fear-and-Trembling/preface-summary/) by signing it as [Johannes](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Fear-and-Trembling/key-figure-analysis/#Johannes) _de silentio_, which roughly means "John the silent." Readers should not consider the narrator to be the same as [Kierkegaard](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Fear-and-Trembling/author/). The tone of the preface is quite sarcastic, and Johannes reveals he is disgusted with the armchair philosophers of his day who speak as if they already have faith, as if faith were something easy to come by. He is annoyed by their desire to go beyond faith, when in former, more serious days, faith was a task enough for a lifetime.

### Attunement

The central story Johannes will discuss is the biblical tale generally called "The Binding of Isaac," in which [God](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Fear-and-Trembling/key-figure-analysis/#God) tests [Abraham](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Fear-and-Trembling/key-figure-analysis/#Abraham), the father of the Hebrew nation, by asking him to sacrifice his son Isaac, who was born when Abraham was 100 years old after a long struggle with infertility, as a burnt offering. Johannes posits a hypothetical reader who has been fascinated by this story since childhood. He then presents four alternative scenarios, filling in the bare bones of the story and thereby altering its meaning, in the hopes of better understanding Abraham. His efforts simply prove to himself, however, that he cannot understand Abraham.

### Speech in Praise of Abraham

The poet is a culture's spirit of remembrance for its heroes. The hero is great, but so is everyone—in proportion to what they love, and the one who loves God is the greatest of all. Abraham was such a person, and his strength came from his powerlessness before God. Abraham was great because he continued to believe that God would allow him to keep his son even though he also believed that he would have to sacrifice Isaac. Johannes praises Abraham for not needing to go further than faith in 130 years of life.

### Preamble from the Heart

People read Abraham's story but do not think about it too deeply. They don't think about the anguish he suffered. They don't think about his duty to protect his son. If faith cannot make it holy to murder a son, then Abraham is nothing but a murderer. A contradiction exists between the ethics of murdering a son and the religious expression of sacrificing him. The narrator would have sacrificed his son if God so ordered, Johannes admits, resigning himself to God's will, but he would have fallen into despair. Abraham, however, has accomplished a double movement. He resigns himself to God's will but then makes a leap of faith, knowing that God will not take his son away from him.

### Is There a Teleological Suspension of the Ethical?

An individual is expected to give up their personal telos (purpose, ultimate goal) to the universal telos (that of society; the "common good") in the realm of ethics. According to the Hegelian view, this is the highest a human being can rise. Those who assert their particularity and hold their personal telos above the universal telos in the realm of ethics are either in a state of temptation or sin. But if this is the case, then Abraham is no better than a murderer, and there can be no such thing as faith as acted out by Abraham. Johannes the narrator concludes that in the realm of the universal it is possible to commit what looks like an immoral act if it is disclosed as something necessary for the greater good. But Abraham's act to kill Isaac cannot be explained nor shared with others, and from the point of view of the universal, his act is not justified. Nonetheless, Abraham, as a single individual with qualities and characteristics uniquely Abraham's, rose higher than the universal in his act of proving his faith to God. His act is a paradox that cannot be mediated in the realm of the universal. Therefore, in such cases, a teleological suspension of the ethical takes place as Abraham takes a leap of faith.

### Is There an Absolute Duty to God?

If Hegel is right that everything in a human being can be measured, then Abraham is not the father of faith, and faith does not exist. For Hegel, the exterior, such as the social system or the state, is superior to the interior. For Kierkegaard, the paradox of faith is that it contains an interiority that is incapable of being compared with the exterior. Abraham fulfills an absolute duty to the absolute, which is God. Before faith, there is a "movement of infinity," beyond logic, and faith enters in afterward, unexpectedly. Kierkegaard says faith enters in "on the strength of the absurd"—that is, only after a person releases their individuality to the infinite, or God, can they reach the point where faith emerges, and faith leads them back to true individuality. Thus, Johannes concludes there is an absolute duty to God, and the individual, as a particular, is higher than the universal and thus is in absolute relation to God when they make a leap of faith.

### Was It Ethically Defensible of Abraham to Conceal His Purpose from Sarah, from Eleazar, from Isaac?

Abraham had no choice but to conceal his plans: the universal can be disclosed or shared with others, but once a person rises above the universal and is in relation with the absolute, that person cannot speak and be understood, and therefore they must remain quiet. Had Abraham told his loved ones he planned to kill Isaac, they would have tried to dissuade him by saying he had a choice to disobey. Or they would have called him a hypocrite if he protested that he had to carry out God's orders despite his love for his son. In either case, Abraham would have fallen back into the universal and not have exhibited perfect faith.

### Epilogue

Every generation learns anew what it means to be human and what it means to love. But no generation goes beyond love. The highest passion is faith, and every generation begins and ends in that regard in the same place. Finally, the task of faith is enough for any human lifetime, and no one can go further than faith.

# Epigraph

## Key Takeaways

- The epigraph is a quote by J.G. Hamann: "What Tarquin the Proud said in his garden with the poppy blooms was understood by the son but not by the messenger."
- This quote references an instance in which Tarquin, an early Roman king, was fighting a war and had his son flee to the enemy country, pretending to be a traitor running from an abusive father.
- The enemy had made Tarquin's son a leader. When the son sent a messenger to his father, the father answered him in code, so that the messenger would not understand.
- By striking off the heads of the tallest poppies in his garden (this action was performed by Tarquin), Tarquin's son understood that his father wanted him to kill or banish all the leading men of the enemy country.
- Readers of _Fear and Trembling_ should understand this story to be a message to them: they should pay attention to the true message of the text, which is not known to the narrator Johannes _de silentio_.
- The message from Kierkegaard is that Johannes's treatise is in the realm of the first sphere of existence, as conceptualized by the philosopher. The text is in the sphere of aesthetics. It is a thing of beauty perhaps, which can be immediately enjoyed but nothing more.
- The reader must use the text to enter the third sphere of existence as conceptualized by Kierkegaard: the sphere of the religious. In that sphere the reader can take a leap of faith. In that realm the reader can act.

# Preface

## Key Takeaways

- The preface states that the narrator and "author" of the text is Johannes _de silentio_, a fictional character who should not be construed as the real author, Søren Kierkegaard. In fact, Johannes may hold his own opinions on the subject matter.
- The tone of the preface is quite sarcastic. Johannes uses verbal irony throughout these introductory remarks: for example, he notes that philosophy, like commerce, nowadays is in the business of holding "clearance sales" on ideas.
- Philosophers have easily and with little effort learned how to doubt everything and have even gone beyond doubting.
- René Descartes, the first modern philosopher, also doubted but said, "What God has revealed to us is incomparably more certain than anything else." Descartes said human beings should submit to God, whose authority he ranked higher than human judgment and reason.
- Johannes says, "Descartes was a quiet and lonely thinker, not a bellowing street watch." He studied long and hard enough to enter the ranks of the learned and _only then_ changed his opinion, thinking his method was full of errors and that his self-instruction had led to "the increasing discovery" of his own ignorance.
- Likewise, the Greek philosophers labored for a lifetime, "keeping the balance of doubt in the face of all inveiglements, fearlessly rejecting the certainties of sense and thought." Nonetheless, nowadays the journeyman philosopher begins with doubt.
- Nowadays nobody stops at faith; they want to go further, although "it would perhaps be rash to inquire where to." Johannes is too polite not to assume that everyone nowadays has faith; otherwise, there would be no reason to go beyond faith.
- In the old days, however, faith was a task of a lifetime not a skill acquired in weeks. For such people, even at the end of their lives they retained enough faith "not to have forgotten the fear and trembling" of their youth. No one outgrows such faith, unless they go further, as today's philosophers claim to do.
- Johannes claims not to be a philosopher. He does not understand "the System" (a concept of prominent German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel) or whether the system has been completed. Moreover, in his view, even if faith could be rendered completely in a conceptual form, that would not mean the philosopher had grasped faith, or could tell how a person came to faith.
- Nowadays "passion has been done away with for the sake of science," and any author who wishes to be successful must write something that can be leafed through and understood out of sequence by the casual reader. Johannes fears his writing will be either ignored or sliced and diced to be digested in easy sound bites. He protests that his writing is not a system, and it does not easily lend itself to any "systematic bag-searcher." Thus, he implies that the reader must pay careful attention to the text in its entirety.
- The preface introduces some of the targets of _Fear and Trembling_. Johannes is making fun of modern philosophy and modern European culture. Everyone in the modern world seems to doubt everything, and all claim to possess genuine religious faith. In comparing the Europeans unfavorably to the Greeks, Johannes notes that the Greeks took a lifetime to become proficient in doubt, while Europeans _begin_ their philosophical and religious speculation with doubt.
- Similarly, in days past faith was a lifelong endeavor, which modern people arrive at too easily and then insist they must go further. Johannes is referring here to contemporary Danish theologians who borrowed heavily from Hegel, the most widely read and most influential of the German idealists.
- Hegel gave faith a place of importance in his philosophy, but he believed that religion at its best (Christianity, he claimed) is still a flawed medium for channeling the Absolute Mind. For Hegel, the highest manifestation of the Absolute Mind is philosophy.
- Through the persona of Johannes, Kierkegaard pokes fun at the notion of going further than faith. Johannes satirically echoes H.L. Martensen, a theologian and right-leaning Hegelian whose philosophy Kierkegaard opposed. Martensen claimed a thinking person should move beyond the methodological doubt of Descartes—who came by his doubt honestly, in Johannes's view—to Hegel and beyond.
- Hegel famously constructed a system through which the principle of the dialectic (the union of opposites) moved everything forward toward the telos (goal or purpose) of the Absolute Mind. Hegel believed religion was a stopping place on the way to philosophy, an idea that Kierkegaard vigorously opposes, and the limits of which he exposes in _Fear and Trembling_. At the end of the text, nothing is resolved and no absolute is revealed.
- Hegel's ideas were first introduced to Danish intellectuals by J.L. Heiberg, a poet and playwright. Martensen and others applied Hegel's ideas to theology. In his writings Kierkegaard criticized the ideas of both of these Danish Hegelians. Martensen believed that individual subjectivity should ultimately be replaced by the "objective reason" of the church and state, an idea that Kierkegaard openly and vehemently opposed toward the end of his career. But the premise of _Fear and Trembling_—that an individual religious conscience can in particular instances hold more moral authority than established social ethics—is already a polemic, or attack, on Martensen's insistence on the supremacy of the church and state.
- Hegel's philosophy is a comprehensive system of dialectics in which opposites (thesis and antithesis) are resolved into a synthesis. Hegel goes beyond Aristotle (384–22 BCE), the Greek philosopher who first talked about the dialectic, however. Hegel claims that each new synthesis is not a resolution nor final truth, but just one synthesis in a long, continuous process of syntheses, until a proposition is resolved in the ultimate synthesis, or the Absolute Idea. Thus, when Johannes protests "the System," he is making fun of both Hegel and the Hegelians.

# Attunement

## Key Takeaways

- The central story Johannes will deconstruct for the purpose of delving into faith, doubt, and resignation is the biblical tale generally referred to as "The Binding of Isaac," from Genesis 22 of the Hebrew Bible.
- It was common for the Israelites to use animals as burnt offerings, first killing the animal and then lighting a fire that would consume this offering for God. In the Genesis story God tells Abraham to sacrifice his son, who was born when Abraham was 100 years old, as a burnt offering, and Abraham complies. But God stays his hand at the last moment. Because Abraham shows he is a "God-fearing man" who will not withhold his son, God promises he will have innumerable descendants.
- Johannes would have expected his audience to be well versed in this story, although he himself tells and retells the tale as _Fear and Trembling_ unfolds.
- At the outset of "Attunement" Johannes presents a hypothetical man who learned as a child "that beautiful tale of how God tried Abraham." When the boy grows to be a man, the story continues to haunt him. He pictures various tableaus in the life of Abraham, but he has only one longing: to accompany Abraham and his son on that momentous journey and to see, hear, and experience what Abraham saw, heard, and experienced. He cannot, so he pictures a variety of scenarios in which he fills in the blanks in the story.
- First the man pictures Abraham riding with his son in silence for three days, leaving the servants behind when they reached their destination, and going up to the mountain with Isaac on the fourth day. He imagines Abraham gentle and encouraging while Isaac pleads for his life. When Isaac continues to not understand, Abraham pretends to be an idolater—telling Isaac that the sacrifice is his idea, not God's. Abraham does not wish Isaac to lose his faith in God, which is why he lies.
- Johannes likens Abraham's lie to how women blacken their breasts while they are weaning a child so the child will not recognize the mother's breast.
- Next, the man imagines Abraham after the moment when God stays his hand. In the days and years that follow, Abraham cannot forget what God has demanded, and so he loses his joy.
- Next, the man imagines Abraham returning to Mount Moriah alone, after God tests him. Abraham begs God's forgiveness for having been willing to sacrifice his son. He feels guilty because it is his duty to protect his son. Moreover, he loves Isaac immensely, so how could he be forgiven for this sin—his willingness to kill his beloved son?
- Next, the man imagines that Isaac sees his father's hand clenched in anguish when he draws the knife. They return home, but Isaac has lost his faith because of his father's doubt.
- No one was as great as Abraham, the man thinks, after each imagining. He wonders if anyone can understand him.
- It may be easy to assume, based on the title of this chapter, that Johannes wants to help readers understand Abraham, by "attuning" them to his thought or feeling processes; in fact, he does the opposite, presenting four possible scenarios, none of which match the Abraham in the bare-bones of the story. Moreover, all Johannes's "fill in the blanks" seem antithetical to the meaning of Abraham as the so-called father of faith. Johannes's main purpose is to point out what Abraham _is not_ and to underscore the idea that others cannot possibly understand him.

# Speech in Praise of Abraham

Share

## Key Takeaways

- If man has no eternal consciousness, what then? Johannes asks, "If an unfathomable, insatiable emptiness lay hid beneath everything, what then would life be but despair?"
- Humans need not despair, for they have a sacred bond uniting them with others. People are not like the leaves of the forest. God created man and woman as well as the hero and the poet.
- The poet is "the spirit of remembrance" who can admire what the hero has done. Because of the poet, no one who is great will be forgotten.
- But everyone is great in their own way, in proportion to what they loved, and the one who loves God is the greatest of all.
- "He who strove with God became greater than all," conquering God with his powerlessness. The one who relied on himself and gained all is great but not as great as the one who believed God. Abraham's strength came from his powerlessness before God. His wisdom was based in folly, while his hope appeared as insanity.
- Abraham's faith drew him from his homeland and into the promised land: it was the reason he accepted the promise that his seed would flourish in all nations on earth.
- Abraham was never sorrowful nor worried that Sarah will be unable to bear a child. According to the Bible, Sarah is 90 years old when she finally gives birth to Isaac, and Abraham is 100. While Sarah doubted God's word, Abraham never did.
- Johannes notes, "It is great to give up one's desire, but greater to stick to it after having given it up." Abraham is "the father of faith" because he continues to hope and believe he will be given a son, and God fulfills his promise.
- But God "tempted" Abraham again when he ordered him to sacrifice his son. It appeared as if "the glorious memory of the human race, the promise in Abraham's seed ... was only a whim." As the reader will learn further on, Johannes uses the word "tempt" because Abraham is tempted to do what is ethical—to not kill his son.
- Abraham's faith is absurd, and if he had lacked faith, he might have done something great—for example, killing himself in Isaac's place. Thus he would have been admired by the world and never forgotten. But it is one thing to be a hero and another to be a "guiding star that saves the anguished."
- Abraham says nothing to Sarah or his servant Eliezer about God's call, since his test "by its very nature exacted an oath of silence." Abraham neither felt anguish nor called to heaven with his prayers, knowing "no sacrifice was too hard when God demanded it." Had he doubted God for a moment, he would have borne witness neither to his faith nor to God's mercy.
- As a result of his faith, Abraham was able to keep Isaac. Johannes calls Abraham second father to the human race, a man who struggled with God and experienced "supreme passion, the sacred, pure, and humble expression of divine madness which the pagans admired." Johannes praises Abraham for getting no further than faith in 130 years of life.

# Preamble from the Heart : Problemata 

## Key Takeaways

- In the mundane world events happen randomly, and life seems at times unfair and arbitrary. In the world of the spirit, however, divine order prevails in which the righteous and the faithful are rewarded.
- Conventional wisdom dictates that knowledge of larger truths is all that is necessary, but the narrator disagrees. For example, "countless generations" knew Abraham's story, but it did not make them "sleepless." Thus, according to the narrator, most people do not grasp the depth of meaning in the story.
- The reader of the story tends to bypass Abraham's anguish: he had a sacred duty to protect his son, and yet he agreed to kill him. People praise Abraham as a great man, but should they follow his example?
- For his part, Johannes has no intention of mindlessly praising Abraham. If faith cannot make it holy to murder one's son, then Abraham is no better than a murderer.
- There is a contradiction in the ethics of murdering one's son and the religious expression of sacrificing him; this contradiction should cause insomnia in anyone seriously contemplating the story.
- "Can one speak unreservedly of Abraham, then, without risking that someone will go off the rails and do likewise?" the narrator asks. Johannes determines that he can speak about faith in its entirety without inciting murder, since the wholeness of faith would not make a person a murderer but, rather, like Abraham.
- At the same time, the narrator will not pretend to have Abraham's faith, and therefore he will not presume to ride on his coattails, as some might be tempted to do.
- Some claim that philosophy, such as that of Hegel, is difficult to understand, while faith as illustrated in the life of Abraham is easy to understand. "To go beyond Hegel, that is a miracle," the narrator sarcastically says, "but to go beyond Abraham is simplest of all." Johannes has, after careful study, understood much of Hegel's philosophy, but when he thinks about Abraham, he is "virtually annihilated," as he contemplates the "monstrous paradox that is the content of Abraham's life."
- Kierkegaard, through the narrator, is criticizing Hegelians who breezily assert that one must go beyond faith to a higher understanding of the absolute. In Hegel's philosophy, religion (and by extension faith) ranks lower than philosophy, which is closer to the Absolute Idea. The Danish Hegelians say that individual subjectivity is best subsumed in the objectivity of church and state. So here, too, an individual expression of faith must be rejected out of hand, since it is outside the realm of society's ethics and/or religious values. Johannes does not reject Abraham's faith, but he also admits that he doesn't understand the monstrous paradox that Abraham had to contend with in loving both God and Isaac.
- The narrator does not think faith is better or worse than philosophy, but he objects when philosophers attempt to explain away faith, as if it were nothing.
- Johannes has faced down dread, but his courage is not faith and cannot be compared with faith. He cannot hurl himself into the absurdity of faith, but he doesn't pride himself on that account.
- For the narrator, God is love, and this thought makes him "unspeakably happy." Still, he has not the courage of faith.
- God's love is for him "incommensurable" with the whole of reality. To feel faith, however, would be something "far higher" and would inspire a higher form of happiness. Johannes does not trouble God with his everyday problems—unlike the faithful, who are convinced God concerns himself with the smallest details of their lives.
- Kierkegaard uses the terms _incommensurable_ and _incommensurability_ frequently in the text, and he doesn't always mean the same thing. First, incommensurability refers to the impossibility of applying a common measure to two things: they can be compared, but they cannot be measured. However, in some contexts Kierkegaard does use the word to mean two things that are not strictly comparable. In this context Johannes means that his concept of God and his concept of the reality created by God cannot be measured against one another—or, more simply, that one cannot be understood in terms of the other.
- The narrator can't help but wonder whether his contemporaries exaggerate in saying they are "capable of making the movement of faith," meaning they identify themselves with Abraham. Johannes imagines himself in Abraham's place and asserts that he would have taken the journey to Mount Moriah, the place of sacrifice, but he would have done so in despair and resignation, believing everything was lost to him.
- Some might think his resignation "more idealistic and poetic than Abraham's narrow-mindedness," but in fact, resignation would be a poor substitute for faith. Additionally, the narrator's love for Isaac would have been less than Abraham's, since he would go through with Isaac's murder on the strength of his resignation and not on the strength of faith.
- Further, he'd have a hard time rejoicing in his son when he had been given back by God. "What Abraham found the easiest of all would for me be hard," for after having made that "infinite movement" of resignation, he could only keep Isaac with pain. Johannes means that once he had fallen into despair, he could not have returned to the same type of relationship with God, pre-sacrifice, since his faith would not have been perfect faith, and he would have lost his faith as a result of his despair.
- On the other hand, Abraham was not resigned and believed God would not demand Isaac of him, even as he was willing to offer him as he had been commanded. Abraham is comfortable in the realm of the absurd, in which God both demands and withdraws his demand. Abraham is surprised by the outcome, nevertheless. By means of a "double movement," he returns to his original position and receives his son back with joy.
- Abraham's faith is such that he would find happiness in this world, not in the hereafter.
- The dialectic of faith is remarkable, and the narrator can only form a conception of its elevation and no more. While the narrator can make the journey into "infinitude" (resigning himself to God's will), he cannot, like Abraham, then return to finitude and the joy of this life. Johannes sums up his point by saying, "He who loves God without faith reflects on himself, while the person who loves God in faith reflects on God." Thus, Abraham moves beyond infinite resignation to faith.
- Anyone who believes they can be moved to faith simply by reflecting on Abraham's story is deceiving themselves. Moreover, modern people cannot even stop at faith but must go further—"to worldly wisdom, petty calculation," or other things that call man's divine origin into question.
- Rather, it would be better to stand on faith and not fall. "The movement of faith must be made continually on the strength of the absurd," and in this movement finitude must not be lost.
- "The knights of infinite resignation are readily recognizable," although those who "wear the jewel of faith" may look ordinary—sometimes like a "_bourgeois_ philistine"—or they may be hard to spot.
- Kierkegaard makes a distinction between two types of heroes: the knight of infinite resignation (sometimes call the knight of infinity) and the knight of faith. An additional third category of people are the "slaves of misery," who live purely in the material realm and never strive for anything beyond what is easily obtainable. These three types also roughly correspond to Kierkegaard's spheres or stages of existence: the aesthetic, the ethical, and the religious.
- The knight of resignation never gives up the love of his ideal, although he resigns himself to the fact that he will not obtain it. He will channel his love into a higher ideal and thus obtain peace. The knight of faith, however, goes beyond resignation, never giving up on his belief that he will obtain his ideal in this life.
- The knight of faith delights in the things of the world yet is always "making the movements of infinity." Such people empty the sorrow of existence in "infinite resignation" yet experience the "bliss of infinity." They have felt the pain of renouncing the world but at the same time feel happy and secure in finitude. They resign everything and then take it back "on the strength of the absurd."
- Ordinary people are disheartened by sorrow and joy and in some sense withdraw from life. The knights of infinity (or infinite resignation) fly upward and then fall, hesitating before attempting again to fly. The knights of faith, however, never hesitate after they fall. They immediately begin again.
- To illustrate the difference between the knight of infinite resignation and the knight of faith, Johannes provides a hypothetical scenario in which a young man falls in love with an unobtainable princess.
- The knight of infinite resignation will risk everything on one single wish or desire. If the knight fails, he will not forget what he wished for and attempt to become someone or something else. He is not like the butterfly who has forgotten it was once a caterpillar. Although pain accompanies memory, the knight who is infinitely resigned reconciles himself to existence.
- In Johannes's scenario the immediate object—the princess—is unobtainable. But in the spiritual realm the impossible becomes possible as a spiritual love that transcends the particularity of the princess. The knight's longing becomes entirely inward, and his love for the princess takes on a religious character, becoming "love for the eternal being." He is thus "reconciled ... in the eternal consciousness of his love's validity ... that no reality can take from him."
- This knight "grasped ... that even in loving another [person,] one should be sufficient unto oneself."
- Infinite resignation brings peace, and the pain of resignation can be a consolation. "Infinite resignation is the last stage before faith," since only then does a person's "eternal validity" become apparent to them, and only then can they grasp "existence on the strength of faith." What Johannes means is that faith is only possible after a person has first reached the state of infinite resignation.
- Similarly, the knight of faith "renounces the claim to the love which is the content of his life" but then commits to believing he will get what he desires (in this case the love of the princess) because all things are possible with God.
- The knight grasps the absurd through faith, admitting the impossibility while believing in the absurd.
- Faith is therefore higher than an aesthetic emotion—not "the immediate inclination of the heart but the paradox of existence."
- The movement toward resignation requires "strength and energy and freedom of spirit." But the next step, the movement toward faith—to believe one will get what one desires, is "a marvel."
- Resignation is a philosophical movement, in which one wins "eternal consciousness." The knight of resignation serves as his own censor by renouncing life for the love of "eternal being." Through faith, however, a person receives everything back.
- It takes courage to renounce temporality for eternity, but it takes a special "humble courage" to grasp "the whole of temporality on the strength of the absurd." Such is the nature of faith.
- The knight can use his own strength to give up the princess but not to get her back. He can get her back only "on the strength of the absurd."
- Johannes continues to express skepticism toward those of his generation who claim to have gone beyond faith. In his view, anyone can "perform the infinite movement of resignation," although to do so takes a great act of courage. Faith, however, is another matter, and no one should suppose that faith is "something inferior or that it is an easy matter": it is the most difficult.
- Toward the end of this section, the narrator returns to Abraham and how people focus on God's mercy rather than on Abraham's faith, even though they praise Abraham. Rather, it would be better to forget about Abraham if the hearer of the story cannot "learn how to be horrified at the monstrous paradox which is the significance of his life."
- Modern people ought not to make Abraham insignificant by blinding themselves to the suffering of his trial. The narrator objects to the marketing of "a cut-price version of Abraham" by those who would, at the same time, warn others not to follow in his footsteps by doing what he did.
- Johannes notes that the next sections will discuss how a paradox can turn a murder into a holy act that is pleasing to God. Such a thing cannot be grasped by the mind, since "faith begins precisely where thinking leaves off."

#  Problema 1 : Problemata (Is There a Teleological Suspension of the Ethical?) 

## Key Takeaways

- What is ethical is universal—it applies to everyone—and ethics has no telos (end purpose) outside of itself. An individual, however, is a particular, and each person has their own telos. Still, an individual must express their telos within the universal and in the realm of ethics must give up their individuality to universality.
- To willfully express one's particularity against the universal is, by definition, to sin. Temptation is the urge to assert one's particularity with regard to ethics. This state of temptation (and any actions that may result from it) can be transcended only by surrendering to the universal in an act of repentance and reconciliation.
- If surrendering to the universal is the highest act that a human being can perform, then a person's "eternal blessedness" or salvation hinges on their subsuming their personal telos in the universal. Then Hegel is right in saying a human being is a "moral form of evil," which can be "annulled in the teleology of the ethical life." The person who does not embrace this teleology is either in the state of sin or temptation. But if this is the case, then Hegel is wrong in not condemning Abraham as a murderer.
- Abraham's case expresses the paradox of faith, in that the single individual becomes higher than the universal. The individual starts in the universal but then sets himself apart as a particular above the universal.
- If the ethical is the highest and nothing "incommensurable" remains in a human being except the evil identified by Hegel (i.e. a person's individuality apart from the universal), then philosophers should not go beyond the categories created by the Greek philosophers.
- Faith is a paradox that allows an individual to transcend the universal. If this were not the case, then Abraham is "done for" and "faith has never existed in the world just because it has always existed." This last sentence is repeated in one form or another many times in the text, and it is difficult to understand exactly what Kierkegaard means by it. The first part is easy enough to understand: if faith does not allow a person to step outside conventional ethics, then Abraham is "done for" or damned because he becomes nothing less than a murderer.
- The second part of the sentence, according to Kierkegaard scholar C. Stephen Evans, is the philosopher's way of saying that what passes for faith in the ordinary world is not true faith, and faith such as Abraham's cannot exist within the Hegelian paradigm if that paradigm is correct.
- According to Evans, faith is "a rare and admirable quality for which Abraham serves as a notable exemplar." When Johannes says faith does not exist because it always existed, he means faith has been "identified with the commonplace quality of conforming to the norms of one's own society." So Kierkegaard means that the exemplary faith of Abraham is not recognized as faith by the ordinary person and cannot be understood through traditional thought.
- The important takeaway here is that real faith remains paradoxical and cannot be explained by the mind and that most people have no real idea of the meaning of faith.
- Those with true faith must be ready to offer criteria for distinguishing this paradox from a temptation to put oneself above the law. Abraham's story is an example of the "teleological suspension of the ethical," and "Abraham represents faith." In acting on the absurd, Abraham becomes higher than the universal. He is no tragic hero; rather, he is "either a murderer or a man of faith."
- A tragic hero is understandable; Abraham is not. Johannes briefly alludes to the Greek tragedy in which Agamemnon sacrifices his daughter Iphigenia to raise a wind that will take his ships to Troy. This sacrifice is demanded by an offended god, and the king must put the needs of his nation—to fight a war—above his personal feelings about his daughter.
- Johannes also mentions a biblical story in which Jephthah asks God for victory in battle in exchange for the sacrifice of the first living creature he sees coming out of his house when he returns home. The first thing he sees is his daughter.
- In both cases Johannes deems the sacrifices ethical, since they are within the universal, ethical bounds of the cultures of Agamemnon and Jephthah.
- On the other hand, Abraham oversteps the ethical. He is not saving a nation nor appeasing an angry god. His action is an entirely private undertaking, "an act of purely personal virtue." He will sacrifice Isaac to please God because God demands the proof of his faith. For Abraham, the temptation is not a deed that falls outside the universal; rather, it is the ethical or universal itself, "which would keep him from doing God's will."
- Since Abraham cannot be mediated by the universal (the ethical telos), he cannot speak. The hero sacrifices himself and "gives up the finite [in exchange for] the infinite ... and the eye of the beholder rests confidently upon him." But the one who gives up the universal for something even higher cannot be understood by the beholder.
- What the narrator means is that heroes sacrifice themselves for some greater purpose, which is clearly seen and recognized by society. On the other hand, when the knight of faith steps outside the universal, their actions are not understood by society, and the knight cannot explain or justify those actions.
- "When the ethical is ... teleologically suspended," the individual exists "in opposition to the universal." Abraham's faith is a paradox that puts him "in an absolute relation to the absolute." The justification of his actions lies not in the universal but in the particular. But the question still remains: how can a single individual know that they are justified?
- Is Abraham justified because he got Isaac back? Had he actually sacrificed Isaac, would he have been less justified? Johannes notes that people are concerned with the outcome or conclusion of the story and want nothing of the "fear, the distress, the paradox." People become great not because of what happens to them but because of what they do.
- Johannes digresses with another example of a knight of faith: the Virgin Mary. Christians call her great and blessed among women. Mary gave birth miraculously to the son of God, but she too suffered dread, distress, and paradox. The angel visited Mary only and did not explain the situation to her family and friends.
- Mary is mortified, from the perspective of her society, by the pregnancy she cannot explain. The narrator notes, "Isn't it true here too that those whom God blesses he damns in the same breath?"
- When Mary says, "Behold the handmaid of the Lord," she is great, and it becomes clear why she was chosen to be the mother of God. She needs no external admiration, any more than "Abraham needs our tears." Neither Mary nor Abraham was a hero, but both became greater than heroes because of the agony they suffered and the paradox they endured.
- Returning to Abraham, Johannes says that "in the time before the outcome [of the binding of Isaac,] either Abraham was a murderer every minute," or he is part of a paradox. Abraham cannot be mediated (meaning justified, explained, or understood) by virtue of the universal. Thus "Abraham's story contains a teleological suspension of the ethical."
- The purpose (telos) of ethics is to merge with the universal (society), in Hegel's view. But knights of faith have a higher purpose, in Kierkegaard's view. Abraham is such a one, and he is justified by faith in bypassing what is ethical.
- As a single individual, as a particularity, Abraham rose higher than the universal. This is the paradox that cannot be mediated.
- A tragic hero can fulfill his destiny through his own strength. Nonetheless, many can advise him as he walks his difficult path. The knight of faith, however, walks a narrow path with no advisors and no one to understand him. Yet "faith is a marvel," accessible to all because all life is united in passion, and "faith is a passion."

# Problema 2 : Problemata (Is There an Absolute Duty to God?) 

## Key Takeaways

- Duty is duty to God only when it is referred to God, yet one does not come into relation with God by performing one's duty.
- "It is a duty to love God" is a tautology (a circular statement or argument), since God in the abstract is the divine, the universal, or duty itself. Human existence in this paradigm is "self-enclosed," and "the ethical is at once the limit and completion." An abstract notion of God becomes a vanishing point, and his power can be seen only in the ethical.
- If it is not possible to love God more directly—if it is true that "nothing [is] incommensurable [here Kierkegaard means unmeasurable or incalculable] in a human life," then Hegel is right. The Hegelian viewpoint allows nothing higher than ethics as a universal that applies at all times and in all places. According to Hegel, one can have a relationship with God only through the ethical. If this is the case, God disappears into the ethical, which becomes divinized and even synonymous with God.
- But if Hegel is right that there is nothing beyond the measurable man, then he is wrong in calling Abraham the father of faith, says Johannes, for in doing so "he has passed sentence on both Abraham and on faith."
- In point of fact, Hegel never calls Abraham the father of faith. On the contrary, he speaks about Abraham in unflattering terms. Moreover, Hegel sees Judaism as a steppingstone to Christianity, which he views as a higher form of religion. But when Kierkegaard, through the narrator, says Hegel is wrong, he means Christian theologians of his day who ascribe to Hegelian philosophy contradict themselves in saying that Abraham is the father of faith.
- In Hegel's philosophy the outer (the social system, the state) is higher than the inner. But in faith interiority is higher than exteriority. The paradox of faith is that it contains an interiority that is incapable of being compared with the exterior.
- Before faith there is "a movement of infinity," and faith enters in after, unexpectedly, "on the strength of the absurd." Only after a person empties themselves in the infinite can they reach the point where faith emerges.
- The single individual paradoxically rises higher than the universal, determining "his relation to the universal through his relation to the absolute," and not vice versa. When the individual has an absolute duty to love God, the ethical becomes relative. While the individual cannot simply put the ethical by the wayside, the love of God can paradoxically cause a person to express their love as its opposite from an ethical point of view. Were this not true, then faith would have no place in existence, and Abraham would be "done for." This last sentence underscores the narrator's belief that faith does have a place, and Abraham is a knight of faith.
- Abraham finds himself in a paradox. As a father he must love his son, but this ethical relationship becomes relative next to the absolute duty to love God. Abraham is faced with a trial and a temptation, both for God's sake and his own. The paradox of faith loses "the intermediate term, i.e. the universal." Abraham's deed appears to be extremely egotistical, but on the other hand it shows his absolute devotion to God.
- Johannes references a passage from the Gospel of Luke on the absolute duty to God. It says that if a person doesn't hate their dear ones and even their own life, that person lacks what is necessary to become Jesus's disciple. The saying is hard to hear. The words are terrible, but the narrator believes they can be understood, even if hearers do not have the courage to obey them. But someone who cannot live by those words should not pass off their lack of courage as humility. In fact, "the courage of faith is the only humble courage."
- God demands absolute love. While any human being demanding absolute fealty is considered egotistical or stupid, a deity making the same demand is regarded in a different light. While the absolute duty to God can lead a person to doing what ethics forbids, this duty does not make the knight of faith stop loving whom he loves, even if he has to kill that person for God's sake.
- "When God asks for Isaac," Kierkegaard says, "Abraham must if possible love him even more, and only then can he sacrifice him." The paradoxical opposite of Abraham's extreme love for both Isaac and God is what makes his act a sacrifice. But in the realm of humanity Abraham cannot make himself understood. In the realm of the universal, "he is and remains a murderer."
- A text like Luke's is seldom recited for fear of "letting people loose"; something terrible may happen when an individual acts as an individual. While most people think that living as an individual is easy, Johannes thinks the opposite. Moreover, anyone "who has learned that to exist as the individual is the most terrifying thing of all" will also say it is the greatest.
- Someone who "lives under [their] own supervision" while respecting themselves and their immortal soul lives in austerity and seclusion. While some might become unbridled beasts if given free rein, the one who "knows how to speak with fear and trembling" is not among them.
- The tragic hero expresses the universal by renouncing his ego, but the knight of faith renounces the universal to be a particular. The knight of faith knows how glorious it is to translate oneself into the universal, as the tragic hero does, making oneself as pristine as possible. Nonetheless, the knight of faith takes the higher path, lonely and solitary and narrow and steep. They accept their solitude and the misunderstanding of others, which is their lot.
- Abraham's first trial is to wait 70 years to have his son Isaac in old age. Then he must sacrifice him. Clearly, the tragic hero has an easier path than the knight of faith. Nonetheless, the knight of faith has achieved glory in becoming God's friend, addressing him as "Thou," while the tragic hero can speak to God only in the third person.
- While a tragic hero like Agamemnon violates an ethical precept, he can fall back on the universal to justify his choice. Agamemnon has a reason, grounded in the universal, for sacrificing his daughter. He must appease a god so he can sail off to war. The knight of faith, however, faces the terror of only having himself to rely on and no way to justify his actions.
- The knight of faith "is a witness, never a teacher, and in this lies [his] deep humanity," worth more than superficial expressions of compassion for others, which at the root is nothing but vanity. Neither does the knight think himself better than others, since he knows that "whatever truly is great is available equally to all."
- Johannes concludes (a) there is an absolute duty to God, and (b) the individual as a particular is higher than the universal and is in absolute relation to God. The alternative is (a) faith "never existed because it has always existed," and (b) "Abraham is done for." Johannes's view is that the first statement is true, not the second.

# Problema 3 : Problemata (Was It Ethically Defensible of Abraham?) 

## Key Takeaways

- The full text for the problem Kierkegaard poses is: "Was it ethically defensible of Abraham to conceal his purpose from Sarah, from Eleazar, from Isaac?"
- The ethical is universal, and the universal is disclosed, meaning that it is shared with others. On the other hand, the immediate psychic being of an individual is concealed. The individual must "unwrap himself from his concealment and become disclosed in the universal." Moreover, deliberately remaining concealed is a state of sin or temptation, from which a person can emerge only by showing themselves.
- The universal always serves as the mediated space, so when an individual in their particularity rises above the universal, they necessarily create a paradox. Hegelians propose that concealment can never be justified, so their view on the necessity of disclosure is consistent with the latter. However, "it isn't quite fair and square" for them to insist in the same breath that Abraham is the father of faith.
- While Hegel himself did not call Abraham the father of faith, Christian philosopher-theologians in Denmark admired Hegel and adapted aspects of his philosophy. In criticizing Hegelians, Kierkegaard is criticizing those theologians. He objects to their materialistic view of Christianity, which equates faith with conformity to the Danish church and state.
- The narrator Johannes is pointing out the contradiction inherent in asserting, on the one hand, that Abraham is the father of faith but, on the other, that he is no better than a murderer from the perspective of a Hegelian. In the Hegelian view anyone who steps outside of the universal is either in temptation or in sin. Therefore, from that perspective Abraham can hardly be the father of faith.
- Faith is not the first immediacy but a later one. Johannes says, "The first immediacy is the aesthetic, and here the Hegelian philosophy may well be right." He continues: If faith is the aesthetic, which he doubts, "then faith has never existed just because it has existed always."
- What Kierkegaard means by _aesthetic_ is not only the apprehension or appreciation of beauty. More generally, the aesthetic is the first of three "spheres" in Kierkegaard's stages of existence. Those who live in the aesthetic sphere primarily cultivate sensual experience, and the criteria for living a good life are not defined by right or wrong.
- The next sphere is the ethical. A person in this stage of existence follows the ethical rules and laws of their society and has developed a strong sense of right and wrong.
- The last sphere, the religious, is the highest, in which a person takes a leap of faith that transcends commonplace ethics. This leap can be in a deity, as is the case of Abraham, but should be understood to mean more generally a passionate belief in something that a person cannot necessarily show or prove to others.
- Johannes is agreeing with Hegel when he says the first immediacy is the aesthetic. As translator and critic Alastair Hannay explains, the aesthetic life is dedicated to immediacy, or unreflective knowledge. The difference is that Hegel includes faith in the aesthetic, while Kierkegaard does not.
- For Hegel two forms of consciousness are the experience of art and beauty (aesthetics) and religious experience. Both are equally valuable, albeit distorted, routes to knowledge. An undistorted vision of reality can be found in the Absolute Mind, which is the rational mind.
- The Absolute Mind is glimpsed in human consciousness opaquely, in aesthetic and sensory experience. Religion is a slightly less opaque experience, with Christianity being the best approximation of the vision of the Absolute Mind.
- Only philosophy can provide an adequate, rational expression of the Absolute Mind. Thus, it is necessary to go further than religion to grasp reality, in Hegel's view. Kierkegaard takes strong exception to this view and makes fun of the Hegelians of his day who wish to go "further," since in his view faith (the religious sphere) is the highest form of consciousness, and striving for it takes up a whole lifetime.
- Johannes repeats several times in _Fear and Trembling_ some version of the assertion that if the Hegelian view is correct—that there is nothing higher than the universal, or ethical, sphere—"then faith has never existed just because it has existed always." This statement is difficult to penetrate. But according to Kierkegaard scholar C. Stephen Evans, what Kierkegaard means is that in his time there is no such thing as the type of faith Abraham had "because faith has been identified with the commonplace quality of conforming to the norms of one's own society."
- Johannes then digresses from his focus on Abraham. Johannes turns to what Abraham is not in an attempt to understand Abraham's paradoxical faith. Johannes gives many examples of literary and mythical figures to shed light on Abraham's concealment, or inability to disclose to those closest to him his purpose in traveling to Mount Moriah.
- Johannes asserts that while aesthetics calls for concealment and rewards it, ethics calls for disclosure and punishes concealment. This dialectic is often seen at work in various literary or mythical tales.
- For example, in a tale such as Euripides's _Iphigenia at Aulis_, the tragic hero Agamemnon, who must sacrifice his daughter for the sake of the state, conceals the demand of the god because "it would be unworthy of the hero to seek another's consolation." Yet the hero's dilemma comes to light when an old servant tells Agamemnon's wife Clytemnestra the reason for her husband's cruel behavior. Thus, Agamemnon's actions are shown to be justified within the ethical parameters of the Greek tragedy.
- The most important story Johannes relates in this section of the text is the tale of _Agnete and the Merman,_ which demonstrates parallels between a demonic hero and a knight of faith such as Abraham.
- The merman is a mythical creature who seduces women. In Johannes's version, Agnete is an innocent who has fallen thoroughly in love with the merman. When he realizes she has absolute faith in him, he is broken, unable to resist the power of her innocence. Thus, he cannot seduce Agnete as he has done the rest of the women. As a result, he takes her home and returns in rage and despair to his own ocean home. The merman is not human, so he cannot take Agnete as a wife.
- Johannes further alters the tale, turning the merman into a creature with human consciousness, so that he has the choice of being saved by Agnete. He has the choice of repenting alone or with Agnete. If he repents alone, he saves her by returning her home, concealing his original evil intentions. His concealment will make both Agnete and himself unhappy, since he bears the guilt of what he has done.
- The merman may choose to "arouse all dark passions" in Agnete, by mocking her and ridiculing her love to stir her pride against him. Johannes maintains, "There dwells infinitely more good in a demonic than a superficial person."
- Thus, by means of the demonic, the merman, like Abraham, aspires to be a particular individual who is higher than the universal. "The demonic has that same property as the divine," and the individual enters into an absolute relationship with the demonic. But unlike Abraham, the merman can speak and thus can become a tragic hero. Indeed, he becomes a tragic hero if he saves Agnete but not himself.
- The merman's second choice is to marry Agnete and save himself through her. In this second choice he will have disclosed himself. Through his guilt over attempting to seduce Agnete, he comes out of the universal. In sin the demonic one is higher than the universal. In repentance the demonic one returns to the universal—or more aptly, "realizes" or "accomplishes" the universal.
- "If he ... lets himself be saved through Agnete, then he is the greatest human being I can imagine," Johannes says. The girl is not the hero, but rather the merman is, after he makes the "infinite movement of repentance" and then a second movement, not on his own strength but "on the strength of the absurd," in believing he can be saved. Thus the merman becomes a knight of faith if he puts his trust in Agnete.
- The meaning of the merman story juxtaposed with Abraham's trial has been interpreted by scholars of Kierkegaard in various ways. According to C. Stephen Evans, while most human beings are not demonic, all are anguished, and sin is a universal human condition. Since Johannes says that sin puts people outside the universal, no human being can become an authentic self merely by conforming to established ethical norms.
- In that sense "Abraham may provide a guiding star," says Evans, in that "the highest good for every individual is a relation to God." This is made possible by faith, "which in turn makes possible a healing transformation of the person of faith." Evans notes that Johannes does not present himself as a person of faith, but it is possible that Kierkegaard means readers to see themselves as being like the merman. All people need healing, made possible by faith, in which they enter into "an absolute relationship to the absolute."
- Johannes finally returns to Abraham toward the end of Problema 3, reminding the reader that his digressions serve not to make Abraham "more intelligible" but rather to show "his unintelligibility ... more in the round." Once again, he protests that he cannot understand Abraham but only admire and contemplate him.
- Abraham did not speak to Sarah, Eleazar, or Isaac. His silence was not in the realm of aesthetics, since it did not serve the purpose of saving him, and indeed, his sacrifice "for his own and God's sake is an outrage aesthetically."
- Abraham's silence is condemned by ethics, since ethics demands "an infinite movement which requires disclosure." The aesthetic hero can speak but chooses not to, while the genuine tragic hero sacrifices himself for the universal but is disclosed and thus becomes "the beloved son of ethics." Such is not the case for Abraham, who does nothing for the universal and remains concealed.
- "We are now at the paradox," Johannes says. Either the individual (Abraham) as "the particular" stands alone "in an absolute relation to the absolute, and then the ethical is not the highest," or once again Abraham is "done for" and is "neither a tragic nor an aesthetic hero."
- While the paradox may seem easy and convenient, in fact Abraham's lot can be nothing but "distress and anguish" because he cannot speak, since if he did speak, he could not make himself understood.
- Should he have unburdened himself to his loved ones, they would have told him that he should refrain from killing Isaac or, worse, have called him a hypocrite for attempting to show his love before carrying out the dreaded deed.
- In summary, Abraham makes two movements: the first is an "infinite movement of resignation" in giving up Isaac, and the second movement is of faith. He is comforted in this second movement, since he tells himself that Isaac's death will not happen, or if it does, somehow God will give him another Isaac "on the strength of the absurd."
- The tragic hero's story has an end. For example, Iphigenia accepts her father's decision in an infinite movement of resignation because his decision lies in the realm of the universal. But Abraham is not a tragic hero because he does not have this luxury.
- If it had fallen to Agamemnon to carry out his daughter's death sentence, it would not have been appropriate to say any parting words, but in the case of an intellectual tragic hero, some parting words may be in order, as was the case when Socrates was forced by the state to carry out his own execution.
- These analogies do not apply to Abraham, except in that when Isaac asks him where the sacrificial animal is, he must say something. He says, "My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering." In this statement the double movement of his soul is evident. He does not tell Isaac a lie, but neither does he answer the question, "for he speaks in a foreign tongue."
- His words show that he has made the infinite movement of resignation, since he is ready to act, and at the same time, his words reveal his faith in God. Johannes once again reiterates that he cannot understand Abraham and lacks the courage to speak in his way or act as he did. "But I do not at all say that what he did is inconsiderable on that account," says Johannes, "since on the contrary it is the one and only marvel."
- Abraham's achievement is considerable: he remains true to his love of God and consequently needs neither tears nor admiration. He even forgets his suffering completely; only God remembers it: "God sees in secret and knows the distress and counts the tears and forgets nothing."
- In Johannes's view either "the single individual as a particular stands in absolute relation to the absolute, or Abraham is done for."

# Epilogue 

## Key Takeaways

- One generation learns from another but can never learn "the genuinely human factor." In this realm every generation must start from scratch and never gets beyond what the previous generation did.
- This human factor is passion. No generation has learned from another how to love, and no generation gets beyond love.
- The highest passion is faith, and here too each generation begins and ends at the same place.
- The task of faith "is always enough for a human lifetime." The text asserts that faith is the highest passion, more than enough to occupy the span of a human life. Many people in a generation can get as far as faith, but none go beyond it.
- Johannes shares with the reader that he himself has far to go, although he does not wish to "get over it," as if faith was somehow a disease to be cured or a problem to be solved.
- Life is rich enough in tasks, even for one who doesn't get as far as faith, and a person who honestly loves their tasks won't have wasted their lives.
- But for those who come to faith, they will find that faith is a process, not a destination. Additionally, they can go no further than faith.
- The idea of going further is old. Heraclitus famously said that a person cannot wade in the same river twice, but one of his disciples, who went further, said, "one cannot do it even once." This statement reflects a Greek school of philosophy that denied movement altogether, or the idea that the senses reveal to the perceiver true knowledge of the real world.
- Thus Johannes concludes in the epilogue that there is nowhere to go beyond faith.

# Quotes


1.

 If an unfathomable, insatiable emptiness lay hid beneath everything, what then would life be but despair? 

[Johannes](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Fear-and-Trembling/key-figures/#Johannes), [Speech in Praise of Abraham](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Fear-and-Trembling/speech-in-praise-of-abraham-summary/)

Johannes begins his praise of Abraham by noting that if only emptiness lay beneath the manifestation of life, life would be nothing but despair for a human being because people need meaning. A human being must know that there is some order to existence and that a life counts in some way. Without such a belief a person falls into hopelessness and despair.

But human beings are bound to one another in time and in space. As God created man and woman, he also created the hero and the poet—the first performs meaningful acts, and the second sings the praises of the hero.

2.

 Can one speak unreservedly of Abraham ... without risking that someone will go off the rails and do likewise? 


Johannes makes this statement in the context of asking whether it is possible to speak honestly about Abraham. If a person praises Abraham, who would have willingly killed his son, won't that set a bad example for others who may think they have license to commit an immoral act? Johannes thinks it is possible to discuss Abraham by stressing his faith and his love for Isaac and the appalling nature (in Abraham's as well as the reader's) of the deed that God gave him to carry out.

3.

 Philosophy cannot and should not give us an account of faith. 

[Johannes](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Fear-and-Trembling/key-figures/#Johannes), [Preamble from the Heart](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Fear-and-Trembling/preamble-from-the-heart-summary/)

Johannes makes this comment in the context of saying that faith is not inferior to reasoning. Moreover, philosophy should "understand itself" and know what it has to offer, but at the same time it should not pretend that religion "is nothing." Thus, both faith and philosophy should be equally respected.

4.

 Faith is therefore no aesthetic emotion, but something far higher. 

[Johannes](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Fear-and-Trembling/key-figures/#Johannes), [Preamble from the Heart](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Fear-and-Trembling/preamble-from-the-heart-summary/)

Faith is higher than an aesthetic emotion because it goes beyond the immediate of sensuality. Faith is not "the immediate inclination of the heart but the paradox of existence." A person of faith first goes beyond desire in giving up what they want—to do so is the movement of resignation. But then they make a second movement in faith and believe their desire will be satisfied in the here and now.

5.

 Abraham is done for and faith has never existed in the world, just because it has always existed. 


[Johannes](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Fear-and-Trembling/key-figures/#Johannes), [Problema 1](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Fear-and-Trembling/problema-1-summary/)

Johannes proposes that if there is nothing higher than the social ethics found in the universal, then Abraham is "done for" and faith has never existed. What he means is that Abraham is then damned, and there is no such thing as faith, since the meaning of the word as acted on by Abraham cannot possibly exist. However, this is neither what Kierkegaard nor Johannes believes. Both believe faith is higher than the universal.

6.

 Faith finds its proper expression in him whose life is ... so paradoxical that it simply cannot be thought. 


[Johannes](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Fear-and-Trembling/key-figures/#Johannes), [Problema 1](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Fear-and-Trembling/problema-1-summary/)

Faith can be seen at work in a paradoxical life—a life so paradoxical that it cannot be thought. A paradoxical life is one lived through faith. The life of such a one cannot be understood through thought. Faith is absurd and cannot be rationalized. One cannot think about the paradox of faith. It remains unintelligible to the person living inside the universal. A person of faith acts on the strength of the absurd. As a single individuality, that person then rises above the universal.

7.

 Abraham's story contains a teleological suspension of the ethical. 

[Johannes](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Fear-and-Trembling/key-figures/#Johannes), [Problema 1](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Fear-and-Trembling/problema-1-summary/)

Johannes means that in the Abraham story, the normal telos or end purpose of the ethical, which is for a person to unite themselves in the universal, no longer exists. Once Abraham steps outside the ethical by deciding to obey God's command, he has suspended the ethical. Only by putting the will of God above the will of the universal does Abraham become a knight of faith.

8.

 The step of [the] tragic hero goes like a dance compared with the slow ... progress of the knight of faith. 

[Johannes](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Fear-and-Trembling/key-figures/#Johannes), [Problema 2](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Fear-and-Trembling/problema-2-summary/)

In Johannes's view the knight of faith has a much tougher time than the tragic hero. While the tragic hero may have to sacrifice something much beloved for the good of the universal—for example, Agamemnon sacrifices his daughter, Iphigenia, to appease an angry god—the tragic hero is always working within the realm of the universal. Agamemnon's actions can be understood and will not be condemned.

On the other hand, the knight of faith walks a solitary path and is understood by no one. Oftentimes, the actions of the knight of faith can appear monstrous to them.

9.

 In a sense there dwells infinitely more good in a demonic than in a superficial person. 

[Johannes](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Fear-and-Trembling/key-figures/#Johannes), [Problema 3](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Fear-and-Trembling/problema-3-summary/)

Johannes here is discussing the actions of the merman. The merman is a seducer who is overcome by the purity of an innocent. Thus he cannot continue to seduce her. He must either leave her without explaining the reason for his abandonment or else marry her and enter into the realm of the universal. But he is much superior to the superficial person who lives only in the realm of the aesthetic and the immediacy of the senses.

The merman is initially demonic, living outside of the universal as a transgressor. But he has a higher understanding of life and the possibility of redemption. He can become a knight of infinite resignation and even a knight of faith.

10.

 [Abraham] makes the infinite movement of resignation and gives up ... Isaac ... but then ... makes ... the movement of faith. 

[Johannes](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Fear-and-Trembling/key-figures/#Johannes), [Problema 3](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Fear-and-Trembling/problema-3-summary/)

Abraham as a knight of faith shows how a double movement makes him what he is. First Abraham must become a knight of infinite resignation. He realizes he cannot have Isaac, the beloved child of his old age, because God has demanded his sacrifice. But then he makes a second movement by taking a leap of faith, believing Isaac will be restored to him. In taking the leap of faith, he steps outside the universal and transcends it.

# Symbols

## The Knight of Infinite Resignation

The knight of infinite resignation symbolizes the person who turns their back on the finite world in favor of the infinite. They have risked everything on one burning desire. When the knight does not get their desire, they resign themselves to their loss. They do not push away the pain of the memory of the loss but rather transcend it by turning the particularity of their desire into a desire for [God](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Fear-and-Trembling/key-figure-analysis/#God) or the infinite. The knight's longing becomes entirely inward, and now their love cannot be snatched away from them. Either a man or a woman can be a knight of infinite resignation. While a tragic hero is not synonymous with a knight, the tragic hero often goes through the movement of infinite resignation in uniting with the universal. Resignation is the first step on the path to becoming a knight of faith.

## The Knight of Faith

The knight of faith symbolizes the person living in the highest sphere of consciousness or the sphere of the religious. The knight of faith looks like an ordinary person and is not easy to spot. The knight is similar to the person who lives in the aesthetic, in that they enjoy the finitude of the world. But this knight has made a double movement—first becoming a knight of infinite resignation and then making the leap of faith into the absurd, in which that person believes they will gain back all that has been lost. [Abraham](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Fear-and-Trembling/key-figure-analysis/#Abraham) is the knight of faith par excellence, but in [Kierkegaard](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Fear-and-Trembling/author/)'s philosophy, even if the knight does not at first get back what they have lost (as does Abraham), they continue to believe that they will get it back.

## The Butterfly and the Caterpillar

The narrator [Johannes](https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Fear-and-Trembling/key-figure-analysis/#Johannes) uses the symbolism of the butterfly and the caterpillar to explain the knight of infinite resignation. The knight who transmutes his or her suffering into something higher than a particular desire sheds the body of a caterpillar to become a butterfly. But unlike the caterpillar, the knight of resignation remembers his earlier stage—the chrysalis stage. The pain of being a caterpillar remains, and the knight uses the memory of pain to maintain the higher state of consciousness that is resignation.

# Glossary

**Absolute:** God or the divinity. In his use of the term "Absolute," Kierkegaard is playing off (but not agreeing with) Hegel's term "Absolute Mind," which is an undistorted, rational view of the truth that can be reached only through the intellect.

**absolute duty:** the duty to God, which may not be qualified nor changed in any way. Abraham achieved this, which means that in the realm of faith his relationship is not mediated in any way by outside forces or societal ethics.

**absurd:** a break from rational laws. The absurd is an event that cannot be rationally explained nor justified but rather transcends human or intelligible (understandable) possibility.

**aesthetic sphere:** the first and lowest of the three "spheres" in Kierkegaard's dialectical stages of existence. The aesthetic is a personal, sensory experience, which can range from fulfillment of bodily desires or lusts to the deep appreciation of art.

**dread:** anxiety or terror, from the Danish word "angst." Dread is an amorphous fear that people feel, especially when they become aware of their freedom to choose their own fate.

**dialectic:** from Hegelian philosophy, the process by which a thesis and antithesis (a thing or idea and its opposite) resolve themselves into a synthesis. In Hegel's view history is a continuous, dialectical movement, in which each synthesis moves the world toward a better, ideal state.

**ethical sphere:** the second of the three "spheres" in Kierkegaard's dialectical stages of existence. The ethical is the expression of the universal and includes actions that take place in the public realm.

**incommensurability:** the absence of a unit to measure two different entities. Sometimes Kierkegaard employs the term to mean two entities that are not strictly comparable—for example, the love of God and everyday reality.

**individual:** the single individual, as opposed to the universal. An individual expresses themselves either in the aesthetic sphere (living for their pleasure) or in the religious sphere (living for God)—but not in the ethical sphere, where the individual melds into the universal, sacrificing what is personal.

**leap of faith:** absurd movement into faith. A leap of faith is a personal choice to believe something that cannot be worked out or understood with the rational mind.

**mediation:** the process by which the dialectic resolves the thesis and its opposite into a synthesis. Mediation takes place in the realm of the rational, the ethical, and the universal, but there is no mediation in the realm of faith and religion.

**paradox:** a contradiction that upon closer inspection yields truth. The religious paradox is that the individual is higher than the universal, the finite is higher than the infinite, and a leap of faith takes place when a person embraces the absurd.

**particular:** the individual who rises above, or steps outside, the universal. A person expressing the particular can be demonic, as is the merman before he repents, or religious, like Abraham.

**telos:** the final goal of any action. Kierkegaard maintains that Hegel's telos of ethics is rightly suspended when a person of faith steps outside the universal to fulfill an absolute duty to God.

**temptation:** the allure of what is wrong or forbidden. Kierkegaard sometimes uses the word temptation as synonymous with God's test of Abraham's faith.

**universal:** the opposite of the individual. Whereas Hegel believed the universal to be the highest good, Kierkegaard has the knight of faith rise above the universal into the religious sphere.

# Biography

### A Melancholy Start

Søren Aabye Kierkegaard, whose last name is derived from the Danish word for _churchyard_ or _graveyard_, was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, on May 5, 1813. Kierkegaard's name originates in the fact that his father's family had for generations worked the land for the local priest in Jutland. The philosopher's father, Michael Pedersen Kierkegaard, was released from this familial obligation to the priest at age 21 and moved to Copenhagen to take up the hosiery business. He later became a wealthy importer and left Kierkegaard, the youngest of seven siblings, with a considerable amount of money when he died.

A shadow hung over Kierkegaard's family. His melancholy, guilt-ridden father brooded on the fact that he had once cursed God as a child and had fathered a child out of wedlock with his wife's maid. After his wife died, he married the maid, Kierkegaard's mother. Although they ended up with a large family, Kierkegaard lost a brother and sister before he was nine, and his remaining sisters, a brother, and his mother before he was 21. That left him with one brother, Peter, with whom he had a fraught relationship.

### Formative Years

Kierkegaard attended the School of Civic Virtue and enrolled in the University of Copenhagen in 1830. His major was theology, although he also studied liberal arts and the sciences. In his college years Kierkegaard gradually became estranged from both his father and Christianity. In 1837, at age 24, he met Regine Olsen, the teenage daughter of a dignitary. The following year he reconciled with both his father and Christianity and subsequently committed to becoming a Christian, a task he viewed as a lifelong undertaking. In 1838 his father died, as did Kierkegaard's academic mentor.

The young philosopher then took a break from school, living the life of a rich man about town, although his diaries show he was suffering from depression. Kierkegaard became engaged to Regine in 1840, and in that same year, he entered the Pastoral Seminary while also working on his doctorate. He defended his thesis _On_ _the Concept of Irony, with Constant Reference to Socrates_. But he also ended his engagement, apparently because he felt he was not fit for civic or family life.

### Literary Output

Beginning in 1843, Kierkegaard began rapidly publishing a number of books, including _Either/Or_, in two volumes, followed by _Repetition_ and _Fear and Trembling_; _Philosophical Fragments_ and _The Concept of Anxiety_ in 1844; _Stages on Life's Way_ (1845); _Concluding Unscientific Postscript_ (1846); _The Sickness unto Death_ (1849); and _Training in Christianity_ (1850). He published other works as well and kept extensive journals.

### Quarrels

Kierkegaard provoked a feud with a satirical weekly, which ended up mercilessly caricaturing his physical appearance. This quarrel made him something of a laughingstock for a while on the streets of Copenhagen, which was a small town. He also started a feud with the Danish State Church and its prominent leaders. Kierkegaard disliked the Hegelian Christianity being promoted by the state church, and he eventually became estranged from that organization.

### Death

Søren Kierkegaard died November 11, 1855, at age 42, possibly of a lung infection. He confessed on his deathbed to his boyhood friend Emil Boesen, the only pastor he would see, that his life had been "a great and to others unknown and incomprehensible suffering." He had predicted that _Fear and Trembling_ would "immortalize" him and even be translated into foreign languages, although he could never have imagined that his works would become international classics. He variously has been hailed as the father of 20th-century existentialism and the most important Christian critic of early secular rationalism.
