# Nhat's Personal Obsidian vault

i use Obsidian as my primary note taking app, as this is the most extendable, customizable and powerful tool for learning and building your own wikipedia (and works pretty well with vim motions too)

as you can see, i only hoard and write self-taught philosophy notes as this is the only side hobby that i truly care about.
