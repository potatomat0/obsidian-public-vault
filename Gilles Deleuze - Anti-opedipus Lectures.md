# Lecture 1: NOVEMBER 16, 1971

Traditional psychoanalysis enclosed the libidinal investments of desire in the familial triangle and structuralism is the last attempt [_tentative_] to save Oedipus at the moment when Oedipus is coming apart at the seams. The task of schizoanalysis is to see that parents play a role in the unconscious only as agents of interception, agents of transmission in a system of the flows of desire, of desiring machines, and what counts is my unconscious relation with my desiring machines.

### SEMINAR INTRODUCTION

When it first appeared in France, in 1972, _Anti-Oedipus_ was hailed as a masterpiece by some and decried as “a work of heretical madness” by others.As Deleuze indicates in this seminar, he had already spent the 1970-71 academic year outlining the ongoing collaboration with Félix Guattari, so given that the book’s publication (appearing in early 1972), these sessions constitute a continuation of the previous year’s work, allowing Deleuze to refine the developing with Guattari, most notably concerning the tasks of schizoanalysis and the intersection of the fields of political economy and psychoanalysis, as well as the continuing dominant and oppressive impact of this intersection both on society and subjectivity.

Deleuze with his son Julien at Le Mas Revery, near Saint-Léonard-de-Noblat, in the early 1960s.

Deleuze had already spent one academic year (1970-71) and possibly even part of the previous year considering key elements that would appear in _Anti-Oedipus,_ which was published in early 1972. Here Deleuze lays out material from _Anti-Oedipus_ chapter four, notably the grounds for the important tasks of schizo-analysis, in contrast to traditional psychoanalysis, and also returning to the positions developed in “Introduction to Schizo-analysis” (chapter 4). Deleuze connects capitalism directly to schizophrenia, both based on decoded and deterritorialized flows, their identity occurring at the level of the economic process, through a system of conjunction, deterriorializing flows and then tying together an identity. Responding to student questions, Deleuze explores the internal threats to society, the danger of flows decoding themselves, and he considers competing anthropological explanations of flows and their blockages and possible recourses for continued flows, including sorcery, all of which is swept away by the introduction of money with a new circuit of consumption given that capitalism no longer counts on any code. Deleuze also details the opposition posed by schizo-analysis to psychoanalysis’s introduction of the triangular axiomatic by emphasizing dual dimensions of desire: desiring machines working within the unconscious with no reference to Oedipus or castration, and desire understood in terms of its socio-political investments rather than familial. Hence the three tasks of schizo-analysis: the first destructive task, countering the Oedipal and castrating structures; a first positive task, a functional analysis of desiring machines; and a second positive task, understanding the investment of desiring machines in the social machines.

### **Codes, Capitalism, Flows, Decoding Flows, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, Psychoanalysis**

… What is it that moves over the body of a society? It is always flows, and a person is always a cutting off [_coupure_] of a flow. A person is always a point of departure for the production of a flow, a point of destination for the reception of a flow, a flow of any kind; or, better yet, an interception of many flows.

If a person has hair, this hair can move through many stages: the hairstyle of a young girl is not the same as that of a married woman, it is not the same as that of a widow: there is a whole hairstyle code. A person, insofar as she styles her hair, typically presents herself as an interceptor in relation to flows of hair that exceed her and exceed her case and these flows of hair are themselves coded according to very different codes: widow code, young girl code, married woman code, etc. This is ultimately the essential problem of coding and of the territorialization which is always coding flows with it, as a fundamental means of operation: marking persons (because persons are situated at the interception and at the cutting off [_coupure_] of flows, they exist at the points where flows are cut off [_coupure_]).

But now, more than marking persons—marking persons is the apparent means of operation—coding has a deeper function, that is to say, a society is only afraid of one thing: the deluge; it is not afraid of the void, it is not afraid of dearth or scarcity. Over a society, over its social body, something flows [_coule_] and we do not know what it is, something flows that is not coded, and something which, in relation to this society, even appears as the uncodable. Something which would flow and which would carry away this society to a kind of deterritorialization which would make the earth upon which it has set itself up dissolve: this, then, is the crisis. We encounter something that crumbles, and we do not know what it is, it responds to no code, it flees underneath the codes.

And this is even true, in this respect, for capitalism which for a long time believed it could always secure simili-codes; this, then, is what we call the well-known power [_puissance_] of recuperation within capitalism—when we say recuperate we mean: each time something seems to escape capitalism, seems to pass beneath its simili-codes; it reabsorbs all this, it adds one more axiom and the machine starts up again. Think of capitalism in the 19th century: it sees the flowing of a pole of flow that is, literally, a flow, the flow of workers, a proletariat flow: well, what is this which flows, which flows wickedly and which carries away our earth, where are we headed? The thinkers of the 19th century have a very strange response, notably the French historical school: it was the first in the 19th century to have thought in terms of classes, they are the ones who invent the theoretical notion of classes and invent it precisely as an essential fragment of the capitalist code, namely: the legitimacy of capitalism comes from this: the victory of the bourgeoisie as a class opposed to the aristocracy.

The system that appears in the works of Saint Simon, Augustin Thierry, Edgar Quinet is the radical seizure of consciousness by the bourgeoisie as a class and they interpret all of history as a class struggle. It is not Marx who invents the understanding of history as a class struggle, it is the bourgeois historical school of the 19th century: 1789, yes, it is a class struggle, they are struck blind when they see flowing, on the actual surface of the social body, this weird flow that they do not recognize: the proletariat flow. The idea that this is a class is not possible, it is not one at this moment: the day when capitalism can no longer deny that the proletariat is a class, this coincides with the moment when, in its head, it found the moment to recode all this.

That which we call the power [_puissance_] of recuperation of capitalism, what is it? [It consists] in having at its disposal a kind of axiomatic, and when it sets upon [_dispose de_] some new thing which it does not recognize, as with every axiomatic, it is an axiomatic with a limit that cannot be saturated: it is always ready to add one more axiom to restore its functioning.

When capitalism can no longer deny that the proletariat is a class, when it comes to recognize a type of class bipolarity, under the influence of workers’ struggles in the 19th century, and under the influence of the revolution, this moment is extraordinarily ambiguous, for it is an important moment in the revolutionary struggle, but it is also an essential moment in capitalist recuperation: I make you one more axiom, I make you axioms for the working class and for the union power [_puissance_] that represents them, and the capitalist machine grinds its gears and starts up again, it has sealed the breach. In other words, all the bodies of a society are essential: to prevent the flowing over society, over its back, over its body, of flows that it cannot code and to which it cannot assign a territoriality.

Need, scarcity, famine, a society can code these, what it cannot code, is when this thing appears, when it says to itself: what is up with these guys? So, in a first phase, the repressive apparatus puts itself into motion, if we can’t code it, we will try to annihilate it. In a second phase, we try to find new axioms which allow it to be recoded for better or worse.

A social body is well defined as follows: there is perpetual trickery, flows flow over from one pole to another, and they are perpetually coded, and there are flows that escape from the codes. And then there is the social effort to recuperate all that, to axiomatize all this, to manipulate the code a little, so as to make room for flows that are also dangerous: all of a sudden. There are young people who do not respond to the code: they insist on having a flow of hair which was not expected, what shall we do now? We try to recode it, we will add an axiom, we will try to recuperate [it] but then [if] there is something within it that continues not to let itself be coded, what then?

In other words, this is the fundamental action of a society: to code the flows and to treat as an enemy anyone who presents himself, in relation to society, as an uncodable flow, because, once again, it challenges [_met en question_] the entire earth, the whole body of this society.

I will say this of every society, except perhaps of our own—that is, capitalism, even though just now I spoke of capitalism as if it coded all the flows in the same way as all other societies and did not have any other problems, but perhaps I was going too fast.

There is a fundamental paradox in capitalism as a social formation: if it is true that the terror of all the other social formations was decoded flows, capitalism, for its part, historically constituted itself on an unbelievable thing: namely, that which was the terror of other societies: the existence and the reality of decoded flows and these, capitalism made its proper concern.

If this were true, it would explain that capitalism is, in a very precise sense, the universal form of all societies: in a negative sense, capitalism would be that which all societies dreaded above all, and we cannot help but have the impression that, historically speaking, capitalism… In a certain sense, is what every social formation constantly tried to exorcise, what it constantly tried to avoid, why? Because it was the ruin of every other social formation. And the paradox of capitalism is that a social formation constituted itself on the basis of that which was the negative of all the others. This means that capitalism was not able to constitute itself except through a conjunction, an encounter between decoded flows of all kinds. The thing which was dreaded most of all by every social formation was the basis for a social formation that had to engulf all the others: that what was the negative of all formations has become the very positivity of ours, this makes one shudder.

And in what sense was capitalism constituted on the conjunction of decoded flows? It required extraordinary encounters at the end of a process [_processus_] of decodings of every kind, which were formed with the decline of feudalism. These decodings of all kinds consisted in the decoding of land flows, under the form of the constitution of large private properties, the decoding of monetary flows, under the form of the development of merchant fortunes, the decoding of a flow of workers under the form of expropriation, of the deterritorialization of serfs and peasant landholders. And this is not enough, for if we take the example of Rome, the decoding in decadent Rome, all this clearly happened: the decoding of flows of property under the form of large private properties, the decoding of monetary flows under the forms of large private fortunes, the decoding of laborers with the formation of an urban sub-proletariat: everything is found here, almost everything. The elements of capitalism are found here all together, only there is no encounter.

What was necessary for the encounter to be made between the decoded flows of capital or of money and the decoded flows of laborers, for the encounter to be made between the flow of emergent capital and the flow of deterritorialized manpower, literally, the flow of decoded money and the flow of deterritorialized laborers. Indeed, the manner in which money is decoded so as to become money capital and the manner in which the laborer is ripped from the earth in order to become the owner of his/her labor power [_force de travail_] alone: these are two processes totally independent from each other, there must be an encounter between the two.

Indeed, for the process of the decoding of money to form capital that is made all across the embryonic forms of commercial capital and banking capital, the flow of labor, the free possessor of his/her labor power alone, is made across a whole other line that is the deterritorialization of the laborer at the end of feudalism, and this could very well not have been encountered. A conjunction of decoded and deterritorialized flows, this is at the basis of capitalism. Capitalism is constituted on the failure of all the pre-existent codes and social territorialities.

If we admit this, what does this represent? The capitalist machine, it is literally demented. A social machine that functions on the basis of decoded, deterritorialized flows, once again, it is not that societies did not have any idea of this; they had the idea in the form of panic, they acted to prevent this — it was the overturning of all the social codes known up to that point — ; so, a society that constitutes itself on the negative of all pre-existing societies, how can it function? A society for which it is proper to decode and deterritorialize all the flows — flow of production, flow of consumption — how can it function, under what form? Perhaps capitalism has other processes than coding to make it work, perhaps it is completely different.

What I have been seeking up until now was to reground, at a certain level, the problem of the relation capitalism / schizophrenia, and the grounding of a relation is found in something common between capitalism and the schizo: what they have totally in common. And it is perhaps a community that is never realized, that does not assume a concrete figure; it is a community of a principle that remains abstract, namely, the one like the other does not cease to filter, to emit, to intercept, to concentrate decoded and deterritorialized flows.

This is their profound identity, and it is not at the level of a way of life that capitalism renders us schizophrenic. It is at the level of the economic process: all this only works through a system of conjunction — say the word then — on condition of accepting that this word implies a veritable difference in nature from codes. It is capitalism that functions like an axiomatic, an axiomatic of decoded flows. All other social formations functioned on the basis of a coding and of a territorialization of flows and between a capitalist machine that makes an axiomatic of decoded flows such as they are or deterritorialized flows, such as they are, and other social formations, there is truly a difference in nature that makes capitalism the negative of other societies. Now, the schizo, in his own way, with his own tottering walk, he does the same thing. In a sense, he is more capitalist than the capitalist, more `prole’ than the `prole’: he decodes, he deterritorializes the flows and knots together a kind of identity in nature of capitalism and the schizo.

Schizophrenia is the negative of the capitalist formation. In a sense, schizophrenia goes further, capitalism functioned on a conjunction of decoded flows, on one condition, that is, at the same time that it perpetually decoded flows of money, flows of labor, etc., it incorporated them, it constructed a new type of machine, at the same time, not afterwards, that was not a coding machine, but an axiomatic machine.

It is in this way that it succeeds in making a coherent system, on condition that we say what profoundly distinguishes an axiomatic of decoded flows and a coding of flows. Whereas the schizo, he does more, he does not let himself be axiomatized either, he always goes further with the decoded flows, making do with no flows at all, rather than letting himself be coded, no earth at all, rather than letting himself be territorialized.

What is their relation to each other? It is from this point that the problem arises. One must study more closely the relation capitalism / schizophrenia, giving the greatest importance to this: is it true and in what sense can we define capitalism as a machine that functions on the basis of decoded flows, on the basis of deterritorialized flows? In what sense is it the negative of all social formations, and along the same lines, in what sense is schizophrenia the negative of capitalism, that it goes even further in decoding and in deterritorialization? And just where does it go, and where does that take it? Towards a new earth, towards no earth at all, towards the deluge?

If I try to link up with the problems of psychoanalysis, in what sense, in what manner—this is strictly a beginning—, I assume that there is something in common between capitalism, as a social structure, and schizophrenia as a process. Something in common that makes it so that the schizo is produced as the negative of capitalism — itself the negative of all the rest –, and that this relation, we can now comprehend it by considering its terms: coding of flows, decoded and deterritorialized flows, axiomatic of decoded flows, etc.

It remains to be seen what in the psychoanalytic and psychiatric problem continues to preoccupy us. One must reread three texts of Marx: in book I: the production of surplus value, the chapter on the tendential fall in the last book, and finally, in the _Grundrisse,_ the chapter on automation.

**Richard Zrehen:** I did not understand what you said in regard to the analogy between capitalism and schizophrenia, when you said capitalism is the negative of other societies and the schizo is the negative of capitalism, I would have understood that capitalism is to other societies what the schizo is to capitalism, but, I would have thought, on the contrary, that you were not going to make this opposition. I would have thought of the opposition: capitalism / other societies and schizophrenia/ something else, instead of an analogy in three terms, to make one in four terms.

**Cyril:** Richard means to say the opposition between: capitalism/ other societies and schizophrenia and neuroses, for example.

**Deleuze:** Haaa, yes, yes, yes, yes. We are defining flows in political economy, its importance with actual economists confirms what I have been saying. For the moment, a flow is something, in a society, that flows from one pole to another, and that passes through a person, only to the degree that persons are interceptors.

**A student: [_Inaudible comment_]**

**Deleuze:** Let me take an example, you say that in a society one does not stop decoding, I’m not sure: I believe that there are two things in a society, one of which pertains to the principle by which a society comes to an end [_se termine_], one of which pertains to the death of a society: all death, in a certain manner, appears—this is the great principle of Thanatos—from inside [_dedans_] and all death comes from outside [_dehors_]. I mean that there is an internal menace in every society, this menace being represented by the danger of flows decoding themselves, it makes sense.

There is never a flow first, and then a code that imposes itself upon it. The two are coexistent. Which is the problem, if I again take up the studies, already quite old, of [Claude] Levi-Strauss on marriage: he tells us: the essential in a society is circulation and exchange. Marriage, alliance, is exchanging, and what is important is that it circulates and that it exchanges. There is, then, a flow of women—raising something to a coefficient flow seems to me to be a social operation, the social operation of flows. At the level of society, there are no women, there is a flow of women that refers to a code, a code of age-old things, of clans, of tribes, but there is always flow of women, and then, in a second moment, a code: the code and the flow are absolutely formed face to face with one another.

What is it the problem then, at the level of marriage, in a so-called primitive society? It is that, in relation to flows of women, by virtue of a code, there is something that must pass through. It involves forming a sort of system, not at all like Levi-Strauss suggests, not at all a logical combinatory [_combinatoire_], but a physical system with territorialities: something enters, something exits. So here we clearly see that, brought into relation with a physical system of marriage, women present themselves in the form of a flow. Regarding this flow, the social code means this: in relation to such a flow, something of the flow must pass through, i.e.: flow; something must not go through; and, third — this will make up the three fundamental terms of every code — something must effect the passing through or, on the contrary, the blocking: for example, in matrilineal systems, everyone knows the importance of the maternal [_utérine_] uncle, why, in the flow of women, what passes through is the permitted or even prescribed marriage.

A schizo, in a society like that, he is not there; literally, it belongs to us, over there, it is something else.

There, it is different: there is a very good case studied by Pierre Clastres; there is a guy who does not know, he does not know whom he must marry, he attempts a voyage of deterritorialization to see a faraway sorcerer.[[1]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-01-15/#_edn1) There is a great English ethnologist named [Edmund] Leach whose whole thesis consists in saying: it never works like Levi-Strauss says it does, he does not believe in Levi-Strauss’s system: no one knows who to marry; Leach makes a fundamental discovery, that which he calls local groups and distinguishes from groups of filiation. Local groups, these are the little groups that machine [_machinent_] marriages and alliances and they do not deduce them from filiations: the alliance is a kind of strategy that responds to political givens. A local group is literally a group (perverse, specialists in coding) that determines, for each caste, what can pass through, what cannot pass through, that which must be blocked, that which can flow.[[2]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-01-15/#_edn2)

In a matrilineal system, what is blocked? That which is blocked in all systems, that which falls under the rules of the prohibition of incest. Here, something in the flow of women is blocked; namely, certain persons are eliminated from the flow of marriageable women, in relation to other persons. That which, on the contrary, passes through is, we could say, the first permitted incest: the first legal incests in the form of preferential marriages; but everyone knows that the first permitted incests are never practiced in fact, it is still too close to that which is blocked. You see that the flow is interrupted here, something in the flow is blocked, something passes through, and here, there are the great perverts who machine marriages, who block or who effect passages. In the history of the maternal uncle, the aunt is blocked as an image of forbidden incest, in the form of a jesting kinship, the nephew has, with his aunt, a very joyous relation, with his uncle, a relation of theft, but theft, injuries, these are coded; see [Bronislaw] Malinowski.

**A student:** These local groups have magical powers?

**Deleuze:** They have an overtly political power [_pouvoir_], they sometimes call upon sorcery, but they are not witchcraft groups, they are political groups who define the strategy of a village in relation to another village, and a clan in relation to another clan.

Every code in relation to flows implies that we prevent something of this flow from passing through, we block it, we let something pass: there will be people having a key position as interceptors, i.e. so as to prevent passage or, on the contrary, to effect passage, and when we take note that these characters are such that, according to the code, certain prestations return to them; we better understand how the whole system works.

In all societies, the problem was always to code flows and to recode those that tended to escape—when is it that the codes vacillate in so-called primitive societies: essentially at the moment of colonialization, there where the code flees under the pressure of capitalism. For that is what it represents in a society of codes, the introduction of money; it scatters to the winds their entire circuit of flows, in the sense that they distinguish essentially three types of flows: the flows of production to be consumed, the flows of prestige, objects of prestige and flows of women. When money is introduced therein, it is a catastrophe — see what [Robert] Jaulin analyses as ethnocide: money, Oedipus complex.[[3]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-01-15/#_edn3)

They try to relate money to their code, as such it can only be a prestige good. It is not a production or consumption good, it is not a woman, but the young people of the tribe who understand quicker than the elders take advantage of money in order to seize hold of the circuit of consumption goods, the circuit of consumption that was traditionally, in certain tribes, controlled by women. So the young people, with money, seize hold of the circuit of consumption. With money which itself can no longer be coded, within a certain framework, we begin with money, and we end with money.

M[oney]-C[ommodity]-M[oney], there is absolutely no means of coding this thing here because the qualified flows are replaced by a flow of abstract quantity whose proper essence is the infinite reproduction for which the formula is M-C-M. No code can support infinite reproduction. What is formidable in so-called primitive societies is how debt exists, but exists in the form of a finite block, debt is finite.

So, in this sense flows pass their time by fleeing, it does not prevent the codes from being correlative and coding the flows. Undoubtedly, it escapes from all sides, and the one who does not let her/himself be coded, and so we say: that’s a madman; we will code him/her: the village madman, we will make a code of the code.

The originality of capitalism is that it no longer counts on any code. There are code residues, but no one believes in them: we no longer believe in anything. The last code that capitalism knew how to produce was fascism: an effort to recode and reterritorialize even at the economic level, at the level of the functioning of the market in the fascist economy. Here we clearly see an extreme effort to resuscitate a kind of code that would function like the code of capitalism; literally, it could have lasted in the form in which it has lasted. As for capitalism, it is incapable of furnishing a code that covers the ensemble of the social field like a grid [_quadrille_], because its problems no longer pose themselves in terms of code. Its problem is to make a mechanism of decoded flows as such, so it is uniquely in this sense that I oppose capitalism as a social formation to all the other known social formations.

Can we say that between a coding of flows corresponding to pre-capitalist formations and a decoded axiomatic, there is a difference in nature, or is there simply a variation? There is a radical difference in nature**!** Capitalism cannot furnish any code.

We cannot say that the struggle against a system is totally independent of the manner in which this system was characterized. It is difficult to consider that the struggle of socialism against capitalism in the 19th century was independent of the theory of surplus value, in so far as this theory specified the characteristic of capitalism.

Suppose that capitalism can be defined as an economic machine excluding the codes and making decoded flows function by taking them into an axiomatic. This already permits us to bring together the capitalist situation and the schizophrenic situation. Even at the level of analysis that has a practical influence, the analysis of monetary mechanisms (the neocapitalist economists, this is schizophrenic) when we see how the monetary practice of capitalism works, at the concrete level, and not just in theory, its schizoid character, can we say that it is totally indifferent to revolutionary practice**?**

All that we are doing in relation to psychoanalysis and psychiatry comes down to what? Desire, or, it matters little, the unconscious: it is not imaginary or symbolic, it is uniquely machinic, and as long as you have not reached the region of the machine of desire, as long as you remain in the imaginary, the structural or the symbolic, you do not have a genuine hold on the unconscious. They are machines that, like all machines, are confirmed as such by their functioning. Confirmations: the painter [Richard] Lindner obsessed by “Boy with machine”, a huge little boy in the foreground holding a strange little machine, a kind of little kite and behind him, a big social technical machine and his little machine is plugged into the big one, in the background.[[4]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-01-15/#_edn4) That is what I attempted last year to call the orphan unconscious, the true unconscious, the one that does not pass through daddy-mommy, the one that passes through delirious machines, these being in a given relation with the large social machines.

Second confirmation: an Englishman, W.G. Niederland, did research on Schreber’s father.[[5]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-01-15/#_edn5) This is what I object to in the text of Freud: it is as if psychoanalysis was a veritable millstone which crushed the deepest character of the guy, namely, his social character… When we read Schreber, the Great Mongol, the Aryans, the Jews, etc. And when we read Freud, not a word about all this, it is as if it was just some manifest content and that one had to discover the latent content = the eternal daddy-mommy of Oedipus. All the political, politico-sexual, politico-libidinal content, because in the end, when Schreber père imagined himself to be a little Alsatian girl defending Alsace against a French officer, there is political libido here. It is sexual and political at the same time, the one in the other; we learn that Schreber was well-known because he had invented a system of education == Schreber Gardens. He had produced a system of universal pedagogy.

Schizoanalysis procedes in a direction that is the opposite of psychoanalysis, indeed, each time that the subject narrates something that brings her/him in the vicinity of Oedipus or castration, the schizo being analyzed says “Enough.” What he sees as important, is that: Schreber père invents a pedagogic system of universal value, that is not brought to bear on his own child, but globally: Pangymnasticon. If we suppress from the delirium [_delire_] of the son the politico-global dimension of the paternal pedagogic system, we can longer understand anything. The father does not supply a structural function, but a political system: I am saying that the libido passes through here, not through daddy and mommy, through the political system. In the Pangymnasticon, there are machines: no system without machines, a system, rigorously speaking, is a structural unity of machines, so much so that one must burst the system to reach the machines. And what are Schreber’s machines: they are sado-paranoiac machines, a type of delirious machine. They are sado-paranoiac in the sense that they are applied to children, preferably to little girls.

With these machines, the children stay calm; in this delirium, the universal pedagogic dimension clearly appears: it is not a delirium about his son, it is a delirium that he constructs about the formation of a higher race. Schreber père acts against his son, not as a father, but as a libidinal promoter of a delirious investment of the social field. It is no longer the paternal function, but rather that the father is there to make something delirious pass through. This is certain, but the father acts here as an agent of transmission in relation to a field that is not the familial field, but that is a political and historical field, once again, the names of history and not the name of the father.

**Georges Comtesse:** We do not catch flies with vinegar, even if it’s machinic.

**Deleuze:** Schreber père’s system had a global development (belts for good conduct). It was a big social machine, and it was, at the same time, sown in the social machine, full of little delirious sado-paranoiac machines. So too, in the delirium of the son, certainly it is papa, but as a representative of what authority does he intervene. He intervenes as an agent of transmission in a libidinal investment of a certain type of social formation. On the contrary, the drama of psychoanalysis is the eternal familialism that consists in referring the libido, and with it all sexuality, to the familial machine, and we can go on to structuralize it, it changes nothing, we remain within the closed circle of: symbolic castration, structuring function of the family, parental characters, and we continue to crush all the outside [_dehors_]. [Maurice] Blanchot: a new type of relation with the outside.[[6]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-01-15/#_edn6)

Yet, and this is the critical point, psychoanalysis tends to suppress any relation of itself and of the subject who has just been analyzed with the outside. On itself alone it pretends to reterritorialize us, onto the territoriality or onto the most mediocre earth, the most shabby, the oedipal territoriality, or worse, onto the couch. Here, we clearly see the relation of psychoanalysis and capitalism: if it is true that in capitalism, flows are decoded, are deterritorialized constantly, i.e. that capitalism produces the schizo like it produces money, the whole capitalist project [_tentative_] consists in reinventing artificial territorialities in order to reinscribe people, to vaguely recode them: they invent anything: HLM [_Habitation à Loyer Moyen_, i.e.: government-controlled housing], home, and there is familial reterritorialization, the family, it is after all the social cell, so they will reterritorialize the guy in a family (community psychiatry): they reterritorialize people there where all the territorialities are floating ones, they proceed through an artificial, imaginary, residual reterritorialization.

And psychoanalysis—classical psychoanalysis—fabricates familial reterritorialization, most of all by skipping over all that is effective in delirium, all that is aggressive in delirium, namely, that delirium is a system of politico-social investments, not just of any type: it is the libido that hooks itself onto political social determinations. Schreber is not dreaming at all when he makes love to his mother; he dreams when he is being raped like a little Alsacian girl by a French officer. This depends on something much deeper than Oedipus, namely, the manner in which the libido invests social formations, to the point that one must distinguish two types of social investments by desire: social investments of interests that are of the preconscious type, that, if necessary, pass through classes. And below these, not exactly in harmony with them, unconscious investments, the libidinal investments of desire.

Traditional psychoanalysis enclosed the libidinal investments of desire in the familial triangle and structuralism is the last attempt [_tentative_] to save Oedipus at the moment when Oedipus is coming apart at the seams.

The task of schizoanalysis is to see that parents play a role in the unconscious only as agents of interception, agents of transmission in a system of the flows of desire, of desiring machines, and what counts is my unconscious relation with my desiring machines. What are my own desiring machines, and, through them, the unconscious relation of these desiring machines with the large social machines with which they carry out…and that hence, there is no reason to support psychoanalysis in its attempt to reterritorialize us.

I take an example from [Serge] Leclaire’s last book [Démasquer le réel _(Paris: Seuil, 1971); see_ Anti-Oedipus, _pp. 323-324_]; there is something that no longer works: “The most fundamental act in the history of psychoanalysis was a decentering that consisted in passing from the parents’ room as referent to the analytical office.” There was a time when we believed in Oedipus, and in the reality of seduction, it was not going strong even then, because the whole unconscious had been familiarized, a crushing of the libido onto daddy-mommy-me: the whole development of psychoanalysis was made in this direction [_sens_]: substitution of the phantasm for real seduction and substitution of castration for Oedipus. Leclaire: “To tell the truth, the displacement of the living kernel of the oedipal conjuncture, of the familial scene to the psychoanalytic scene, is strictly correlative to a sociological mutation in which we can psychoanalytically demarcate a recourse to the level of the familial institution,” page 30. The family is shabby: the unconscious protests and no longer works to triangulate itself, happily there is the analyst to serve as a relay.

It no longer supports the family, custody and the concealment [_dérobement_] of an all-powerful real. We say, ouf!, we will finally have a relation with the extra familial real, ha! no! says Leclaire, for that which serves as a relay for the family, and that which becomes the guardian, the unveiling veiling of the all-powerful real is the office of the analyst.

You can no longer triangulate, oedipalize in the family; it no longer works. You will come onto the couch to triangulate and oedipalize yourself. And indeed, adds Leclaire: “If the psychoanalytic couch has become the place where the confrontation with the real is unfolded.” The confrontation with the real does not take place on the earth, in the movement of territorialization, reterritorialization, of deterritorialization, it takes place on this rotten earth that is the couch of the analyst. “It is of no importance that the oedipal scene has no referent exterior to the office, that castration has no referent outside the office of the analyst,” which signifies that psychoanalysis, like capitalism, finds itself faced with the decoded flows of desire, finds itself before the schizophrenic phenomena of decoding and deterritorialization, has chosen to make for itself a little axiomatic. The couch, the ultimate earth of European man today, his very own little earth.

This situation of psychoanalysis tends to introduce an axiomatic excluding all reference, excluding all relation with the outside whatever it may be, appears as a catastrophic movement of interiority when it comes to understanding the true investments of desire. From the moment we seized upon the family as referent, it was all screwed up. The last earth, the couch that valorizes and justifies itself on its own terms. It was compromised from the beginning, from the moment when we cut desire off from the double dimension—what I call the double dimension of desire: and its relation, on the one hand, with desiring machines irreducible to any symbolic or structural dimension, to functional desiring machines, and the problem of schizoanalysis is to know how these desiring machines work, and to reach the level where they work in someone’s unconscious, which assumes that we will skip over Oedipus, castration, etc.

On the other hand, with social-political-cosmic investments, and here one must not say, that there would be any desexualization of the findings of psychoanalysis, for I am saying that desire, in its fundamental sexual form, can only be understood in its sexual investments. In so far as they do not bear on daddy-mommy, this is secondary, but in so far as they bear, on the one hand, on desiring machines, and on the other hand, in so far as they traverse our sexual, homosexual, heterosexual loves.

What is invested is always what cuts up [_des coupures_] of the dimensions of a historical social field, and certainly, the father and the mother play a role within it, they are agents of communication of desiring machines, on one hand of the machines with each other, and on the other hand, of the desiring machines with the large desiring machines.

Schizoanalysis is made up of three operations: A destructive task: skipping over the oedipal and castrating structures in order to reach a region of the unconscious where there is no castration etc., because desiring machines ignore this.

A positive task: That is to see and to analyze functionally, there is nothing to interpret = we do not interpret a machine, we grasp its functioning and its failures, the why of its failures: it is the oedipal collar, the psychoanalytic collar of the couch that introduces failures into desiring machines.

The third task: Desiring machines only work as long as they invest the social machines. And what are the types of libidinal investments, distinct from the preconscious investments of interests? These sexual investments — cross all the beings that we love, all our loves — it is a complex of deterritorialization and reterritorialization, that which we love. It is always a certain mulatto, a movement of deterritorialization and reterritorialization; it is not the scrawny and hysteric territoriality of the couch. And across each being that we love, what we invest is a social field; these are the dimensions of this social field, and the parents are agents of transmission in the social field.

See George Jackson’s letter,[[7]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-01-15/#_edn7) the classic black mother who says to her son, don’t fool around and marry well, make money. This classic mother here, is she acting like a mother and like an oedipal object of desire, or is she acting in such a way that she transmits a certain type of libidinal investment of the social field, namely the type that marries well, he makes love, and this in the strictest sense of the term, with something through his wife, unconsciously, with a certain number of economic, political, social processes? And that love has always been a means through which the libido attains something other than the beloved person, namely a whole cutting up [_découpage_] of the historical social field, ultimately we always make love with the names of history.

The other mother [of Jackson] — the one who says “grab your gun” — it follows that the two act as agents of transmission in a certain type of social-historical investment, that from one to the other the pole of these investments has singularly changed, that in one case, we can say that they are reactionary investments, at the limit fascist, in the other case, it is a revolutionary libidinal investment. Our loves are like the conduits and the pathways of these investments that are not, once again, of a familial nature, but of a historico-political nature. And the final problem of schizoanalysis is not only the positive study of desiring machines, but the positive study of the manner in which desiring machines carry out the investment of social machines, whether it be in forming investments of the libido of a revolutionary type, whether it be in forming libidinal investments of the revolutionary type.

The domain of schizoanalysis distinguishes itself at this moment from the domain of politics, in the sense that the preconscious political investments are investments of class interests that are determinable by certain types of studies. But these still do not tell us anything about the other type of investments, namely specifically libidinal investments — desire. To the point that it can happen that a preconscious revolutionary investment can be doubled by a libidinal investment of the fascist type = which explains how displacements are made from one pole of delirium to another pole of delirium, how a delirium has fundamentally two poles—which Artaud said so well: “the mystery of all is `Heliogabalus the Anarchist,” because these are the two poles. It is not only a contradiction; it is a fundamental human contradiction, namely a pole of unconscious investment of the fascist type, and an unconscious investment of the revolutionary type. What fascinates me in a delirium is the radical absence of daddy-mommy, except as agents of transmission, except as agents of interception for there they have a role. But on the other hand, the task of schizoanalysis is to release in delirium the unconscious dimensions of a fascist investment and a revolutionary investment, and at a certain point, it slips; at a certain point it oscillates, this is the deep domain of the libido.

In the most reactionary, most folkloric territoriality, a revolutionary ferment can surge forth — we never know — something schizo, something mad, a deterritorialization: the Basque problem. They did much for fascism; in other conditions, these same minorities could have determined — I am not saying this happens by chance — they could have secured a revolutionary role. It is extremely ambiguous: it is not at the level of political analysis, it is at the level of analysis of the unconscious: the way it whirls about [_comment ça tourne_]. (Maud Mannoni: antipsychiatry in the question of the court judgement on Schreber = a completely fascist delirium).[[8]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-01-15/#_edn8) If antipsychiatry has a sense, if schizoanalysis has a sense, it is at the level of an analysis of the unconscious, to tip delirium from the pole that is always present, the reactionary fascist pole that implies a certain type of libidinal investment, towards the other pole, no matter if it is hard and slow, the revolutionary pole.

**Richard Zheren:** Why only two poles?

**Deleuze:** We can make many, but fundamentally, there are clearly two great types of investment, two poles. The reference of libidinal investments is daddy-mommy; these are the territorialities, and the deterritorializations, this must be found in the unconscious, especially at the level of its loves. Phantasm of naturality: of a pure race, movement of the pendulum = revolutionary phantasm of deterritorialization.

If you’re saying that, on the analyst’s couch, what flows still flows, alright then. But the problem that I would pose here is: there are types of flow that pass beneath the door, what psychoanalysts call the viscosity of the libido, an overly viscous libido that does not let itself be grasped by the code of psychoanalysis, alright here yes, there is deterritorialization. But psychoanalysis says: negative reaction [_contre-indication_]. What annoys me in psychoanalysis of the Lacanian camp is the cult of castration.

The family is a system of transmission, the social investments of one generation passed on to another, but I absolutely do not think that the family is a necessary element in the making of social investments because, in any case, there are desiring machines that, on their own, constitute social libidinal investments of the large social machines. If you say: the madman is someone who remains with his desiring machines and who does not carry out social investments, I do not follow you. In all madness, I see an intense investment of a particular type of historical, political, social field, even in catatonic persons. This goes for adults as well as children, it is from earliest childhood that the desiring machines are plugged into the social field.

In themselves, all territorialities are equal to each other in relation to the movement of deterritorialization, but there is something like a schizoanalysis of territorialities, of their types of functioning. And by functioning, I understand the following: if the desiring machines are on the side of a great deterritorialization, i.e. on the path of desire beyond territorialities, if to desire is to be deterritorialized, one must say that each type of territoriality is able to support such or such a genre of machinic index: the machinic index is that which, in a territoriality, will be able to make it flee in the direction [_sens_] of a deterritorialization.

So, I take the example of the dream, from the point of view that I am attempting to explicate the role of machines, it is very important, different from that of psychoanalysis. When a plane flies or a sewing machine — the dream is a kind of little imaginary territoriality, sleep or a nightmare is a deterritorialization — we can say that deterritorialization and the reterritorialities only exist as a function of each other. But you can evaluate the force of a possible deterritorialization from the indexes on such or such a territoriality, i.e. how much it supports of a flow that flees. Flee and in fleeing, makes flee, not the others, but something from the system, a fragment.

A machinic index in a territoriality is what measures the power [_puissance_] of flight in this territoriality by making flows flee, in this regard all territorialities are not equal to each other. There are artificial territorialities; the more it flees and the more we can flee while fleeing, the more it is deterritorialized. Our loves are always situated on a territoriality that, in relation to us, deterritorializes us or else reterritorializes us. In this regard, there are misunderstandings + a whole game of investments that are the problem of schizoanalysis. Instead of having the family as a referent, it has as a referent the movements of deterritoralization and reterritorialization.

**Richard Zrehen:** I want to say that you employed the term “code” for so-called primitive societies. While I think it is not possible to think of them in terms of code, because of the well-known mark, because there is a mark, which requires exchange, it is because there is a debt that we have an obligation to exchange. What happens from their society to ours, is the loss of the debt, so when you say that the schizo is the negative of the capitalist and that capitalism is the negative of primitive societies, it is evident exactly what is lost, it is castration.

With this mark of principle, you are anticipating what makes up capitalism while crossing out castration. What is foreclosed in capitalism is this initial mark and what Marx tried to do was to reintroduce the notion of debt. When you propose to me a reactionary pole of investments and a revolutionary pole, I say that you are already taking the concepts of “revolutionary” and of `reactionary as already instituted in a field that does not permit an appreciation of what you are trying to say. You are using breaks [_coupure_], I will certainly admit that Oedipus and castration are _dépassé_, but capitalism… [_End of the session_]

# Lecture 2

>We have just seen the correlation between the notion of flux and five other notions: pole, code or accounting system, stage of transformation, sector and stock. If we try to simplify all of this, I think that the notion which I was attempting to launch last time may be able to concentrate or group together all of these five references, this notion being that of the break-flow. For this notion of the break-flow has to be understood simultaneously in two ways: it is to be understood as the very correlation of flux and code, and if, returning once more to capitalism, we are aware that flows are “accounted for”, it is in favour of a movement of decoding such that the accounting system has simply taken the place of codes; it is at this point that we come to realize that it’s no longer sufficient to speak of an accounting system, but rather of a financing system or structure.

As previously, this session begins in progress, and its brief length indicates that this only a fragment of a longer session. Deleuze starts by suggesting the need to define flows more clearly in order to render an initial system of concepts related to flows and their interruption as social investment of desire. Deleuze’s development yields additional concepts, in rates of transformation, sectors, and stocks, and he indicates that the utility of stocks varies with each case, and yet they maintain linkages through flows which yield movements of value between the poles (cf. _Anti-Oedipus_ ch. III, sections 9 & 10). Deleuze proposes to focus on the notion of break-flow, a notion emergiing both as a break-subtraction of flow and break-detachment of code, which Deleuze calls the mechanism of delirium in the double schizz operation. Deleuze suggests that the economic operation of coding flows entails the double break-flow operations, with capitalism’s formation as madness in its pure state, yet also the opposite of madness, at once producing decoded flows, and yet establishing itself on that which terrified all other social formations. Here lies the deep link between capitalism and schizophrenia, the decoding of flows, yet also capitalism’s harsh repression of madness for this very reason. Deleuze then shifts to a detailed historical presentation of this unfolding linkage, starting with Marx’s depiction of the Asiatic state, demonstrating the radical contingency of capital’s formation, its generalized decoding of flows yet also an apparatus for conjugating such flows. The session ends with an interruption as Deleuze, describing the merchant capitalists’ seizure of production by turning associations of producers into sub-contractors, follows Marx toward a second aspect of this movement, which is cut off.

(the lecture starts from here)

… I would like to pursue the problem of the economy of flows; last time, someone wanted a more precise definition of flows, more precise, that is, than something which flows upon the socius. What I call the socius is not society, but rather a particular social instance which plays the role of a full body. Every society presents itself as a socius or full body upon which all kinds of flows flow and are interrupted, and the social investment of desire is this basic operation of the break-flow to which we can easily give the name of schizz. It is not yet important for us to have a real definition of flows, but it is important, as a starting point, to have a nominal definition and this nominal definition must provide us with an initial system of concepts.

As a point of departure for our search for a nominal definition of flows, I’ll take a recent study by a specialist in the flows of political economy: _Flows and stocks_ by Daniel Antier.[[1]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-02-13/#_edn1) Stocks and flows are two primary notions in modern political economy, remarked upon by [J.M.] Keynes, such that we find in Keynesian economy the first great theory of flows in his _General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money_ [1936]. Antier informs us that, “from the economic point of view, we can call flows the values of the quantities of goods and services or money that are transmitted from one pole to another”; the first concept to be placed in relation with that of flows is that of pole: a flow, inasmuch as it flows on the socius, enters by one pole and exits by another.

At our last session, we had tried to show that flows implicated codes, in the sense that a flow could be called economic insofar as something passed, and where something else blocked it and made it pass; the example given was that of the rules of alliance in so-called primitive societies, where taboos represent a blockage of the flow of possible marriages; the first permitted marriages, i.e. the first permitted incests, called preferential unions, which are, in fact, hardly ever realized, represent something like the first modes of passage: something passes, something is blocked (this blockage taking the form of incest taboos), something passes, the preferential unions, something blocks it and makes it pass, for example the maternal [_utérine_] uncle. There is, in any case, the determination of an incoming and of an outgoing flow; the notion of a pole implicates or is implicated in the movement of flows, and this takes us back to the idea that something flows, that something is blocked, that something makes it flow, that something blocks the flow.

Antier continues: “In the knowledge that the term pole will be given to an individual or a firm, or alternately a group of individuals or group of firms, or even a fraction of a firm…” — Here are defined the interceptors of flows… when the operations carried out by these – “the interceptions of flows can be described by a coherent accounting system…” Thus, a correlative of the notion of flow is that of an accounting system; when the operation carried out – such as the passage of a flow from one pole to another – may be described by a coherent system, this evidently being expressed in terms of capitalism, by which I mean that in this context we are in the framework of capitalism at the level of abstract quantities, as the final residue of something that has an entirely different scope in pre-capitalist societies, to wit, what in pre-capitalist societies present themselves as veritable codes. It’s when a society is completely decoded that flows are prone to incorporation into an accounting system, that is, into an axiomatic of abstract quantities instead of referring to qualified codes; the accounting system under capitalism is the residue of quantities, abstracted from the coding of flows, and capitalism functions on the basis of decoded flows, from which point on these flows are taken up by a system based on accounting.

Antier continues: “…We can consider all goods arriving at the same level of material or legal transformation at the precise moment at which they arrive as constituting one and the same flow…” Here you have a third correlative notion: material or legal transformation, “and if one is speaking of flows that are exchanged between industrial sectors, one must specify the notion of sector, if one is interested in precisely determining the flow of production, the flow of revenues, the flow of consumption, then one has to determine these terms carefully; take for example the flow of monetary revenue reached by calculating the totals of all liquid assets…”

The question is, what is meant by ‘all liquid assets’ [_tous les biens en monnaie_]? This is what economists refer to as nominal salaries – a concept that covers real wages, as well as management salaries and dividends (interest on assets). Take for example the flow of cash revenues [_flux de revenus monétaires_]: this is determined by the total of all liquid assets at the disposal of all of the individuals making up the collectivity, where the revenue of a large number of individuals can be precisely evaluated since it is paid out by other individuals, such as state contractors, and since it has been precisely calculated; but for many kinds of revenue the importance of which must not be undervalued, one can’t give an exact definition; well, well, so there’s a sphere of indetermination in the sector?

This is doubtless related to something very profound in what is, as we shall see, the accounting sector; but, for all that, we now have a triple reference: the flows refer for one thing to poles and for another to codes or accounting systems, then – in fourfold fashion – to rates of transformation, next to sectors and finally to stocks. This amounts to five correlative notions. From an economic viewpoint we will refer to stocks of goods and monetary stocks, as the goods held and the money held by only one pole; the flow, then, is what flows from one pole to another, what goes in and what goes out, and the stock is what is brought back as the material and legal possession of one of the poles considered; this clearly shows the correlative character of the two notions.

We can thus define stocks in the following way: the utility of stocks changes from case to case, but is linked in one way or another, at one time or another, to the existence of flows — we will, nevertheless, receive the distinct impression that stocks and flows are effectively the same thing as they relate to two different units: first, the passage from one pole to the other, and secondly, attribution to one of the two poles, as two units of measure for one and the same thing. — The utility of stocks varies with every given case, but is linked in one way or another, and at one time or another, to the existence of flows; and yet, whereas flows allow one to extract the movements of values between different poles, stocks represent a sum of values that are at the disposal of a given pole; there are no goods related to a stock which are not, at a specified time, also correlated to a flow; this is, in fact, one of the fundamental principles of accounting, because the influx and output of a stock constitute flows; only the study of flows allows one to realize the role of the incoming and outgoing movements involved in stock variations.

So, we have just seen the correlation between the notion of flux and five other notions: pole, code or accounting system, stage of transformation, sector and stock. If we try to simplify all of this, I think that the notion which I was attempting to launch last time may be able to concentrate or group together all of these five references, this notion being that of the break-flow. For this notion of the break-flow has to be understood simultaneously in two ways: it is to be understood as the very correlation of flux and code, and if, returning once more to capitalism, we are aware that flows are “accounted for”, it is in favour of a movement of decoding such that the accounting system has simply taken the place of codes; it is at this point that we come to realize that it’s no longer sufficient to speak of an accounting system, but rather of a financing system or structure.

The strict correlation of flux and code implies, apparently, that in a society – and this is clearly our point of departure – it’s impossible to seize flows other than by and through the operation which codes them; the fact is that a non-coded flow is, strictly speaking, an unnamable or merely a thing. This is what I was getting at last time, this is the terror of society – it is the flood, the deluge which is the flow that breaks through the barriers of codes. Societies aren’t exactly in mortal dread because everything is coded – the family is coded, death is coded; but what makes societies panic is when something or other breaks down, something that forces the codes to crack. A flow is thus not recognizable as an economic and social flow except by and through the code which encodes it.

And this operation of coding implies two simultaneous interruptions, and it is this simultaneity which allows us to define the notion of a break-flow: simultaneously, in an operation of coding the flows, a subtraction [_prélèvement_] from the flows is produced, due to the code, and this subtraction from the flows defines its poles: it defines a certain entry point and a certain exit, and it is between the two that the break-subtraction takes place; this occurs at the same time as the code itself relates to a break of another sort which is strictly simultaneous, meaning once more that… there is no subtraction from a flow which is not accompanied by a detachment of or from the code which encodes this flow, although it is the simultaneity of the subtraction of the flow and the detachment of a segment of code that permits one to define the flow with reference to poles, sectors, rates and stocks. This notion of a break-flow presents itself in two-fold fashion, for it implies at once a break-subtraction of a flow and a break-detachment of a code. Here you’ve got the mechanism of delirium: it’s this double schizz operation — it’s the schizz which consists both in an operation of subtractions of flow as a function of detachments of code, and vice versa.[[2]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-02-13/#_edn2)

If, to begin, I take an indeterminate flow as a purely nominal starting point, then what flows on the socius, cannot appear socially speaking as a flow, except in correlation to a code, or at least to an accounting system, and the flow itself is qualified as a function of the code, and the correlation of the two is where you have a break-subtraction on this flow itself (as qualified by the code), at the same time as and in reaction to which you have a break-detachment of the code. A detachment of code is correlative to a subtraction of flow. This is simply a formal description.

At first glance, a madman is someone who passes on the unnamable, who carries decoded flows: “a god speaks to me, but it’s not your god”. The Greeks had a notion of the demon, they had gods and the gods were allotted, everything was very properly allocated, they had powers and spaces; in a way, they couldn’t move, they were sedentary, they had their territory and the demons carried out the coding. Religions are not to be understood from an ideological viewpoint, but at the level of their pertaining to a social code. Demons were above all powers which did not respect the codes. In _Oedipus_ there is a text which is badly translated, and which reads, “which demon has leapt the longest leap,” a text which frankly leaps beyond the limits, it had to do with unnamable powers, with excess, and it is not forcing things to translate this as “decoding”. Thus, a demon speaks in a certain way so that a madman receives decoded flows, and in turn emits decoded flows, such that it flows and escapes on all sides, messing up all the codes. Which is why in Oedipus’ case, it just won’t stick, because literally, Oedipus is a screwed-up code.

When something goes bad, you always have to go back up to a higher level to see where things start to go bad (cf. the USSR), and psychoanalysis goes bad, but why and how so? Derrida has seen very clearly in what way psychoanalysis, at least at the level of its first intentions, is opposed to the code; it is in fact a system of decoding, and this is why this affair just couldn’t help going bad.[[3]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-02-13/#_edn3) Because decoding means either to read a code, to penetrate the secret of a code, or else it means to decode in an absolute sense, i.e. to destroy the codes in order to make the flows flow freely; a major part of the project of psychoanalysis was intended as an absolute decoding of the flows of desire and not as a relative decoding, to make the walls of the code cave in, and to make the flows of desire run wild.

It is in this sense that psychoanalysis was very close to a desiring economy, and properly speaking, to desiring-machines, the producers of the flows of desire; and this is seen very clearly in Freud’s writings, such as _The Interpretation of Dreams_, where he says: what distinguishes my method from the method of the key of dreams? The major difference is that the key of dreams proposes a code of desire; Freud says that they have seen everything, but that they propose a systematic coding : this means that, that is the key of dreams; and from the perspective of a key of dreams, if one decodes the dream, one decodes it in a relative sense, i.e. one discovers the cipher of its code. Now Freud says that psychoanalysis has nothing to do with all of that, that it does not interpret. And Derrida, in his article on Freud in _Writing and_ _Difference_ shows this very well. It carries out an absolute decoding, rendering the codes as flows in the raw state, and thereby psychoanalysis is opposed to codes. It goes without saying that, at the same time, and from the outset, they are inventing a new code, that is, the oedipal code which is even more of a code than any other code; thus, the flows of desire pass into the oedipal code, or else, whatever the flow of desire, it is stuffed into the oedipal grid. At this stage, psychoanalysis proves less and less capable of understanding madness, for the madman is really the being of decoded flows.

And who has shown this in a most vital and convincing way if not [Samuel] Beckett, whose strange creatures spend their time decoding things, they make non-codable flows pass. Social processes can’t capture flows except in relation to codes which operate on them, and which are simultaneously a detachment of a flow and a subtraction of chains or codes, and the madman makes flows pass on it, flows from which it is no longer possible to detach anything; there are no more codes, there is a chain of decoded flows, but one can’t cut into it. There is a sort of deluge or failure of the body, maybe that’s it, after all, the body-without-organs, when on the body, or from the body flows enter and exit by way of poles, flows on which one can no longer carry out any subtraction because there are no longer any codes from which to detach anything.

The state of the body of someone who has undergone a fairly severe operation, the eyes of this patient are the eyes of someone who has not been very far from death, who has not been very far from madness, the eyes are elsewhere in a certain sense – he has gone through the wall. It is interesting that what we call convalescence is a kind of return. He’s had a brush with death, it is an experience of the body, very strange, psychoanalysis: why does Freud cling so strongly to the notion of a death instinct? He tells his secret in “Inhibition, Symptom and Anxiety.” [1926] It seems that if there is a death instinct, it’s because there is neither a model nor an experience of death. When pressed, he admits that there is a model of birth but not of death, thus, all the more reason to make of it a transcendent instinct. Bizarre. Perhaps the model of death could be something like the body-without-organs.[[4]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-02-13/#_edn4)

Horror-story writers have understood, after Edgar Allen Poe, that death wasn’t the model for schizophrenic catatonia, but that the contrary was true, and that the catatonic was the one who made of his body a body-without-organs, a decoded body, and that on such a body there is a kind of nullification of the organs.[[5]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-02-13/#_edn5) On this decoded body, flows can flow under conditions where they can no longer be decoded. This is why we fear decoded flows – the deluge; because once flows have been decoded, you can no longer subtract anything or break into them, no more than you can detach segments from any codes in order to dominate, orient or direct the flows.

And the experience of one who has been operated on, of her body-without-organs, is that, on this body, there are literally noncodable flows which constitute a thing, an unnamable thing. At the very moment that she breathes, there is great confusion of the flows that form one great indivisible flow, no longer susceptible to subtractions, one can no longer interrupt it. One long stream that cannot be tamed, where all of the flows that are usually distinguished by their codes are united in one and the same indivisible flow all flowing on one and the same non-differentiated body, the body without organs. And as for the mad patient who has undergone an operation, every breath of air he takes is at the same time a breath of spittle, a flow of air and spit that tend to get mixed up together, so that there are no longer any distinctions. Moreover, each time that he breathes and spits, he feels a vague desire to defecate, a vague erection: it’s the body-without-organs that escapes on every side. It is sad, but then again, it has moments of great joy, mixing up all the codes, it has its great moments, and this is what makes Beckett a comic writer.

Though here again, one can’t help saying, and then, and then, though this is what constitutes the madman and his place in society, as the place of one through whom all of the decoded flows pass, which is why he is perceived as the fundamental danger. The madman doesn’t decode in the sense that he would harbour a secret the meaning of which ordinary people have forgotten, but rather he decodes in the sense that he sits in his little corner and makes little machines which make the flows pass and which make social codes break down. The schizophrenic process as such, of which a schizo is only the schizophrenic continuation, well that schizophrenic process is a revolutionary potential in itself, in opposition to paranoid investments which are fundamentally of a fascist type.

This leads to a first result, namely, that the economic operation of coding flows involves a double break-flow, a break-detachment and a break-subtraction; and on the socius of a society one encounters these strange creatures, the mad, who make all of these decoded flows carry on. The strangest phenomenon of world history is the formation of capitalism because, in a certain sense, capitalism is madness in its pure state, and in another sense, it is likewise the opposite of madness. Capitalism is the only social formation which presupposes, as its condition of emergence, the breakdown of all preceding codes. In this sense, the flows of capitalism are decoded flows, and this poses the following problem: how could a society, with of all of its repressive formations, create itself on the basis of what constituted the terror of all other social formations: namely, the decoding of flows.

The intimate bond between capitalism and schizophrenia consists in their common basis and installation on decoded flows (insofar as they are decoded). How then was this decoding carried out? One has to keep the following two requirements clearly in mind: the basic affinity between schizophrenia and capitalism, but, at the same time, find in this basic affinity the reason for which the repression of madness under capitalism is conducted with much greater harshness and specificity than under pre-capitalist formations. In the one case there is a political economy and a libidinal economy, and, in the other, an economy of decoded flows.

I’d like to show that, historically, this shift took place over a long period of time: there are synchronic social machines and there are diachronic social machines; despotic Asiatic social machines are of a truly synchronic nature – Marx’s Asiatic state emerges in one blow, and all of the cogs and wheels of its state apparatus appear synchronically. The formation of the capitalist machine extends over many centuries. It’s a diachronic machine and has taken two long periods to come about; it isn’t capitalism that decodes the flows, rather, they are decoded on what we call the ruin and decline of great empires, and feudalism is only one of the forms of this ruin and decline. Capitalism does not proceed from the decoding of flows because it presupposes them, it presupposes flows that have lost their codes.

Marx is the author who has demonstrated the radical contingency of the formation of capital. Any history of philosophy is either theological, or else it is the history of contingencies and unforeseen encounters. The originary phenomenon of capitalism is this: decoded flows qua decoded flows must enter into conjunction. What then assures that this conjunction will take place? Here, one feels that history can teach us as much about the process of the decoding of flows, as about what ensures the conjunction of the decoded flows as such, and this can be nothing else than the processes of a specific historic sector. This tale of capitalism implies a generalized decoding of flows and at the same time something else, as if what ought to be put in place were an apparatus for conjugating decoded flows.

This is what gives capitalism its purely illusory appearance of liberalism. It has in fact never been liberal, it has always been state capitalism. This tale begins in Portugal in the 12th century, this tale of state capitalism. There has never been a time when flows were decoded and when everything was free, bringing recuperation, which is an awful thing. If it’s true that capitalism replaces the old ruined codes with conjugating machines, and axiomatic machines which are infinitely more cruel, crueler than the cruelest despot, although of another cruelty, it is at the same time as the decoding takes place [_que ça se décode_] that it is taken up by another machine which is a machine for conjugating decoded flows; whence capitalism’s affinity with schizophrenia, for it is based on decodings, and its opposition to schizophrenia, because instead of making the decoded flows pass, it blocks them in another way, and it makes them enter into a machine for conjugating decoded flows.

Take an example from the history of painting, the very bizarre history of the Venetian School: it is marked very late by the so-called Byzantine style, while Venice itself was already very advanced in mercantile capitalism, but this merchant and banking capitalism remained entirely nestled in the pores of the old despotic society. And all of Christianity at that time finds something like its pictorial form in these pyramidal structures, literally, in hierarchical mode, which respond to despotic overcoding. These Byzantine paintings of the Venetian school continue until the middle of the 15th century.[[6]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-02-13/#_edn6)

Here you have this beautiful Byzantine style, and what do you see? – overcoded Christianity, Christianity interpreted according to the style and the manner of overcoding: there is an old despot, there is the father, there’s Jesus and there are the tribes of the Apostles. In one of Delphiore’s paintings, there are rows of pyramids which are spread in fine rows facing straight ahead. It is not just the people who are coded and overcoded in Byzantine art, it is also their organs which are coded, coded and overcoded, under the great unifying influence of the despot, whether this despot is God or the father or whether he is the great Byzantine Emperor. We get the impression that their organs are the object of a collective hierarchic investment. It would be mad for a Virgin to be looking to the right while baby Jesus was looking the other way. You’ve got to be mad to invent something like that; you couldn’t do something like that under a regime where organs are collectively invested, are coded by the collectivity and are overcoded.

Under Christianity, the codes are mixed up, but this is because despotic codes coexist with territorial codes, and the colors themselves enter into the pictorial code. And if, in a museum, you change rooms, you will discover something else altogether, it is a great joy and a great anxiety too, for they are in the process of decoding the flows, a process which doesn’t coincide with the explosion of capitalism but comes quite a bit later. The great decoding of the flows of painting takes place around 1450, right in mid-15th century, and it’s a kind of radical break: all of a sudden we see the hierarchy of overcoding breaking down, the ruin of the territorial codes, the flows of painting go insane too, destroying all of the codes, a flow passes. We get the impression that painters – occupying their usual position amongst artists in relation to the social system – create Christs that are totally queer, they are totally mannerist Christs, it’s all sexualized, they create Virgins who stand in for all women, and baby boys who have just nursed, little boys pooping, they really play at this process of decoding flows of colour.

And how does this happen? Everything happens as if, for the first time, the characters represented became the owners of their own organs: the collective hierarchic codification of organs, the social investment of organs is done with; from now on the Virgin and every other character will, literally, start to run their own affair; in fact the painting escapes on all sides: the Virgin looks to one side, there are two guys looking at baby Jesus, a third is looking on as if something were happening, there are scenes in the background and the picture explodes in all directions so that every one starts possessing their own organs. They are not insane, there is one member of the Venetian School who makes a creation of the world that is incredible: generally the creation of the world ‘a la Byzantine’ was done according to a hierarchy; there was a kind of cone or big pyramid of the despotic order and at the very bottom, the territorial codes. The creation of the world that interests me is a departure from this: there is God the Father up in the sky in the position of a runner, and he gives a starting signal; in front of him are ducks and chickens who are racing away as fast as they can, and in the sea there are fish who are also racing away, and God is the one who sends it all away, it is the end of all the codes.

And what do they do with the body of Christ? The body of Christ is useful as a body without organs; so they machine it in every way and direction, they make it amorous, suffering, tortured, but you can feel that it is joyous. The perspective, you see, the perspective, that’s nothing, a useless trick; those who have done without it, it’s because they didn’t need it, they had other problems. Perspective is lines of flight and can only be useful in a painting of decoding, but it is very secondary, it doesn’t even count in the organization of a painting. So what are they trying to do, we’re going to cut low along Christ’s hip, we’re going to make a mannerist Christ, all the tortured bodies are good bodies without organs, Saint Sebastian with his arrows sticking out in all directions.

Once again, in this overthrowing of the pictorial system, perspective is only a little thing. The generalized decoding of flows has to be taken up again by something other than a code, and in effect, there is no longer a pictorial code, but instead a strange sort of pictorial machine that conjoins and that will give rise to the unity of the picture, no longer a signifying unity of a code or overcode, but a system of echoes, of repetitions, of oppositions, of symmetries, a veritable conjugating machine, where flows of colors and decoded features are conjugated. There emerges a real pictorial axiomatic that replaces the failing codes. Capitalism doesn’t arise by means of the simple decoding of flows, for it does not appear until such time as flows, inasmuch as they are decoded, enter into conjunction with one another.

Marx has said that when this happens it proves his great theory of contingency. In Rome, as at the end of feudalism, the decoding of flows brought in a new kind of slavery and not at all capitalism. For what had to take place was the meeting of the flow of decoded capital and that of deterritorialized labor. Why did this encounter take place? Refer to Marx’s notion of primitive accumulation, on one condition and that is that primitive accumulation, this can be a dangerous thing, if we say: oh yes, primitive accumulation, this is what served to fuel the process of accumulation, and we might as well say the formation of stocks at the beginning of capitalism. One has to see that primitive accumulation is called primitive to distinguish it from other types of accumulation, not primitive because it comes first.

The way capitalism functions, even if we are talking about its industrial essence, is the way banking and trading work, and we must hold that capitalism is essentially industrial, although it only functions through its banking system and through its trade circuits. Why? There is a kind of conjunction: capital starts to take control of production, but is it the first time? No. So, we take up Marx’s analysis again, an analysis which Marx insists on: the control of production by capital has existed in a certain guise from the beginning, but it appears in another guise with capitalism. I mean to say that even from the perspective of banking and mercantile capitalism, the banks and merchants create a monopoly for themselves: there is at the outset of capitalism, the way in which English mercantile capitalism forbids foreign capitalists from buying wool and woollen cloth; in that case, this exclusive clause is the means whereby the local merchant capitalists ensure that they control production because the producers can only sell through them.

So, we have to mark two times: a first time where merchant capitalists, in England for example, make the producers work for them by means of a system of delegation whereby the producer becomes a sort of sub-contractor, and this is where commercial capital directly takes possession of production; it is the great historic moment when merchant capital declared war on the leagues, i.e. the associations of producers. It’s a war between producers who looked with trepidation upon their being in the service of merchant capital, and merchant capital which, on the contrary, was trying to obtain greater and greater control of production via this sub-contracting method.

But it would take, as Marx declared, a second time … [_End of the session_]

# Lecture 3

>Our entire hypothesis is, on the contrary, that the social field is invested by a sexual libido as such and that this is even the fundamental activity of the libido: to feed these unconscious investments of desire of the social field. Why does this pass through the individual’s sexuality? Here, there’s a hypothesis that is crucial – and that does not correspond at all to the inverse rapport introduced by Freud – as the field of consciousness being entirely filled with preconscious investments of interest of the social field; underneath, the true libidinal investments of the social field… can manifest themselves only within the set of erotic sexual relations and within the conception that an individual and a group, or a group, make of sexuality itself.

Deleuze considers psychoanalysis as related to economics, predominantly material from chapters II and III. He begins with social investments of the unconscious, particularly as related to libidinal investments, a linkage disconnected by Freud, whereas for schizo-analysis, the libido’s primary function is to fuel the social field’s unconscious investments of desire, and schizo-analysis emphasizes rich-and-poor as apprehension of class struggle by unconscious desire, as a nonfamilial Other, thus rendering the family exterior to this process. Deleuze maintains that the traditional perspective is a race towards death, desire choked off, and the Oedipal framework focusing on the triangle father-mother-me, thereby creating an Oedipal-narcissist machine, eliding any fourth term (which would be the phallus, missing in place). Deleuze focuses on how Freud constructed this emphasis on familialism and toward the death drive, comparing this construction to how certain proponents of anti-psychiatry remain stuck in familialism, emphasizing the need to sever the linkage between desire and the family. Shifting to an economic perspective, Deleuze emphasizes the fundamental linkage between schizophrenia and the capitalist machine’s schizo mode of functioning, and he recalls the previous session’s discussion of the schizo’s channeling of decoded flows in contrast to the neurotic’s grounding within Oedipal recoding. Deleuze pursues an economic analysis of the two heterogeneous flows, constant capital and variable capital, as mechanisms of capitalism, leading to the distinction of money of exchange and credit money. After an unspecified question about economics, the truncated session ends with Deleuze raising additional distinctions about the types of money in banking circuit and the credit domain.

… What Toul [Prison]’s Dr. [Edith] Rose is doing goes further than denouncing an institution; it turns out she’s denouncing the authorities behind the institution. Hence why, like she can’t take anymore, she kind of breaks one of the system’s unwritten rules, i.e., that anything said to a psychiatrist never leaves the room. She goes over a lot of things—an epileptic locked and chained in solitary confinement for eight days—things newspapers had only glossed over. Denouncing the institution in general… The GIP [Prison Information Group] has been rallying support for Dr. Rose from psychiatrists and analysts.

There’s something I’d like to come back to. Last year, I tried to argue that social investments are what the libido is working with.[[1]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-03-11/#_edn1) So far as the libido is concerned, parents only figure in as either agents of production or agents of anti-production—they never come in at the level of the unconscious. The unconscious is ignorant of parents; the idea of an unconscious libidinal investment of the social field implies a clear distinction between investments of the social field we should think of as the preconscious investment of interests and a completely different type of investments: the unconscious investments of desire, or libidinal investments. Something that initially bothered me in Freud’s writings is the way in which he establishes a kind of inverse relationship between sexual investment and social investment. There are clear-cut moments in the Schreber case where Freud writes: you know, social investment implies a desexualization—the unfortunate concept of sublimation—And the social field as such is resexualized only in the case of regression. And that’s how he interprets the whole social aspect of Judge Schreber’s delirium, i.e., that it’s a regression undoing desexualization, the original sublimation. Our whole assumption, on the other hand, is that the social field is invested by a sexual libido as such, and that that’s actually the libido’s primary function: to fuel the social field’s unconscious investments of desire.

Where does individual sexuality come in? Here, there’s already an assumption—one that doesn’t line up with the inverse relationship Freud suggests: since the field of consciousness is entirely filled by the social field’s preconsciously invested interests—beneath the real libidinal investments of the social field, investments of desire that don’t necessarily coincide with the preconscious investments of interests—they can only manifest across erotic sexual relations and in the way individuals and groups conceptualize sexuality itself, i.e., that it [_missing_] mean just anything, taking Marx’s well-known expression literally, where the relationship between man and woman offers a way of measuring his [_sic_] relationship with his fellow man [_sic_]. In other words, unconscious libidinal investments in the social field only appear through the series of a person’s or group’s lovers, series of sexual relationships, and in that sense it’s really true that libidinal or sexual investment, through its erotic objects, invests an entire social field. And not for the sake of desexualization—it throws everything up in the air.[[2]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-03-11/#_edn2)

Yet, in concrete terms, in his writing, there’s something rather curious in Freud, completely in line with the bourgeois families he’s describing, and it has to do with the role of maids. Roughly speaking, this comes either from Freud himself or from one of his cases.[[3]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-03-11/#_edn3) The first basic feature: when he discovers the Oedipus complex, it’s in relation—he says so himself[[4]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-03-11/#_edn4)—it’s in relation to his own situation; it’s funny, when it comes to his childhood, folks always bring up his father and mother. Really, there are two key figures: a maid who gets accused of theft, and a half-brother who has the maid locked up, who has the maid “locked up,” as he puts it. So, there’s a link between this half-brother and the maid. That alone is enough to break down any pseudo-Oedipal structure because it turns out the half-brother goes to live in Manchester, and that’s the rich side of the family.

Right away, I’d like to point out how Freud, per his psychoanalytical custom, has always oedipalized that, i.e., projecting it [_rabattre_] onto daddy-mommy—meaning that he only ever depicts his half-brother as a stand-in for his father and the maid as representing his mother. That might well be—that’s not for me to say—but I think it was a tough decision for Freud, when he was discovering Oedipus, faced with a context where the libido obviously didn’t just fill in familial roles but social agents of projection or social agents of enunciation—the maid and the half-brother—that option was on the table, where the libido was an unconscious investment of the social field rooted in a childhood divide between Rich-Poor. A possible direction he was aware of—we’ll see—he represses it, he sublimates it for the sake of a wholly familial, oedipal interpretation. Freud’s arguments always, constantly allude to or even directly cast the theme of rich-and-poor in terms of unconscious libidinal investment—in the Rat Man, for example. In what he’s so beautifully written in “The Neurotic’s Individual Myth,” Lacan is the first to underscore how significant this theme was even in childhood, the choice between rich woman and poor woman in the case of the Rat Man, rooted in a running theme throughout the Rat Man’s case, i.e., this sort of circulating debt, a circulating debt which the Rat Man libidinally invests around the two poles of rich woman and poor woman.

In the Wolf man, the same sort of problem: the Wolf Man invests heavily in a maid he saw as a child washing the floor on her hands and knees, and this poor woman’s position gives rise to an incredibly powerful investment that has a part in determining his adult sexuality. What does Freud say? He waffles between two positions, but we can tell he’s already made up his mind—the first option is that the libido invests class determinations the child only apprehends empirically in the form of wealth-or-poverty. And what does the middle-class Wolf Man do, according to Freud? Having caught the maid on the floor, he develops a life-long habit of debasing women, as if all women belonged on the side of the poor woman. At once debasement and love. If we take that route—and we’re not used to hearing Freud speak this way—there’s only one way out: recognizing that libidinal or sexual investment, insofar as it is sexual, doesn’t invest familial determinations at all, but through family arrangements, invests social divides from one’s social field.

But that’s not what he wants, and in these passages, he tells us that the tendency to debase women and view every woman as a poor woman is only a rationalization. We can see when Freud moves in one direction, explores it for a bit and then no, he says, I was only trying to show how that was a dead end. He says that has nothing to do with the Wolf Man’s habit of debasing women because the child, he claims, identifies servants helping him as his mother insofar as they show him affection. We’re seeing the detours and doubts of a brilliant mind play out in real time: he almost goes one way and then ends up turning back. You know why the child invested his maid on all fours: it’s because—recalling the famous thesis affording him his bizarre oedipal reduction—because he had previously caught his mother in the same position. Not washing the floor, but in a sexual position with his father. Which means the fact that the woman scrubbing the floor is poor no longer matters; that rationalization comes second to the daddy-mommy investment—the only investment.

A third kind of passage—A bourgeois family in the 19th century, it’s easy to see why maids come up in Freud’s writing; what might he say about us today, when many families have their children looked after by Portuguese women, who have children of their own? My first question is whether the child, small as they are, confuses and identifies his mother—the poor Portuguese woman—with the bourgeois woman whose house she works in. I believe that, even if her baby tends to mix them up, that gets straightened out soon enough. And conversely, whether the child, small as they are, confuse the poor Portuguese woman washing the floor with their mother making love to their father.

I wonder if, from childhood, there aren’t properly unconscious and libidinal investments that aren’t at all directed at the family or family determinations, that only target the family coincidently, or where the parents are understood in relation to other social agents and aren’t confused with them, such that the libido, from early childhood, invests determinations from their social-historical field, and invests them—not as a Marxist thinker would, obviously, that only comes later, and at the level of the preconscious investments of interests—but invests them in the directly empirical form of: rich – poor. In other words, the rich and poor play, as Lacan might put it—though perhaps in a non-Lacanian way—they play the role of the other, the big Other, which is non-familial, which comes through in the structure of the family; they are extra-familial divisions in the social sphere; and that’s what the libido invests.

Third, in his writing, there’s this whole Freudian business with family romance.[[5]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-03-11/#_edn5) It’s always about maids, and with bourgeois families, it has to get framed that way. With the family romance, we again see Freud’s oscillation and the choice he makes. He only hesitates inasmuch as he’s already decided between his two options, has already opted for the puerile, familial understanding. Freud discovers the family romance in the context of neurosis, and the neurotic’s family romance is presented as a fiction whereby the neurotic fantasizes their origins in one way or another. Again, we find the libidinal theme of wealth and poverty—sometimes the subject’s fantasy about their origins takes the form, “I’m from a lesser background, I am not my mom’s son, I’m the maid’s son”; sometimes it takes the form, “I’m of superior descent, I am the son of a prince, Mom had me with a prince.”

A famous example of the first sort of fantasy, the turn toward lower origins, is what we find in Sophocles’ famous _Oedipus Rex_: recall the famous exchange between Oedipus and Jocasta where Oedipus says, “I absolutely have to know where I come from,” and Jocasta—who understands the Oedipus complex well enough to know it isn’t a problem—responds, “Don’t worry about it, why does it matter?” And he is already so oedipalized that he says, “You don’t care about your origins because you’re from a rich, lustrous family, while, as the son of a poor shepherd, from a poor family, I’ve had to make my own success.” It really makes for a family romance, and he turns on Jocasta, saying, “Well, if you don’t want to talk about where I really come from, it’s because you’re ashamed of it.” So, he fantasizes his origin: I’m the son of a poor family, I’m the servant’s son.

What happens in Freud’s case? At first, when he discovers the family romance, it isn’t linked to neurosis is general; it was more precisely related to paranoia, and he had to some extent grasped the fullness of a sexual investment of the social field _qua_ sexual investment. But that’s not what he wants; he’ll continue to stifle the possibility of that line of thinking, to the point that, when Reich brings it back up in a distorted form, he takes it badly, maintaining that the family romance is solely a defense against oedipal incest. That is, if the neurotic reconfigures their origins, it’s to escape the pressure of incestuous desire, so that again, when he’s on the verge of understanding the properly libidinal and sexual investments of the social field, he recants and falls back to the oedipal triangle, turning any social investments into merely preconscious derivatives of the only really libidinal investments, solely reserved for the incestuous oedipal familial arrangement.

This other theme, which Freud constantly muffles out, is always there, subsisting as a haunting reminder. What about the maid ultimately disturbed little Freud so much? I argue that if there’s a sexual investment of the social field, it happens at the level of childhood. It’s so important to Freud that it forms as an adult—ah, yes, any investment of the social field comes later—it’s because he wants for investments of the social field to not be libidinal, strictly speaking, but for them to presuppose a desexualization of the libido in order to maintain the libido’s narrow familial scope. But our whole hypothesis is that rich-and-poor, on the contrary, is really the sort of empirical apprehension of a class struggle as it’s invested, not by preconscious interests, but by unconscious desire: the child’s libidinal investment, insofar as it directly bears upon the social field, follows suit. Rich-and-poor is the Other in the sense of the nonfamilial, and there is, directly and immediately through the family—I believe children don’t have any familial investments, it’s laughable—on the contrary, through family determinations, family determinations playing an inciting rather than an organizing role, we find a different, non-familial, investment, along the lines of rich and poor; it’s in this sense that class struggle involves more than simply preconscious investments (although it plays a rather decisive role in preconscious investments); it goes through the ordeal of desire, and does so from childhood. It’s easy to see how what plays out next is the kind of fanatic oedipalization carried out by psychoanalysis. Everything proceeds as though even child sexuality opened onto a social historical field, investing it in its childish or unconscious way. What it invests in such a field based on major rich/poor divides that thereby determine an exteriority regarding the family. The family is divided and split by these cuts; it’s not that such cuts are determined by the family. What these divisions are, are veritable schizzes.

From the start, what’s invested is a transfinite set, the transfinite set of the social field—it isn’t a closed set by any stretch; it’s a transfinite set with divisions, and divisions of divisions. You cannot close it; it’s a kind of open set. This transfinite set of the social field includes machines, agents of production, agents of anti-production, and all that gets invested by the sexual libido. And what we look for in the succession of our later lovers—assuming we’re looking for something from our childhood—is certainly not some family nonsense but something more profound, namely familial investments of the non-familial from our childhood.

When psychoanalysts are shameful enough to claim that the worries of a child or woman going in for analysis—Why do they go in for psychoanalysis? The typical response is that it has something to do with the phallus. In Freudian terms, famously, a woman’s basic motivation for seeking analysis is her penis envy, and the same goes for children because, being the phallus without having one, they’re in a conflicting situation. It’s an oedipal reinterpretation. But it’s more than obvious that—to put it moralistically—taking up the position of being a woman or the position of being a child in our capitalist society is really impossible; and if it’s impossible, then, it takes unusual means to get out of it. Why? It’s certainly not “phallus or no phallus,” we’re missing something, namely that what makes it impossible for a child to assume their situation as a child is their economic dependence, both politically and libidinally. For a woman, it’s her economic dependence, which prevents or compromises investments of the social field. Yet it’s necessary, when socio-libidinal investments are blocked off by veritable impasses set up by said social field, it’s necessary that things come back to the familial field where the child or woman finds themselves totally imprisoned, tied down, and as a result, they may very well be sympathetic to the idea that _there_ [in the family] lies the root of your troubles—and that isn’t the source of their worries at all; on the contrary, it’s a symptom and way of sidestepping the issue. That’s still the best way of repressing things.

The best means of repression: if you want to stifle social investments at the level of the unconscious and the libido, because that is something, there’s already the investment of the social field by preconscious interests; there’s already a whole system of repression at work when it comes to revolutionary or class interests, but with the unconscious libidinal investments of the same social field, taking place in a whole other mode, they don’t just need to be repressed; they need to be driven back. They’re just as shaped by society and by social determinations; they create real impasses in the social field that take desire back to the familial domain… You can see how it works: starting with a transfinite set invested by the libido, the social field is sexually invested by the libido. It’s not a coincidence that the characters in the family romance are always presented as connected to, or as having been derived from historical characters. It’s like the family romance says: yes, Genghis Khan is my real father, Catherine de Medici is my real mother, or the maid is the proletarian. That’s exactly the way in which, by way of some stimulus or other from the family, child sexuality starts to search for suitable divides in the social field and what it might invest therein.

It’s a transfinite set. Regardless how we describe what Oedipus does, whether we call it symbolic, imaginary, etc.—it’s always an act of reflection [_rabattement_], in a mathematician’s sense of the term. Which is when you project or rotate [_rabattre_] a starting set onto a target set, only the starting set is the social field invested by the libido, a transfinite set, [and] the target set is a finite set, the familial set. You go through this reflection or projection [_rabattement_], unseen and unknown, desire is trapped, sort of like, “Hey, this is what you wanted, buddy.” The part psychoanalysis plays is encouraging or, through its own means, carrying out this reflection—which it certainly didn’t invent, but for which it has found new methods.

This reflection is basically a race towards death. The familial target set everything gets projected onto is finite. 4, 3, 2, 1 0—the more it narrows in, the better, until desire is completely choked off and the only desire left is what gets psychoanalyzed. Tragic. 4, 3, 2, 1… _Four_—indeed, we’re told that in order for there to be an Oedipus, there must be a fourth term, as a prerequisite for its triangulation: this fourth term is famously missing: the phallus, missing in place, etc. The prerequisite for Oedipus is that its fourth term is always missing in place. Traditionally, there are three terms in the oedipal arrangement—they say there’s father, mother, and me. I’ll let you in on a secret. Narcissus, narcissism, comes _after_ Oedipus, not before. The oedipal machine is an oedipal-narcissist machine; they were wrong to place Oedipus before—a fatal error. It’s a set-up of three, and then the entire social domain, with all its investments, is reflected onto it. That’s what desire gets reduced down to while it was beginning to conduct a fantastic experiment, a machinic experiment—humanity’s greatest activity: machining things. _Three_, Oedipus enters the scene; the fourth term was necessary for setting things up, then it wanders around the other three, it won’t stand on its own—the notorious phallus in relation to which all three positions get defined.

The motivation (save for those who have already gone through their first analysis) is always economic, i.e., a subject’s dependence, and not their dependence on daddy and mommy. That money matters are so embedded in psychoanalysis; it isn’t the first time that monetarization is hidden behind means of payment. If, for psychoanalysis, monetary relationships are so embedded in the patient/doctor relationship, and if gets justified under the silliest, most laughable pretexts, it’s because such internalization has the advantage of hiding something, namely the basic economic dependence defining [the patient’s] motivation to get analyzed. None of us see how, as such, women and children—I can’t see how a woman, _as_ woman, could possibly assume her role as a woman in such a society. Even less so for children. From the perspective of desire, it’s impossible, and again, it’s not because of any penis-envy. As soon as the oedipal machine starts to function, it gets reduced again; it’s down to only two.

There are actually several possible outcomes; the oedipal machine can work in three different ways, depending on which of the three terms is excluded. First, father and mother join forces to dump the child. The first function of the oedipal machine, the giant grinder, is something we find all over part of Oedipus: the primitive scene, parental coitus, the child’s castration—father and mother join forces to maintain order, a secret order.

The second outcome is when it’s the child who gets rid of the father in order to join up with the mother. The incestuous side of things, the other aspect of Oedipus. Third: the mother joins forces with one or the other to suppress the third—the terrible mother, the so-called pre-oedipal mother, who is absolutely integral to Oedipus. Now, with only two terms left, another effort to get to its sought-after result, the death of desire. Already, when desire learns that what it desires above all is really to kill one’s father, to love one’s mother, it finds itself in a small territoriality, its private life, its tiny little secret—only two terms is still too many, which leads to the oedipal machine’s third phase. Here there’s only one term left, and it’s narcissism. It’s pretty obvious that narcissism is the result of the oedipal machine and not the other way around. And big Narcissus is still too much; the outcome of this race toward death is zero, and zero is what Freud, out of psychoanalysis, labels as “the death drive.” Desire can no longer be anything other than a desire for abolition—sadness.

Here’s where I claim schizo-analysis is the opposite; where do we find this kind of infinite reduction? It’s what I find so striking in recent books written by certain analysts, who go so far as to say, ([Serge] Leclaire) there’s a sort of radical decentering of analysis today, i.e., where you don’t even need to refer to the familial scene anymore, the psychoanalytic scene stands on its own; it’s never been better said: psychoanalysis has become axiomatic, _verum index sui_, i.e., the psychoanalytic scene no longer needs external references, even the family is too extrinsic; it draws on its own internal references, it props itself up—the real proving ground is now the couch. The zero term approaches; after leaving the couch, there’s abolition.

Let’s picture a schizo-analytic process. It should absolutely regroup this field, i.e., in practice, in terms of individual analyses, [it should] denounce the death drive, i.e., its practice should combat the extreme lengths the oedipal machine takes to bring us to zero, and then shatter its familial prison at the level of investments and recover its opening—and this is what makes it schizo-analysis—bringing the subject to delusions about their social historical field instead of bringing them to neurosis about daddy-mommy. Whereby it ought to be thought of as a militant analysis since, again, class struggle doesn’t simply take place at the level of preconscious interests; it moves to the level of the libidinal investments of the unconscious. To use a proposition as classical as Freud’s, the libido invests the social field only inasmuch as it is desexualized (see the ego and the id and the Schreber case). I see that as just a way of telling us: desire has nothing to do with the social field; the domain of desire _qua_ unconscious desire is Oedipus. Which is why schizo-analysis’s basic proposition is, on the contrary, that libidinal investment as such concerns the social field and, as such, doesn’t entail any desexualization. And an individual’s sexual relations or a group’s sexual relations are only exponents of such investments by unconscious desire of the social historical field.

We should revisit what Freud says about maids. Last year, I said: acknowledged or not, explicit or latent, all this familialism driving psychoanalysis is rather serious because, once desire has been oedipalized, the only freedom desire enjoys takes the form of a death drive. What I mean is that once we’ve oedipalized life—as Nietzsche might put it—one can only find the essence of life in the guise of life turned against itself, as death. And again, it’s not that any desire from one’s social field only appears in adulthood—that wouldn’t make sense because it would be like saying, okay, child sexuality has to be desexualized in order to invest the social field; it’s that way even in childhood. Before, the patient wasn’t anchored in the family; that was a 19th century development in psychiatry, a bourgeois idea, as Foucault demonstrated. And he’s absolutely correct in saying that psychoanalysis—through completely new means—isn’t opposed to 19th century psychiatry; it pulls off what 19th century psychiatry had started and failed to achieve, since the latter didn’t have the powerful family tool, the couch. It had the asylum. Freud finished what Pinel started. You have to see where the cuts are made.

What I can’t help but notice is how even the most leftist takes—no matter how daring, even the folks who are anti-psychiatry—come up short because they don’t get past this damned familialism. [R.D.] Laing sees the danger; his account of schizophrenogenic families is a lot of fun.[[6]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-03-11/#_edn6) See Laing and [Aaron] Esterson’s _Sanity, Madness, and the Family[**[7]**](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-03-11/#_edn7)_ — they analyze families and attempt to show what makes a family schizophrenogenic. They first begin with a schizo and work up to the family. They set the scene for us and then, when we look at what they describe as a schizophrenogenic family, the big twist is that it’s actually a typical oedipal family. What they call a schizophrenogenic factor is an organizing determination of the family: the famous double bind, i.e., sending contradictory signals where the subject supposedly goes crazy, caught in a double impasse. For a characteristic example, see the book written by one of Laing’s patients, who was miraculously cured[[8]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-03-11/#_edn8)—she was painting with her excrement. In group discussions, some patients argued to let her do it, others didn’t because it wasn’t clean. One day Laing, looking at one of her scatological paintings, said, “Not bad, but it needs color.” The woman starts to add color and then becomes a painter—she offers an account of her life, a description of her family.

But what family doesn’t constantly put out double binds? What father doesn’t take his kid with one hand and say, “I’m your best friend,” and at the same time, with the other hand, “You’ll get a smack if you act up.” That’s exactly what the double bind is, and the joke’s on all of us if that’s what we’re calling schizophrenogenic. [Gregory] Bateson’s whole deal is how the neurotic is determined by the oedipal family. In _The Self and Others,_ Laing says at the end that the schizo is someone who has fundamentally—he proposes the two concepts of infirmation and confirmation—who has been infirmed, or who has only gotten a false confirmation à la the double bind. This etiology of schizophrenia is still familialist and ultimately brings things back to a neurotic framework: the so-called schizophrenogenic factor is a factor normally attributed to Oedipus, and it’s back to business as usual, still oedipalizing things. But when we’re dealing with a schizo, we’re sure they have family problems, but it’s somewhere else, they’re from another world, so much so that they’ll agree, “Sure, fine, my father, my mother…” [because] they’re fed up, they’re tired. They hear voices, and these voices aren’t daddy-and-mommy; it’s their social-historical field.

It seems to me that neither anti-psychiatry nor institutional psychiatry get out of this familialism, but I argue that the study of schizophrenia can only begin to understand its object if we sever this pseudo-relationship between desire and family.

I’m told that I’m being totally unfair to Leclaire; I claim that isn’t my intent whatsoever. What stands out to me in S[erge] Leclaire’s work is how there are two poles: one pole is completely oriented toward overcoming Oedipus and the other leans toward making psychoanalysis into a sort of internal axiomatics, and I don’t know how he’s able to reconcile these two directions.[[9]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-03-11/#_edn9)

Moving over to the economic side of things, my whole basic assumption is that there’s a major affinity between the capitalist machine and schizophrenia. In other words, the functioning of capitalism is sort of a schizo way of functioning. But, but, but the hypothesis I’d like to work toward is that they are, at the same time, perfectly similar—the processes of capitalism and schizophrenia ought to be evaluated economically and not at all ideologically; the affinity between the capitalist machine and the schizophrenic machine breaks out at the level of economic activity—and at the same time, they are completely different, because… the affinity between the capitalist and schizophrenic processes is due to the identity in their nature, but their difference is owing to the fact that there’s an essential difference in their regimes. Identity of nature, difference of regime—that’s where we’re aiming. Last time, we started with the idea that the identity in their nature is as follows: if the schizo is someone who emits and channels decoded flows, who decodes every flow—which is why he doesn’t get caught up in Oedipus, because Oedipus is a recoding [_recodage_]—the neurotic is someone who avoids schizophrenia thanks to a recoding, only this recoding can’t be an ordinary (social) recording; it’s an Oedipal recoding.

Capitalism, historically, has been constituted on the basis of decoded flows, and it’s the decoding of flows which has made capitalism possible as such. Its existence doesn’t come down to decoding flows, because flows can be decoded without making and forming a capitalist machine, as is clear with Ancient Rome, with feudalism—capitalism comes to be when a conjugation of decoded flows is established, when decoded flows as such enter a determinable relationship.

In the pre-capitalist social field, it’s decoded all over, literally, it escapes as a series of independent leaks [_fuites_], and we’ve seen how capitalism emerges when two decoded flows form a conjugation, namely, the decoded flow of money and the deterritorialized flow of labor. And when the money-owner—money which will turn into capital via this conjugation, this encounter—and the deterritorialized, possessing only the force of their labor, come face to face in the market. And we can only make sense of this development if we recognize how this double decoding entails two completely independent series—which is why their encounter might not have happened, why we find decoding at a certain point in Roman history without their conjugation taking place—it’s radically contingent.

But what form does this encounter take? The money-owner—with all the historical circumstances we’ve seen—once it was in their interest to sell their land and once it was in their interest to invest their money in industry, well, private owners of decoded money will purchase the labor of deterritorialized workers. And in the process, it appears that capital truly becomes—insofar as capital buys labor—industrial capital. There was capital before, but not in a capitalist sense; there was merchant’s (commercial) capital and bank capital, but—to borrow Marx’s wonderful turn of phrase—it only functioned in the pores of the old formation. What does that mean? Literally, that means it functioned as alliance capital, allied with prior pre-capitalist societies, be they feudal or despotic.

The Chinese empire, for example: there is fully merchant capital, fully bank capital, which works in alliance, with everything that entails such as surveillance, with everything that entails such as state power, the great despot—it functions as capital in alliance with previous pre-capitalist society. After the encounter between both series of decoded flows, which will be constitutive of industrial capital, the capital which will become industrial capital undergoes a sort of mutation, a mutation whereby alliance capital is transformed into what we might call filiation capital. This transformation is well-described in a great passage from _Capital_, the section of _Book I_ titled, “The General Formula for Capital,” where Marx writes, “[value] suddenly presents itself as an independent substance, endowed with a motion of its own […] in which money and commodities are mere forms which it assumes and casts off”—that is, as merchant capital and bank capital, commodities and money now fall under this new form. “Nay, more: instead of simply representing the relations of commodities, it enters now, so to say, into private relations with itself. It differentiates itself as original value from itself as surplus-value,” in the same way that, in his person, God differentiates himself from himself as Father and Son. There’s no better way of describing how capital becomes filial capital. Thus, it’s the work of surplus value, which itself depends on the conjunction of both decoded flows, the flow of money and the flow of labor, which turns capital into industrial filial capital. But what is the formula for this filial capital? If you like, we might represent it as _x + ax_. It’s the form whereby money becomes capital, and money becomes capital to the extent that money engages in what Marx calls expansion [_bourgeonnement_] that is, to the extent that money produces money. An ineffable mystery: how money can produce money. _X + ax_, “_ax_” here referring to surplus value, i.e., the form whereby money makes money—that’s the “_+ ax_.” Where does this surplus value come from? We know that, according to Marx, it comes precisely from this encounter, this conjugation between whoever owns the flow of money and whoever owns the flow of labor, because the latter sells their labor.

From there, there are basically two patterns: an arithmetical pattern that might be expressed as _A’ – A = surplus value_, where surplus value is understood as an arithmetical difference. That’s the tendency in all of Marx’s writing; he says the one buying labor does so in the form of paying wages. These wages correspond to what it takes to maintain and renew the worker’s labor force. Let’s say it’s 6 hours—so, 6 hours = what’s needed for the maintenance and reproduction of the labor force. But when he buys the labor, he hasn’t bought 6 hours, even if he pays by the hour; he’s bought a day’s worth of labor, let’s say 12 hours. Therefore, there’s a difference between what the buyer gets from labor (by making them work for 12 hours) and what he pays for it, which is for 6 hours—hence the formula for surplus value is _A’ – A,_ an arithmetical difference. Obviously anti-Marxist economists are working on a similar basis, which isn’t a Marxist idea. Yet, in the same passages, he says something quite different. He tells us that there’s a difference between labor power with respect to its exchange value and labor power with respect to its use value.

At these points of the text, the difference is no longer arithmetical because the difference between considering something in terms of its exchange value and considering the same thing in terms of its use value comes down to a quantitative [_sic_] difference. Indeed, he says, wages paid by the owner of money-capital represent the exchange value of labor power, while the labor supplied by the owner of labor power itself has to do with use value. As a result, it’s no longer an arithmetical difference, but a qualitative one. At which point, the formula for surplus value is no longer _A’ – A,_ i.e., 12 – 6 = 6 surplus value, but is _Æy / Æx_, where _Æy_ is the fluctuation at a given moment in the flow of capital possessed by the money-capital owner, and _Æx_ the fluctuation in the flow of labor possessed by the owner of labor power. In other words, it’s no longer an arithmetical difference; it conforms to the difference in nature between the two flows. It’s a differential relationship. This second formula, _Æy_ / _Æx,_ has the upper hand, and we’ll see right away where this _Æx_ just now comes from: it’s precisely because _Æx_ and _Æy_ are the elements of a differential relationship that _Æx_ is produced by adding it to _x_. There, the variation whereby the filiative form of capital produces _Æx_ provides the nature of the differential relationship _Æy_ / _Æx_. We have to try to understand what this differential relationship is, and perhaps the entire capitalist economy hinges on such a relationship, and it does, but that remains to be verified.

And here my hypothesis bears out, namely, my assumption that capitalism either never runs on codes, or else, any codes are there for fun. It’s the first social regime that doesn’t use codes, and in that sense it’s very close to schizophrenia. But in another way, they aren’t close, because [capitalism] has come upon a wonderful trick: in place of failing and absent codes, it’s swapped in an axiomatic, an axiomatic machine a thousand times crueler, more cynical, more terrifying than the code of the great despot. More than anything, an axiomatic implies that—perhaps for the first time—capitalism presents itself as a society determining a field of immanence, and it forms the conjugation of decoded flows therein. The axiomatics of flows forms a field of immanence which capitalism will fill in with its own content, whereas before, there was always a relationship between the social field and codes invoking ideologically transcendent determinations.

What do we make of this qualitative difference? We can no longer get away with calling them two heterogeneous flows, especially since we no longer have codes qualifying these flows; we’ve gone beyond such a simple perspective now that we’ve seen how these two qualitatively distinct flows are caught up in a very particular sort of relationship, a differential relationship, just like how in differential calculus you have the relationship of the differential of the abscissa and the differential of the ordinate. If it’s true that both flows concerned are the flow of money capital convertible into means of production, of which part, if you like, is convertible into constant capital, and the other part into the purchase of labor power, i.e., into variable capital. [If that’s true,] the two flows are heterogeneous, but they’re like two parts of capital: constant capital, variable capital. From there, there’s no doubt that the qualitative duality of these flows must show up again in money, and that moreover, the mechanism of money brings us to the type of relationship that exists between the two.

The nature of their differential relationship is such that the two quantities [_grandeurs_], understood as heterogeneous, qualitatively distinct, are not of the same power [_puissance_]. One of the two must be a power, with the other a mere quantity. We should get a handle on the nature of both flows and how they’re related to money. I’d like to propose the following principle: in essence, money sort of plays out on two tables, and the coexistence of these two tables will form the most general basis for the mechanisms of capitalism. I’m relying on two current economists: Suzanne de Brunhoff[[10]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-03-11/#_edn10) and then a neo-capitalist economist whose theory is unwittingly completely schizophrenic, so much so that we might ask what difference there is between a text of scientific ambition in economics and a schizophrenic text when it comes to the mechanisms of capitalism. This economist, who is so spirited, so talented, is Bernard Schmitt, and I’ll refer to his book, _Money, Wages, and Profit_ [_Paris: PUF, 1966_].[[11]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-03-11/#_edn11)

Now, phenomenologically speaking—which is the only thing I’m concerned with, at the moment—Suzanne de Brunhoff, a Marxist, and the other one, who certainly isn’t Marxist, both say exactly the same thing. Basically: there are two forms of money, which lead to two different consequences. The Marxist’s takeaway is that the mechanisms of capitalism can only function by establishing a fictitious convertibility, more specifically, between both kinds of money. This convertibility is completely fictitious—it depends on the gold standard, it depends on the unity of markets, it depends on interest rates. In fact, it isn’t meant to function; according to Suzanne de Brunhoff, it’s meant to conceal the working of capitalism. This fictitious, hypothetical, constant convertibility from one form of money to the other ensures that how it works remains hidden. What I find interesting about this concept of concealment is that, where Brunhoff’s analysis is concerned, it’s no longer an ideological concept but an operational, organizational concept. That is, the capitalist monetary circuit can only function on the basis of an objective concealment, which comes down to the convertibility of one form of money to another.

What Schmitt has to say comes down to the same thing: he fully acknowledges both forms of money and attempts to define them. One, he says, is a pure creative flow—you can already sense how the basic phenomenon in capitalism is what every banker recognizes as the creation of money, a creative flow in the form of the creation of money. The other, completely different form is revenue-money, i.e., money defined as purchasing power. What’s so devious about Schmitt’s argument is how he says, look, what creates purchasing power is the transformation of the first form of money, the flow creating money, into the second form, revenue-money; purchasing power does not predate the form of revenue-money. That could be—why not? In fact, there is a form of money, creation of money, mutant power—monetarization famously transforming an economy by creating money. Central banks play a determining role here, creating money. There’s another form, revenue-money, purchasing power. What creates purchasing power is revenue-money and mutations in the flow of creating revenue-money; purchasing power doesn’t exist beforehand. One immediate consequence: the worker hasn’t been bought; there can’t be theft, there is no surplus value. Schmitt says that Marx was wrong, that, for there to be surplus value, it’s necessary that the worker’s labor power be bought, but it can’t be through wage-income because purchasing power is created by income; income cannot presuppose it. Therefore, he says, wages are not a form of purchase; it’s a form of mutating one money into another.

At this level, Brunhoff and Schmitt say more or less the same thing: in both cases, there are two irreducible forms of money, there’s a passage or mutation from one form to the other, and that’s the only way a capitalist system can function. On a purely descriptive level, it’s all too obvious that the money flowing through a firm or from a bank are signs of capital’s power, or if you like, it’s a force prospective in nature, which, strictly speaking—save for when the firm declares bankruptcy—at that point passes from one form of money to the other, signs of economic power which cannot be actualized here and now since, in effect, they imply an entire system of relationships between differential coefficients, involving other firms, finance banks, etc.

So, on the one hand, you have a system of signs of economic power, of unrealizable prospective forces, a detachment-cut in a system of capitalism’s monetary signs, and broadly speaking, we’ll file these signs of economic power away under the general heading of the structure of finance. It’s the whole structure of finance that goes through a company, connecting it to banks, going to other companies, connected to other banks.

As for employees, what they receive, the money they’re working with doesn’t have to do with signs of economic power that can’t be realized here and now, with a prospective value, but with signs of exchange value that don’t represent a financial structure but a means of payment, i.e., payment for their labor, payment they’ll actualize by buying goods. This system of means of payment and exchange values is convertible into goods and into use-values, and it [_missing,_ enters] into a sort of one-to-one relationship with an imposed range of products, suggested by the market. They have their means of payment; they acquire certain types of suggested goods. This time it’s not as a detachment-cut [_coupure-détachement_] into a set of signs of economic power; they’re withdrawal-cuts [_coupures-prélévements_] on a series of products, the appropriation of which depends on my possessing a number of means of payment.

I’m just trying to mark out concrete domains. Money has two distinct, fundamental aspects that confirm our initial assumption: _Æy_ and _Æx_ refer to quantities which evidently don’t have the same power [_puissance_], i.e., the money that goes in and out of a company is not at all the same as the money going in and out of the employee’s pocket. And again, once we pretend that the two are interchangeable, they _are_, effectively—and that’s what’s funny about it, because it doesn’t matter, since that doesn’t change anything about their difference in nature. By no means do they have the same capacity [_puissances_]. One is really a sign of economic power, while the other is nothing of the sort—strictly speaking, it’s the sign of the employee’s powerlessness. One defines a financial structure; the other defines a series of payment methods—but that isn’t the same thing at all, and that at least confirms our initial assumption, namely, that it was necessary for at least one of the two quantities [_grandeurs_] to be an incommensurable power unrelated to the other, the other being quantity [_grandeur_] pure and simple. As a result, when we try to use one to measure the other, it’s like trying to use centimeters to measure astronomical distances. It’s an aspect of money that functions in a completely different way.

There are two things I’d add. This same duality, if we try to define it in more precise terms, the first idea that comes to mind is that means of payment are more or less what we call the money of exchange, and the other, the making of money, would refer to so-called credit money.

But it turns out that won’t do, and we can take this relationship even deeper: we actually find these two forms within credit money. How so? The distinction made between bank credit and commercial credit—commercial credit refers to phenomena of circulation, so-called simple circulation. For example: bills of exchange with a fixed maturity are credit money acting as payment money. The nature of bank credit is completely different; it implies a particular sort of circulation which is completely unrelated to the circulation of commodities. It implies a special circuit, the circulation of drafts, throughout which credit gains and loses its exchange value.

Thus, it’s not just in the overall dualism between exchange-money/credit-money—more specifically, we find it there in credit money as such, in the dualism between commercial credit and bank credit: the dualism between payment and financing. In the end, the two flows we started with, the flow of money-capital and the flow of labor, have been transformed by the differential relationship between two very different flows of money: the flow of money as financial structure and the flow of money as means of payment. Which puts us in a position to amend something I said earlier, which turns out to be false, that we only get capitalism as such with industrial capitalism. Yes and no. I mean, it’s true that capitalism as such can only emerge in the form of commercial or banking capital—which always colludes with, or would have always colluded with, other forms of society—were it not for industrial capital, but we ought to add that, sure, capitalism is fundamentally industrial, but it functions solely as commercial and banking capital, which has its sights set on industrial production. And there, then, such commercial and banking capital is no longer allied with pre-capitalist society. It finds its true ally, its alliance with industrial capital itself, an alliance which entails all sorts of violence, all the pressure and power that banking capital exerts over the very organization of production.

I’ve given two approximations of the regions where this form of money appears: one is the distinction between money in a bank-business circuit and the other form of money as means of payment, i.e., what goes in and out of an employee’s pocket. The second was the distinction between two domains of credit money: commercial credit and bank credit. It would be interesting to add other domains where this distinction is borne out; we’d have to demonstrate how the bank has power over both forms of money, i.e., how it issues payments and how it works out finance structures, and how that corresponds to banking activities that are theoretically convertible but which are, in reality, distinct.

# Lecture 4

- **The concept of desiring machines**: Deleuze explains how desire is not a lack or a fantasy, but a productive and creative force that operates at the molecular level, in relation to social and technical machines. He also discusses how desiring machines invest the social field in two ways: either by subordinating themselves to molar aggregates and repressive apparatuses (paranoia), or by escaping along lines of flight and deterritorialization (schizophrenia).
- **The tasks of schizo-analysis**: Deleuze outlines the three main tasks of schizo-analysis, which are: 1) to destroy the pseudo-formations of the unconscious, such as Oedipus, dreams, and fantasies; 2) to reach the desiring machines of the unconscious, which are molecular formations that function and produce; 3) to uncover the nature of the social investments of the unconscious, which are either paranoid or schizophrenic.

>Where things get tricky—I suppose—in schizo-analysis, is finding someone’s desiring machines. What’s the deal with your things, what are your machines? Then, if the person doesn’t answer in terms of machines, or if we can’t manage to find their machinic elements… obviously, that raises the question: what is our criterion? What allows us to say, ah, _there_, we’ve pinned down someone’s desiring machines? I think there are very solid criteria, and they specifically come down to this: desiring machines are molecular formations, never molar aggregates.

*This extremely fragmentary session consists mainly of two responses by Deleuze to student questions and also of Deleuze’s reiteration of the three tasks of schizo-analysis. The first question concerns the axes of code and axiomatics proposed by Deleuze, then desire’s investment of the social field, and also the investment of the social field by desiring machines. While the first positive task of schizo-analysis is to reach the lines of flight of the unconscious, he recognizes that all investments are necessarily molar or social. Hence the second task, discovering how social investments function at the level of the unconscious, and he notes that this usually requires recognizing how desiring machines are repressed by molar apparatuses of the State or the family. Another question concerns the Schreber case, whether the social investment takes several generations for the paranoiacs to be established. Deleuze points to several approaches (anti-psychiatry; Lacan) toward this aspect, and he considers such chicken-or-egg questions difficult but necessary, yet provided one avoids the indefinite familial reduction. Deleuze manages to express a certain hope that rather than ultimately reterritorializing on artificial land, the movement of deterritorialization might create a new earth. The session ends with Deleuze disagreeing with a student’s Lacanian emphasis who insists that the generational question is relevant, to be pursued the following week.*

Richard Pinhas: One thing I’d like to bring up—not that I’m necessarily arguing against it—earlier you outlined the two main axes for our investigation, the first being “code and axiomatics” and the second being the way in which desire invests the social field, the question being how it does so. I’m curious why you didn’t take that line of inquiry further and ask _why_. What I’m getting at is something along the lines of what happens in fascism—to take a random example—there’s a relationship which shows us why the desire/social field relationship is sort of transformed; it’s the fact that the object [of desire] completely disappears. [Its] link has been severed, wrecked. This is illustrated rather well in certain surrealist films from 1940-40 [_sic_], where we see money depreciating, inflation, for example. And there’s an element that sort of makes the object of desire completely disappear; some essential aspect gives rise to, lends itself to fascism as we know it. I suppose that after a given period of transformation, we more or less find the same process—different, but similar.

Gilles Deleuze: You began with the necessity of asking “why.” I understand everything you said afterwards, but I don’t quite understand why this question is necessary, and how it fits in with the rest of what you said. I think there’s no need to ask “why” because this whole system of machines is due to functionalism. If you ask “why,” you’re back to working with categories of signifiers; it’s a risky question. I believe there’s a domain—the domain of machines we call machines of desire, or desiring machines—where what we get is functionalism, that is, our only question is “How does it work?”—“How” and not “Why.” And this is why certain ethnologists are still in touch with how desire manifests in the social field—when they ask themselves, “What exactly is the purpose of psychoanalysis? Does it really serve our purposes as ethnologists?” And they say yes and no, because for us, as ethnologists, at the end of the day what we’re interested in has nothing to do with what something means—however one poses that question—it’s actually: “How does it work in the social field?”

Then it’s clear where the argument goes from there: never does the function or the use of something explain its production. For example, the way in which an organism functions could never explain that organism’s mode of production, or how an institution functions could never explain how the institution itself is formed. I think this anti-functionalist argument is spot-on, but in what context? [It’s spot-on] at the level of large aggregates, of molar aggregates.[[1]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-04-11/#_edn1) There, indeed, how something is used always comes second to how something is formed. But if we’re trying to approach the unconscious in terms of machines, in terms of factories, in terms of units of production, in terms of desiring machines, I don’t think these are big machines; they are micro-machines. The machinic unconscious, the unconscious of desiring machines, is essentially a micro-unconscious, a micro-logical, micro-physical unconscious. Or, if you prefer, it’s a molecular unconscious.

Yet, in other words, at the level of molecular formations, as opposed to molar aggregates, strictly speaking, there is no possible difference between form and function. If I say how something works, there’s nothing else I can say. For schizo-analysis, the question isn’t at all — I recognize that the question “What does it mean” is rather complex because at a certain point, “What does it mean” might simply refer to a signified, or as they say, the whole question is knowing, when talking about the signifier, whether the question is still “What does it mean,” or whether it’s something else. Personally, I think it’s the same question. The question is still “What does it mean,” only crossed out, but it still falls under “What does it mean,” while desiring machines, strictly speaking, don’t _mean_ anything—neither in terms of signifieds, nor in terms of signifiers — for schizo-analysis, the problem is: “What are your machines?” And that’s not easy to figure out.

A guy comes in; what are his desiring machines? It’s not enough to point out that he likes to drive, that he has a fridge—that’s all related to his desiring machines, but that’s not what his desiring machines are. On the other hand, neither are his desiring machines fantasies; they aren’t imaginary objects that function as doubles—it isn’t the dreamed car as the real car’s double… Desiring machines are molecular formations that exist objectively in larger technical machines and in larger social machines. That’s why, I think, we have to critique everything that’s dream, fantasy—the unconscious doesn’t dream, doesn’t fantasize, no more than the unconscious is a theatre. Dreams and fantasies are by-products of one’s reflection. They are territorialities of Oedipus; dreams are always oedipal. If analysts always stuck to dreams, they’d necessarily come back to Oedipus.

There’s a wonderful part of Bergson where he writes that it’s no surprise that matter and intelligence dovetail together, that matter and intelligence are tailormade for each other, since they both come from differenciating the same one movement, and well, it’s the same with Oedipus and dreams. It’s not surprising that all dreams are inherently Oedipal, because the same movement constitutes both dreams and Oedipus.

But that has nothing to do with desiring machines, so where things get tricky—I suppose—in schizo-analysis, is finding someone’s desiring machines. What’s the deal with your things, what are your machines? Then, if the person doesn’t answer in terms of machines, or if we can’t manage to find their machinic elements… obviously, that raises the question: what is our criterion? What allows us to say, ah, _there_, we’ve pinned down someone’s desiring machines? I think there are very solid criteria, and they specifically come down to this: desiring machines are molecular formations, never molar aggregates—but I get the feeling I’m not addressing your comment—all I’m saying is that, at the molecular level and only at the molecular level, functionalism reigns supreme, and that’s because function, production, form, are all one, strictly speaking. A desiring machine is defined only by how it functions, which is to say how it’s formed, which is to say how it’s produced. As it stands, I’d say that the question “why” never comes up.

Pinhas: I think maybe I didn’t word my question the right way. I wasn’t trying to question the fact that it works, or to reintroduce linguistic-psychoanalytic categories, etc. What I was trying to ask is, after the question of how, there are processes—I tried to offer an example of something I think fits the description: fascism—there’s why it works, in that sense, and then there’s why it works in another way, if you will. It works this way at one moment, and meanwhile, in another country, for example, it works another way. I think that, in that context, over and above the question how, we might afterwards ask the question why.

Deleuze: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. That’s a very particular “why,” then. It’s a “why” concerning the nature of the social field invested by desire and desiring machines. Where the social field’s characteristics come from, at such and such time, under such and such circumstances. Here, again, it’s pretty complicated. We’d need to maintain, like, two practical guidelines or principles, alongside there being desiring machines, which run along molecular lines, what I’d like to call lines of flight.[[2]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-04-11/#_edn2) It’s not even enough to reach lines of resistance in the unconscious. The essential thing about the unconscious is that it escapes; it goes along lines of flight. Yet Oedipus, fantasies, dream, and what not—far from being real productions or formations of the unconscious—are all tourniquets, plugging up the unconscious’s lines of flight or escape. That’s why we have to blow all that up to reveal its lines of flight, which then lead us to a molecular unconscious of desiring machines. These are molecular formations, micro-formations, whereby it becomes a non-figurative, non-symbolic unconscious. It’s neither figurative nor symbolic—it’s what Lacan calls the Real, only not just a possible real, but a functional real.

Then, we have to simultaneously maintain, basically, two poles: one pole would be one like—it gets tricky; fortunately, at one level we’d distinguish two poles: the first being investments of molar aggregates, investments of the social field and everything that comes with that, including family investments, the family being one molar aggregate among others, a molar sub-aggregate**.**

And then, at the other end, there’d be molecular lines of flight, just as you might distinguish between macro-physics and micro-physics. Really, then, schizo-analysis would operate in terms of units of production of the micro-unconscious of small, molecular formations—that would have to be our first principle, but at the same time—so, again, we’d need to distinguish between investments of molar aggregates and investments of molecular formations, of desiring machines, on the other side of social and technical machines. Which is how we would define one of the main activities involved in the practice of schizo-analysis: nothing can get off the ground until we get to the desiring machines of someone’s unconscious, i.e., their molecular functioning formations. If we can’t reach them, we can’t do anything; we’re still dealing with big aggregates: Oedipus, the family, etc. As I see it, the signifier is a molar sign, fundamentally, a sign structuring big, molar aggregates, thus completely unrelated to desiring machines.[[3]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-04-11/#_edn3)

So, that would be the first task for schizo-analysis: reaching the lines of flight of the unconscious. Which means the unconscious doesn’t express itself, doesn’t attract; it escapes, and it causes its desiring machines to function based on its lines of flight. As Plato might put it, when it draws near its opposite, it either retreats or perishes[[4]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-04-11/#_edn4)—in the same way, the unconscious either perishes under Oedipus or escapes through its lines of flight.

But, from another perspective—one which doesn’t cancel out the first—we’d have to make what seems like the opposite point: that all investments, no matter what kind, are necessarily molar or social. Any investment is necessarily the investment of big aggregates; all investments are investments of big aggregates by molecular formations one can identify as desiring machines. No matter what, desiring machines—their parts and their cogs—invest big molar aggregates.

The second task of schizo-analysis would be to discover the nature of these social investments in a person, at the level of the unconscious. And I’m saying the two aren’t contradictory: in one, we say there are two positions: big aggregates defined by social and technical machines, and on the other side, molecular lines of flight and desiring machines. With the other, it’s that all investments are molar and social, just that social investments have two poles: a paranoid pole, which we could just as easily call fascist, reactionary investment, which consists in subordinating desiring machines to big, repressive apparatuses, to the big apparatuses of the state or of the family. The vulgarized psychoanalytical framework has to be flipped: paranoia is what comes first, what comes second is oedipal neurosis, and then third is Narcissus. The Oedipus complex is first of all a paranoid idea; it’s only secondarily a neurotic feeling, i.e., the neurotic is someone who’s been fooled, who’s been fooled by the paranoiac. It’s a father’s notion, and it’s not a father’s notion regarding his son—he doesn’t care about his son—the paranoiac is someone who starts hallucinating their social field by sadistically subordinating all their desiring machines to the repressive apparatuses of their social field.

At any rate, desiring machines are within real machines; they don’t resemble them, as in that absurd way of understanding dreams, and so on…it’s not about saying, ah, yes, uh, uh—it’s not about making psychoanalysis some kind of gizmo, uh, for market research, where we go, _hmm, what dream car lies behind the real car_? That’s not it. Desiring machines exist objectively. They exist in the cogs and parts of social machines and technical machines; they just can’t be extracted at the macroscopic level. That’s why it takes a microscopic analysis to draw out someone’s desiring machines. Someone who’s paranoid isn’t worried about their son. Schreber’s father is _the_ paranoiac. You can see how his paranoia works, and in this regard, you can see the extent to which psychiatric understandings of paranoia are reactionary. If they didn’t link paranoia to family events, they’d be forced to acknowledge that paranoia, precisely because it has nothing to do with family relationships, is an inherently fascist, reactionary investment of one’s social field. The paranoid man’s delusions aren’t about his wife or about his son; his delusions are about race, education, culture. The schizophrenic too, but in a different way. At its root, the paranoiac’s delusion is “let’s create a pure race”: a sense that everything is in decline, that we’re no longer pure Aryans. Although he’s looking at his little kid, that’s only secondary. And there he applies—Oedipus is always an act of reduction [_rabattement_], application—he presents himself as the great pedagogue, the great restorer to the races. Schreber’s father started with a whole other dimension: the deviation of his social field. Our world’s been ruined; let’s recreate the pure race—and with what? With machines.

First, the paranoiac is delusional about the social field. I argue that paranoia ought to be defined in absolutely non-oedipal terms, as a particular way of investing the social field. A kind of investment of the social field, an investment that completely subordinates the system of desiring machines, or molecular formations, to greater molar aggregates. That in mind, in application to his family, as a privileged molar sub-aggregate, he applies his reform, his pure race, and produces an oedipalized little guy. Which is thus a product of earlier paranoid investment. It’s in this sense that the Oedipus complex is something experienced by the neurotic son inheriting his paranoid father’s big idea, but the latter’s idea isn’t oedipal; it consists in investing the entire social field.

The other idea is that everything is social investment, only it ranges between two poles: from paranoia, which broadly subordinates desiring machines to the apparatuses of large aggregates, to schizophrenia, schizophrenic escape, molecular lines of flight, desiring machines—it’s the same thing. And it’s no less deeply connected to the social field than paranoia’s sweeping integrations. It isn’t more delirious; it’s just a different sort of delirium. Because delirium has like two ends of the spectrum (constantly oscillating), and the schizophrenic side of delirium carries out the inverse sort of subordination, subordinating big molar aggregates to molecular formations. Which is why lines of flight don’t just consist in doing something; they also entail driving something away.

As a result, schizo-analysis basically has three tasks.

–  A destructive task: taking a big curette to the unconscious, i.e., has to blow up: Oedipus, dream, fantasy, myth, tragedy, no more theater—at the same time (not later on).

— Its first positive goal: reaching someone’s desiring machines. And you can never get at them directly; all we have are machinic indices, which might as well be practically hidden—that’s fine, that’s inevitable, there are only indices, not at all in the sense of “why” that I denounced earlier, but because they belong to a different regime, they’re micro-formations and only along lines of flight, or what amounts to the same, lines of decoding, of deterritorialization. The unconscious constantly deterritorializes itself; there are endless lines, lines of flight, abstract lines—again, neither symbolic, nor figurative, nor imaginary, nothing of the sort—lines of flight marked out with machinic indices. The only thing noteworthy about dreams is that they’re full of machinic indices. In dreams and fantasy, we get nothing but indices of desiring machines, and we get them in the form of molar machines; as often as daddies-mommies appear in dreams, so too do machinic indices. It isn’t a desiring machine because desiring machines aren’t dreamt, but they’re machinic indices. All the time, in fantasies, little machines appear; you have to follow their escape routes [_voies de fuite_] to get out of dream analysis; you have to delve into these kinds of machinic lines in order to go further.

— Alongside the work of scraping everything out, the sort of violent countermeasure to the unconscious pseudo-formations that have to be ruthlessly destroyed, stamped out, and the main positive task of uncovering desiring machines, the second positive task—there are criteria if you follow the lines of flight as far as you can—the second task is uncovering the nature of the social field’s unconscious investments, granted that the social field’s preconscious investments don’t work the same way. You could have rather revolutionary preconscious investments and still have paranoid, reactionary unconscious investments. What analysis needs is some equivalent to the revolution of abstract painting—that is, it needs to reach parts of the unconscious that are no longer figurative or symbolic: a molecular, abstract, machinic unconscious.

A student [_comment about Schreber’s father_]: It doesn’t start with the father’s generation; we have to go up a level (the grandmother), which is also quite something (dreaming of having a “real” man). You get the sense that it’s the paranoiac’s father who should be committed, and not his delusional son (delirium being the imaginary resolution of his fantasies). The one driving things is perfectly socially integrated, and it’s in that sense that he has delusions about the whole social field and then afterwards applies it to his son—but he’s firmly planted in his social field, which is why he avoids getting sent to the asylum. Whereas those who end up in the asylum, like paranoiacs, are those who aren’t connected enough to be spurred on by familial investments; there’s a barrier that absolutely prevents them from having any delusion about the social field. It takes three generations to make someone paranoid; as for schizos, who’s to say?

Deleuze: I take issue with your wording, but that’s beside the point. If there were only paranoiacs, there never would have been asylums. The paranoiac gets along fine. The paranoiacs who do get hospitalized are either really poor, so they think they’re little leaders, or else it’s because of schizoid elements that always get mixed in with paranoia. If they’re hospitalized, it’s certainly not because of their paranoia; it’s owing to some latent schizoid element, lying beneath the paranoia.

[Maud] Mannoni’s argument about the decision on Schreber’s case as the first act of anti-psychiatry misses the mark, since the reason Schreber was released was that his schizophrenic elements did not prevail.[[5]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-04-11/#_edn5) I’m reminded of another case, perhaps the opposite of Schreber’s, of someone with quite pronounced paranoid aspects and even more pronounced schizophrenic tendencies: Nijinsky, the dancer. No way the court would let Nijinsky go free—he went around shouting, “I am the clown of God, death to the Stock Market, the Stock Market is death, money is death!”[[6]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-04-11/#_edn6)  You could argue that saying that is unreasonable since it was just said here.

With rich paranoiacs, it’s great; they have a fundamental social function. The paranoiac is well integrated, and no one who’s paranoid will get committed to an asylum unless they fall into one of those two categories.

My second point addresses matters regarding the three family members. Looking at the three generations, we find with the most ardent anti-psychiatrists—Gisela Pankow, [R.D.] Laing, [David] Cooper—what do we end up with? When it comes to psychosis, the Oedipus complex obviously falls apart, so the question is how to salvage Oedipus. As [Guy] Rosalato naively puts it: “How do we bring psychosis back into an Oedipal framework?”[[7]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-04-11/#_edn7) Posed in that way, the problem can play out in one of several ways. We can take a structuralist route—which isn’t at all what Lacan is doing—we can use structuralism to form a structural Oedipus complex and figure out where psychosis fits into said structure. Or—these aren’t mutually exclusive—we can extend Oedipus. If the Oedipus complex doesn’t work, we widen it a bit, i.e., we bring in the grandmother, the grandfather; we argue that Oedipus no longer involves two generations but three. We’ll have to account for the grandfather. If that doesn’t work, we’ll bring in a fourth generation.

If I’m privileging the role of the father or the role of the grandfather, it’s certainly not for the sake a new take on Oedipus. At a certain point, I could ask: what comes first, the father or the child? That is, the chicken-or-egg questions doesn’t make any sense—but at the same time, it must be addressed. The father or mother comes before the child. If I claim that the father has primacy over the child, that can be interpreted in one of two ways. [First,] regressively, as an infinite regress—every child has a father—we can keep climbing further and further back up to the presupposition of a first father, the Father of the primal horde, for example. But there’s another, completely different way of interpreting it, in a way where we don’t get caught up in an indefinite familial reduction. It could mean—and this is where the question becomes nonsense—what comes first is actually the social field covering both father and child, who are simultaneously immersed in said social-historical field. In truth, the idea that the father has primacy over the child means that social investments come before familial investments.

That means understanding the unconscious as a cycle, as per Marx’s well-known response to Aristotle regarding the “cause of man [_sic_]”—yes, but there’s a cycle, the cycle whereby man produces man. The unconscious of desiring machines is a cyclical unconscious. Accounts of schizophrenogenic families fail to explain anything about how schizophrenia is produced; the most ordinary family mechanisms get portrayed as schizophrenogenic mechanisms. The father has primacy over the child, but not _as_ a father—it’s that the social field and social investments have primacy over father and son.

Why do we only find indices of the little desiring machines that invest the entire social field? These machinic lines of flight are necessarily lines of deterritorialization as such, because deterritorialization is like the inverse or opposite of the movements of reterritorialization. Even Beckett’s most extreme protagonists can’t completely deterritorialize themselves; they integrate small patches of land[[8]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-04-11/#_edn8), Malone’s room, a trash can. The movement of deterritorialization can only be grasped through the gene and the nature of the reterritorializations carried out by an individual.

It’s always by way of a reterritorialization’s countermovement that we can determine the degree of deterritorialization. For example, the neurotic has already found a foothold to cling onto: Oedipus. The analyst’s couch is the second thing that won’t budge, the bit of land one must cling to—otherwise everything gets rocky.

We have to demonstrate how capitalism never stops deterritorializing and, with its axiomatics, reterritorializing. For example, fascism was a process of reterritorializing the masses, however terrible. You can only read someone’s deterritorialization—and how far it’s gone—that is, someone’s schizophrenic terror, through their counter-terrors, the reterritorializations they carry out. That’s why we shouldn’t think of perverts in terms of their impulses. We should think of them in terms of their territory: perverts are folks who want neither the territoriality of Oedipus nor the territoriality of the couch. That won’t do—they invent artificial territory, artificial groups. They have their own way of reterritorializing themselves, and if all else fails, as a last resort, you reterritorialize yourself as a body without organs, i.e., lying catatonic in the hospital, the poorest territory of all. You’ve recreated your little foothold.

What matters is that the movement of deterritorialization isn’t simply susceptible to getting taken up in a perverse reterritorialization, be it psychoanalytic or perverse in the strict sense, but that the movement of deterritorialization is strong enough to—cleaving to its revolutionary lines of flight—create for itself a new type of land. Perhaps that’s what Nietzsche means when he says that one day “the earth shall become a place of healing.”[[9]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-04-11/#_edn9) Perhaps, rather than being reterritorialized on artificial land, under certain conditions, the movement of deterritorialization might come to be the creator of a new earth. It would be nice, at any rate.

Eric: Three generations are relevant. It doesn’t go any further than that. There’s been a psychotic episode—there must be a mechanism there linking it to something, the “name of the father,” triggering the patient’s hospital psychosis. The same way you distinguish between schizophrenia and hospital schizophrenia, there’s also a difference between psychosis and hospital psychosis. Hence Lacan’s work, which demonstrates the role of exclusion, which is linked to the father in a certain way—not the real father, but the father as an investment of the social field—in this idea of hospital paranoia.

Deleuze: We’ll have to pick back up on this next week. I disagree.

[[1]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-04-11/#_ednref1) Per Hurley, Seem, and Lane’s translation, _ensemble_ here has been translated as “aggregate.” See, for example, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, _Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia,_ trans. Robert Hurley, Mark Seem, and Helen R. Lane (Minneapolis: UMP, 1983), p. 181.

[[2]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-04-11/#_ednref2) _Ligne de fuite_ is a ubiquitous term in Deleuze and Guattari’s work (and in the scholarship surrounding their work). In addition to translating _fuite_ as “flight,” it also appears here as “escape,” or “getting out.” For readers with a background in electrical engineering, _ligne de fuite_ is a term for “leakage distance” or “creepage distance.”

[[3]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-04-11/#_ednref3) The tasks of schizo-analysis are defined in _Anti-Oedipus_, chapter IV.

[[4]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-04-11/#_ednref4) _Phaedo_ 102d.

[[5]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-04-11/#_ednref5) See _Anti-Oedipus_, p. 364. Deleuze and Guattari cite Chapter 7 of Maud Mannoni, _Le Psychiatre, son fou et la psychanalyse._

[[6]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-04-11/#_ednref6) Deleuze and Guattari quote Vaslav Nijinsky’s _Journal,_ or _Diary_ (Paris: Gallimard, 1953), in _Anti-Oedipus,_ p. 77.

[[7]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-04-11/#_ednref7) A possible reference is to Guy Rosalato’s _Essais sur le symbolique_ (Paris : Gallimard, 1969), cited in _Anti-Oedipus,_ p. 210.

[[8]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-04-11/#_ednref8) In this translation, _terre_ appears as a patch of land, a foothold, a territory—for the sake of more comfortable English, the translation may obscure the word’s connection to Deleuze and Guattari’s paired terms, “deterritorialization” and “reterritorialization.”

[[9]](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-04-11/#_ednref9) _Thus Spake Zarathustra._
