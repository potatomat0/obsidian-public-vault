# Lecture 1

>So, there’s a first topic that we will put aside for the moment, concerning a certain number of figures of _segmentarity_. And then there’s a second topic, which concerns at the same time _molar aggregates_ and _molecular lines_. And, of course, these molar aggregates and molecular lines become mixed. … Last time we also sketched out a third topic which was a rapid analysis, or rather a rapid effect of the analysis, of the verb “to be” as a principle of the molar aggregates and their elements. … Today, I’d like to start on a fourth topic and this fourth topic would consist more or less in saying that we will try to establish a certain status typical of what we could call “molecular multiplicities”.

### SEMINAR INTRODUCTION

Deleuze’s 1975-1976 seminars were filmed by one of his students, Marielle Burkhalter, as part of her masters project, “Filming Philosophy as it Happens.” Enrico Ghezzi acquired the videos for broadcast on the RAI 3 cinema programme “Fuori Orario,” after inviting Burkhalter to screen them at a festival he co-curated. Marielle Burkhalter, along with Stavroula Bellos, would eventually become the director of the [_L’association Siècle Deleuzien_](http://www2.univ-paris8.fr/deleuze/article.php3?id_article=2), and oversaw the French transcriptions of Deleuze’s seminars at the [_Voix de Gilles Deleuze_](http://www2.univ-paris8.fr/deleuze/) website at the University of Paris 8.

Links to a number of these recordings that are available on YouTube are provided below, each of which includes subtitles in Italian. We are grateful to those who have uploaded these videos.

We have ordered the video material chronologically and divided it into 3 categories, providing short titles describing the topics covered for general orientation.

The first category (A) refers to the aforementioned seminars that were filmed at Paris-8 Vincennes in 1975-76, while Deleuze and Guattari were working on specific “plateaus” within what would become “Mille Plateaux”. We have clues for approximate dates and one specific indication to help situate these. First, in the session (or sessions) under the Molar and Molecular Multiplicities recording, Deleuze addresses material in _A Thousand Plateaus_ that precedes topics discussed in the subsequent Il Senso in Meno recordings. Then, an Iranian student speaking in session 7 states this session’s date as February 3, 1976. Thus, for the sessions 2 through 6, we have provided approximate dates for successive Tuesdays that follow session 1 and precede February 3, while two sessions, 4 & 5, that occur on the same day, receive the same date. For the sessions following session 7, we have provided approximate dates corresponding to subsequent Tuesdays while 1) making adjustments for a missing session that preceded session 8; and 2) including under March 2 both session 9 (all three segments included in the recording) and session 10.

The second category (B) includes seminars from 1980-87, after the campus of Vincennes had been demolished and relocated to St. Denis. The third category (C) features fragments and short clips from the Il Senso in Meno recordings, which we have ordered sequentially and have also provided time stamps to the transcriptions.

Deleuze in his seminar at the University of Paris VIII, Vincennes, in 1975.

*_This session corresponds to the YouTube recording, Deleuze su molteplicità molare et molteplicità molecolare__,_ containing segments from three successive Tuesday sessions. The Part I opening is remarkable for providing visual evidence of the extraordinarily cramped space in which Deleuze worked at Vincennes, where he acknowledges Guattari’s presence who does not intervene in the recording. After reviewing previous topics discussed, Deleuze introduces variables of molecular multiplicities that Deleuze lists: bridges; a network; the borderline (_bordure_); threshold or door; fiber; and the plane of consistency or rhizosphere. Deleuze steps back to consider multiplicities of a primarily molar nature and their characteristics, and he points out that within the molar schema, all kinds of other phenomena intervene and perturb the molar multiplicities. These constitute forms of mixing that Deleuze outlines, and in contrast to the centralized molar multiplicity, Deleuze develops a network of linkages each time with a black hole that is both receiver and emitter of each element, of each black hole. Deleuze then focuses on the molecular multiplicities defined through their dimensions, specifically their maximal dimension that is the borderline, with reference to work by René Thom and examples from Melville, Virginia Woolfe, Henry Miller, and Lovecraft. As the recording shifts, Deleuze develops the importance of gangs in terms of the molar aggregate organization, with a centralized leader, but also points to molecular aspects of the gang organize that shift back into the molar aggregate, on one hand, the phenomena of the borderline or flight, on the other, a shift back to a centralized leadership and organizing function. A third, very brief fragment commences in mid-quotation from Lovecraft (located in _A Thousand Plateaus_, p. 251) with Deleuze discussing the possibility of numerous dimensions possessed by molecular multiplicities, with reference to Woolfe’s _The Waves_ and Kafka “Josephine the Singer”. These examples allow Deleuze to connect, in the fragment’s final minutes, with the simultaneity of two asymmetrical becomings that he calls a block of becoming.*

[_This recording contains segments from three successive Tuesday sessions given the evident shifts, from one part to the next, of camera locations, blackboard drawings, students near Deleuze, and classroom configurations. Moreover, Part I begins with Deleuze’s review of specific points covered in several preceding sessions for which we have no recordings, followed by shorter, successive segments. Hence, we situate the approximate session dates as I, starting on November 18, 1975, II continuing on November 25, and ending with a brief segment III, on December 2._]

[_Deleuze entering the room very slowly, due crowd blocking his path_]

Deleuze: How are we going to manage?

A woman student: We can just stay here like this.

Another woman student: It’s not complicated… you just have to lift your leg…

Deleuze: I can’t. It’s stuck… [_Pause_] It’s not just to be able to move, it’s so we can breathe… [_Pause_] It’s a life question! [_Pause_]

A woman student: Can you put out that cigarette?

Deleuze: Aaaah! [_He lifts his legs and continues trying to enter_] [_Pause_] Hello, Félix. [_Pause; Deleuze observes the crowd, looks at the blackboard for chalk, slowly takes off his coat, then places his books on the table_] I’d like to raise a problem, an interesting one. Over there, [_He points to the left, his right_] there’s glass fiber there. Imagine if a fire broke out. _[Pause__]_ You see the door? [_He points over to his far left_] We would all die. All of us. [_Nervous laughter_]

A woman student: Unless we jump from the window. [_Pause_]

Deleuze: Except me, perhaps… [_Laughter_] But all of you will perish. Which is to say you shouldn’t come to class; I have to be quite honest! The working conditions here don’t conform to safety norms. So when the fire starts, don’t panic. We don’t move, we don’t worry…

Guattari: Have you seen Narboni who was waiting for you…

Deleuze: Sorry?

Guattari: Tu as vu Narboni ?

Deleuze: Yes, I’ve seen Narboni. [_Pause; Deleuze speaks to students behind him quite softly perhaps to ask that they not smoke_] … That will make me choke. _[Pause__] That’s better. [Pause__]_ Does anyone have a piece of chalk? _[Pause__]_ Some chalk? _[Pause__] Some_ chalk? _[Pause__]_ Thank you… Ok, so, as usual I will summarize the topics we have already covered because… what is it?

A student: I can’t hear very well.

Deleuze: It will come. My voice is always a bit low to begin with. It will come. So, the topics… I think we began with… I’ll always recapitulate like this, so that when we go back to a given topic, those who were present…

A woman student: Louder!

Deleuze: Oh no, shit, really? — … those who were present will be able to recall it. So, there’s a first topic that we will put aside for the moment, concerning a certain number of figures of _segmentarity_. And then there’s a second topic, which concerns at the same time _molar aggregates_ and _molecular lines_. And, of course, these molar aggregates and molecular lines become mixed. We also briefly mentioned two complementarities, two relations of complementarity between the molar aggregates and the molecular lines that mix with them.

First of all, there is a direct complementarity: the bigger the molar aggregates become, the more the molecular lines become enmeshed with them, trace movements of flight etc. And there is also a second complementarity that is… Did I start with the direct one? I don’t remember…

A student: Yes.

Deleuze: There is an inverse complementarity. Last time, we also sketched out a third topic which was a rapid analysis, or rather a rapid effect of the analysis, of the verb “to be” as a principle of the molar aggregates and their elements. And, on the other hand, we made an analysis of the conjunction “and” as a broken-line type of movement, a movement of the molecular line. And we imagined a kind of… tension – which is not contradiction – but a kind of tension between the _“est”_ (is) of the verb “to be” and the _“et”_ (and) of the conjunction, and we said that this tension would, for different reasons, traverse language as a whole, or at least certain languages.

And some of you raised the objection that apparently, in some languages this tension between _“est”_ and _“et”_ doesn’t exist. Not only does it not exist but also the very structure of these languages denies it. This really unsettled us and yet, at the same time, we noted that a certain play of the conjunction “and” defines minor languages, or the minor use of certain languages, in opposition to the imperialism and hegemony of the verb “to be” in so-called major languages. And we also realized that we would have to return to this objection for the themes for which we had no answer at the time, thinking we would devote a lesson to it, and those who had made objections, namely that this wouldn’t work, at least in the cases of Arabic or Chinese.

But we were reassured by the fact that it did work for languages I proposed to call neither minor nor major – languages eroded from within by strong minorities, such as British and American English. British and American English as a whole are traversed by a very peculiar use of the conjunction “and”. There we are. You may have found all this a bit dispersive, but I think you’ve understood that… [_Deleuze does not complete the sentence_]

Today, I’d like to start on a fourth topic and this fourth topic would consist more or less in saying that we will try to establish a certain status typical of what we could call “molecular multiplicities”. You see, this could be considered a different topic but at the same time it’s the same as the previous ones because it implies a certain rapport between multiplicities that we call “molar” and multiplicities that we call “molecular”. And, together with Guattari, I have sought… I don’t want to go back to things we’ve already covered but I would like to tell you how we have managed to advance on this somewhat. We looked for a certain number of variables that could be considered variables of a particular type of multiplicity, which we will call “molecular”. I pronounce these first of all for the pleasure the words give me, but also so that all of you can bear them in mind and to situate them in aggregates, in masses, in multiplicities.

The variables we wish to propose today are those that correspond to the category of _bridges_. A bridge. A bridge might not seem very molecular but it doesn’t matter. A bridge… Second variable: _ring_, or _network_. Third variable: _borderline_. Fourth variable: _threshold_ and _door_. Fifth variable: _fiber_. Sixth variable, which is obviously the most beautiful: _rhizosphere_, or _plane of consistency_. Good. I’ll say that for the moment I would roughly like to place them, while avoiding anything to do with axioms or structures. I want to place these variables within a certain type of multiplicity.

Obviously…  obviously these multiplicities or these masses don’t exist on their own. I think again of the objection we began with yesterday, that all this is anyhow a form of dualism. Molecular multiplicities, when they are present, spread or stretch out, they spread together with multiplicities of large aggregates, multiplicities we shall call “molar”. They are inside, they slip underneath, spread out on the surface, they always exist one within the other, according to what we previously defined as a double complementarity.

So, we have to begin again from the schema we proposed at a certain point that concerned – and here I’ll be brief – multiplicities of a primarily molar nature. How do we recognize a molar multiplicity? Molar multiplicities include both aggregates – large aggregates – and the elements of these large aggregates. You remember how we were convinced that the distinction molar/molecular doesn’t correspond to that between aggregate and element? So, molar multiplicities are a certain type of aggregate comprised of certain elements.

How do we define them? We proposed to define them through the schema of arborescence. Each time you have an arborescent schema you have the formal pattern of a multiplicity that we can call a _molar multiplicity_. The simplest arborescent schema – because arborescent schemas are extremely complicated – the simplest arborescent schema is that which proceeds — I’m not brave enough to go to the blackboard, so please follow my finger — is that which proceeds by a succession of dichotomies. But there are others that are more complicated. If I try to express the arborescent schema in its most general form… — perfect, perfect [_Deleuze reacts to someone on his right who has brought in a tree branch, soon to be visible on camera; Deleuze stands and goes to the board_] But the one you’ve got is simple — _[Pause__]_ More or less it, would be this. [_Pause_] I can’t continue because… well, we don’t need this. [_Pause_] So, there we have an arborescent schema in its most general form.

If I try now quickly to list its characteristics, even if this means connecting them with things we looked at last year, I would say that in this aggregate, in this type of multiplicity – the molar multiplicity – their first characteristic is that _binary machines exist in their own right_. Every time, you have a dichotomizing operation that exists in its own right. Once again, either you’re a man or a woman, a bourgeois or a proletarian and so on. It’s all a play of binary machines that exist in their own right.

Second characteristic: there is… these multiplicities that we call molar are _centered multiplicities_. Here, the center is shown by the small circle. In other words, if I try to connect it to the things that we looked at last year, there is a central black hole. And this central black hole is not the only one. On the contrary… All the other black holes spread around the multiplicity, resonate together with the central black hole, which in this way is able to move in all directions. Last year, we would have said: All the eyes resonate in a kind of central computer-eye, a single eye, a third eye, which organizes the multiplicity as a whole.

Third characteristic: I will say that these multiplicities are _evolutive multiplicities_, even if they don’t actually evolve. But if they don’t evolve, what happens to them? If they don’t evolve, they end up regressing. Yet both regression and progression are characteristics – directions – of evolution itself. By evolutive multiplicities I mean that they undergo a progression or a regression. In other words, what determines these multiplicities are lines of filiation or lines of lineage.

It’s not by chance that the doctrine that was called Evolutionism began – and I stress that this was just a beginning because it wasn’t limited to this – it began by posing questions in terms of filiation and lineage. In this regard, Darwin’s key text speaks of how the novelty of Evolutionism consists in raising the questions of filiation and lineage that had never been posed by previous natural historians. However, this doesn’t mean they ignored other phenomena. So what are these phenomena? We shall see, we shall see… These other phenomena, which we’ll look at later, are treated as categories that have to be subordinated to phenomena of filiation and lineage.

Other characteristic, and now I’d like to read you a text. “In an arborescent system, only a single neighbor is admitted: the hierarchical superior.” [_The text is by Pierre Rosenstiehl and Jean Petitot, “Automate asocial et systèmes acentrés”,_ Communications _22 (1974); see_ A Thousand Plateaus_, pp. 16-17_] It’s all in the schema. You start from a branch, this point that I call “small a” admits only one neighbor, the one from which it receives information, and which in the arborescent series of ramifications is its hierarchical superior. Or, if you prefer, from the perspective of filiation, its ancestor. The genetic ancestor, for example.

The text goes on: “In an arborescent system, the channels of transmission are pre-established. Arborescence pre-exists the individual, who is integrated into it at a precise point.” In computer science, this is called “a regime of centered automata”. It goes without saying that if I try – from the point of view of evolutive multiplicities – to define what is progression in opposition to regression, I would say that progression is the passage from the least differentiated (like you have there for example) to the most differentiated. In fact, when biologists of Darwin’s epoch were asked what was the single criterion for organic progression, they would say it’s an organism that becomes increasingly differentiated.

The last feature I wish to insist upon is that in these molar multiplicities… — I’m not fully committed here; we could really… these are questions that I’d like almost immediately to pose to you; we could trace a genesis, a passage from one characteristic to the other; it would be easy to consider how they end up, but it’s not worth it; let’s just consider them as characteristics — So the last characteristic I will consider for the moment is that, in this type of multiplicity, there must be a principle of what we will call _organization_ or _structuration_, which conducts the increasingly advanced game of differentiation or which distributes the binarities, the dichotomies, or which makes the black holes circulate throughout the entire system. But what is interesting is that this organizing or structuring principle is always hidden. It lets us see but is itself unseen.

So, for molar multiplicities what is invoked is an intelligibility that is deeper than sensibility. Or we have an interior – for example an interior of life – deeper than the manifestations of life. For example, as far as we know… I would almost say that if we can recognize in a multiplicity one of the aforementioned characteristics… I hope that in today’s seminar it will all become clearer and more concrete. But if we found one of the aforementioned features at a concrete level in a multiplicity, I think we could say: however small it may be, however minuscule the elements at play, what we have is a molar multiplicity.

I’ll give you an example: so-called Western music, and by this I’m not referring just to contemporary music but to classical music. In a way, we’ve always been told that there was a principle that we can also call… that for a musical work considered as a sonic multiplicity, there was a principle that could be called, no matter, a structuring principle or an organizational principle, and it was this principle that gave us to hear or listen. It was this principle that let us hear what we heard. But in and for itself, it went unheard. And if we consider what certain composers – even contemporary composers like Stockhausen or Boulez – refer to today as _structure_, it’s clear that a musical structure _makes us hear_. But the structure itself goes unheard. And perhaps, if we take this term in a wider sense, it can be understood only through what it lets us hear.

Now, here’s the question I wanted to ask without any need of an immediate answer: I wonder if, for example, what we could broadly call the Western conception of the unconscious doesn’t depend precisely on this type of molar multiplicity. We shall see… For the moment, all this is still quite abstract, but I would like to speak about things of a more concrete nature. We don’t even need to mention now that there exist multiplicities of another type — _molecular multiplicities_ — but let’s just say that in this schema of molar multiplicities you have all kinds of other phenomena slipping in, making irruptions, mixing with, penetrating molar multiplicities and constituting within them – in a completely immanent manner – another type of multiplicity that will perturb them from within. This is an important thing to bear in mind for the future because, if there are such workings from within, if molar multiplicities are affected by multiplicities of a different nature, you’ll see that we will be able to find a better order for the topics we covered in the last few lessons.

I would like to demonstrate this by mixing almost everything together, which is to say by invoking a little bit of science and a bit of… not exactly dream, but I don’t know, let’s say literature. But I won’t mix them, because otherwise none of you will give it credence. I would like to identify some poles – a certain number of poles – pertaining to what certain experts are researching. And this is important for us because in every field today… Guattari and I, when we find a specific example that we can’t fully understand, because the scholars can be extremely difficult… the only thing we immediately understand is that each time they say: “What we apply are above all arborescent schema”, which incidentally are much more elaborate than my little schema. You would need specialized mathematicians to make sense of them. But for example, in mathematical statistics – which is an extremely difficult, highly complex field – they have a method called (and it’s not by chance they’ve given it this name, since scholars don’t use metaphors) _counting trees._ Today mathematical statistics uses it all the time, but counting-trees methods don’t account for the kind of phenomena I’m interested in.

We have to find a completely different model – I don’t care what term we use – a completely different model or schema or type. And everywhere you look — in biology, mathematics, physics, chemistry, linguistics, everywhere — in every field, arborescent schema that for a long time have been dominant, and which according to me are still completely tied to the axiomatic period of science, are in the process of being overturned. Because science has ceased to be, or has ceased to take up, any kind of axiomatic or structural ideal.

But let’s try to be more concrete. First of all, we have to confront the existence of what we can only call _bridges._ Bridges… and so what would a bridge be? Actually, we don’t really need to depart from my schema on the blackboard. It’s enough to simply add it in. And the question I want to pose now is: will this schema be able to answer or account for what I wish to add here? And what I wish to add is… this and this. Twice. Two bridges.

So how should we define these bridges? As _whatever_ _connection between two heterogeneous lines or lineages_. These are things that all of us know, and that we’ve already looked at, so I’m going to speed things up a bit. Let’s go back to some examples that Guattari and I have already developed at length. There’s an odd story we keep going back to, which is quite fascinating: wasp-orchid. [_See_ A Thousand Plateaus, _pp. 10-13, 293-294_] In simple terms, the orchid reproduces a sort of image of the wasp in such a way that it can wed itself to the wasp’s image. A kind of transversal bond is created between two realms, between an element of the vegetable kingdom and one of the animal kingdom. This is what I would call a _bridge_.

You see what we’re attempting to derive. You can never derive a bridge from a filiation. If I was to seek a common filiation, my whole schema would collapse because I placed the bridge between two series, two differentiated lines. But here at the top of the board we have a common filiation, and the bridge makes it collapse. We would have to find a common filiation, a common ancestor of the wasp and the orchid. We can actually go as far as saying that a bridge is always _between realms_ [_inter-règne_].

So already here, we have no choice if we accept all this, that there are bridges. Bridges don’t only exist in biology. Physicists and chemists too speak of having to introduce bridges into piles. In current theories regarding polymers, for example, there is a need to introduce bridges – while classical schemes don’t acknowledge this.

I would say that the bridge is always a term of alliance, an alliance between two realms, so the living world is no longer understood – I’m exaggerating – so the different parts of the living world are no longer understood in terms of filiations and lineages but of alliances, which suits us perfectly. Because if we try to define Neo-evolutionism, which is to say Post-Darwinian evolutionary theory, we would say that it’s a theory that has increasingly been forced to renounce the primacy, the hegemony of the theme of filiations.

So can we say there is a wasp-orchid alliance? We know there exist phenomena of vital alliances in the aggregates of so-called symbioses or parasitisms, but more generally in the domain of symbiosis. It would be interesting if evolution occurred through alliance rather than filiation, at which point perhaps it would no longer be evolution. So what would it be? Another kind of multiplicity: _molecular multiplicities_, micro-multiplicities.

Bridges define and bring into play a whole system of micro-multiplicities. But in what sense? For example, in contemporary genetic research we are told that beyond any filiation there may be communication between two lines, two completely independent series, through a virus. A virus that connects both to the genetic inheritance of a given species and to that of another species that has nothing in common with the first – so the virus functions as a bridge between two species with no common filiation and which have absolutely nothing to do with one another.

Viruses are interesting because they introduce us more closely to a molecular schema: alliances that go against nature… but, even if there are other types, aren’t all alliances _interkingdom_ in nature, made between two realms? So that’s what we call _a bridge_, and that would be the first feature of this type of multiplicity: connections of whatever type between independent series or between lines irreducible to a filiation or a common lineage.

A student: More slowly please!

Deleuze: What?

The student: Not so fast…

Deleuze: Am I going too fast for you? On the contrary, I’m going to go even faster! … [_Tape interrupted_] [37:43]

There… now my schema is perfect. Good. See? I’ve got bridges which are themselves connected to each other. Why is this interesting? Because… it’s not that interesting? Why is it interesting? Because it’s a state where there is a swarming of black holes, a multiplicity of black holes that doesn’t let itself… that doesn’t resonate within a central black hole. Why is this?

Well, in contrast to a feature of molar multiplicities that we saw before, here each element – each black hole if you will — each element is at once emitter and receiver. In the theory of automata – and I insist on this point – everything that cannot be reduced to an arborescent schema implies that each element is both emitter and receiver. So that’s what our schema looks like, and it’s not reducible to an arborescent schema. You see? I have my network, my ring, and my connecting bridges, each time with a black hole that is both receiver and emitter of each element, of each black hole. As a result, you no longer have a hierarchical arborescent structure but a ring.

Now I’m going to read something by a contemporary specialist who researches certain phenomena in physics. It’s a text that I’d like Guattari to comment on later, if he feels like it… [_Pause_] Page 906: “If we suppose that clusters have a simple ramified structure like a family tree, we omit the possibility of cyclization”. You see… the phenomenon of cyclization that unites all the elements in a network, such that each is at once emitter and receiver.

You see that up until now — I wish I had spoken in more concrete terms; I started badly; I should have begun with some concrete examples but now it’s too late — Up until now — maybe I can get back on track — I’ve limited myself to a single multiplicity. But something is happening here. I’m trying to show how in any molar multiplicity something of another nature begins to insinuate itself. It’s still a molar multiplicity but something odd is slipping into it, laying down its bridges, connecting them in networks and rings. But what is this? Don’t be surprised if we have to turn to horror stories as much as to science in order to figure this out. In fact, with my first two notions of bridge and ring (or network), I’ve remained within the context of a given multiplicity, one that is single and determined, a particular multiplicity.

How do we define it? This is my third notion. How do we define a multiplicity? In the case of a _molar multiplicity_ we define it through – as we saw – a structuring or organizing principle that isn’t given as such. Here, at least, the answer is simple. But in the case of these crafty multiplicities, these discreet multiplicities that insinuate themselves, that we are trying to catch as they insinuate themselves… I can’t say they have an organizing or structuring principle since that’s how I defined molar multiplicities. What defines this kind of multiplicities — and this too is something we covered last year so I’ll be brief — what defines these multiplicities is a certain number of dimensions that they have. These multiplicities are defined through their dimensions.

But how do you understand how many dimensions they have? Well, they have a maximal dimension. A maximal dimension, each of these multiplicities has a maximal dimension, and here’s where it gets interesting. It’s by determining the maximal dimension of a multiplicity that I am able to say how many dimensions it has. It will have as many dimensions as are contained by the maximal dimension.

Now what is this maximal dimension? It’s what we can only call _borderline_ and there it is, all at once we’re saved! The maximal dimension of a multiplicity is called _borderline_. It’s a strange thing, [_Pause_] it’s a strange things, this notion of the _borderline_… as that which allows us to define a particular type of multiplicity, a _molecular multiplicity_, as opposed to the molar type, which is defined through a structuring organizing principle that remains secret, hidden.

It’s a bizarre thing… If we take say a “fly” multiplicity or a “fog” multiplicity, or a “mosquito” — finally we’re down to the concrete, while still remaining within science — what are these multiplicities?  A fly by itself means nothing. A single fly is a lost fly, that is to say, it’s not a fly. What means something is when we say “flies”.  Félix and I said that the same is true for other beasts, but it bears repeating. One wolf doesn’t mean anything. “Wolves” means something. Or, rather, “wolf” means a lone wolf but the loner, well, isn’t he the border of the wolf multiplicity? Very good.

If the loner were the border of the multiplicity constituted by the pack of wolves, then we wouldn’t have to think of him as we do normally: as an exceptional individual. But simply, as the _borderline_ determining the maximal dimension of the multiplicity, we shall call the “wolf multiplicity”, which is different from other multiplicities. And what about Moby Dick? Moby Dick, the great white whale? What is he, if not the _borderline_ of the school of whales? Perhaps it always takes a monster to make the borderline, and we have to ask ourselves why this is.

You may think I have totally abandoned science, but what I’m saying is completely scientific. It’s not surprising that neo-evolutionists think solely in terms of populations. They no longer distinguish species or types. Evolutionary theorists no longer speak of species or types but only of populations. There is no animal species or type, only animal populations or vegetable populations. In any case, the borderline is merely, I’d like… [_Deleuze does not complete the sentence_]

And here I have a text by a famous mathematician called René Thom. Oddly enough, René Thom writes… Thom loves opposing military-type aggregates or societies to those of a more fluid nature. Which suits us fine. Military societies are typically arborescent – this too was part of last year’s seminar – power apparatuses are essentially ramified arborescent structures. So we’re OK with Thom’s premise. And he speaks of a multiplicity that suits us perfectly, a _micro-multiplicity_ or _molecular multiplicity_: a swarm of mosquitoes.

Here’s what he says: “Every individual in the group moves in an random manner” — that’s not what happens in molar societies or aggregates – “to the point where it can see the rest of the swarm in the same half-space”. [_René Thom,_ Structural Stability and Morphogenesis, _trans. D. H. Fowler (Reading, MA: Benjamin Fowler/Cummings, 1975), p. 319; see_ A Thousand Plateaus, _p. 245)_] This is perfect for us, you’ll understand… Every mosquito — and here Thom says something extraordinary — every mosquito is the borderline of the multiplicity of a mosquito swarm, and every mosquito in the swarm functions in its turn as the swarm’s borderline. That’s what can happen.

We saw another case, where a small military-type principle emerges, where the borderline is assured by a chief, a leader of the pack, a squad or gang leader. But in the mosquito’s case, every member of the group moves in a random way, unless it can see the others in the same half-space. Which means that if you follow the route of a mosquito or a fly – obviously it would be different if it was attracted by blood or a piece of flesh – but if you observe its random path, the rule of chance is that every mosquito will move up to a limit position. What is this limit position?

If we imagine a closed space, the limit will be the point where the mosquito finds itself so as to have all the others on its right, for example…You follow me? At that moment, its position will be on the borderline, and Thom says: “At this point it hurries to re-enter the group. In this example, stability is assured in catastrophe…” — an important concept for Rene Thom, who has a mathematical concept of catastrophe — “In this example, stability is assured in catastrophe by a barrier…” There’s no better way to describe the borderline. A gang or band has a number of dimensions determined by a maximal dimension: the borderline. In the case of the mosquito swarm, the borderline can be precisely defined as the line in function of which a mosquito situated on it will see all the other members of the swarm on one side, at which point it re-enters the swarm.

It’s interesting, this position of being on the borderline… we should take advantage of it. Being on the borderline, being on the borderline… Being on the borderline means to be part of the gang while not being inside the gang. Being on the periphery, then re-entering the gang before going back to the periphery. But I wonder… isn’t it typical when you are part of a gang, this fact of occupying the position of the borderline? At the limit, as Thom says of mosquitoes [_Pause as Deleuze tries to find the quote_], as Thom says of mosquitoes [_Pause as he continues looking, then sits back trying to remember_] ah, yeh, yeh, yeh [_Pause as he continues reflecting_] … oh I don’t remember, I don’t remember… As Thom says of mosquitoes [_A woman student says something_] Yes! It’s that every mosquito, insofar as being part of a swarm, occupies the borderline position.

In a novel – and here I’ll pass quickly on to literature, since I don’t see any difference between a phrase of Thom and one of a novelist, though I see the difference in treatment.

– Yes… what is it? There are two books by Thom which are easy to find, then there’s an article… let’s see if I have the reference… and a book called _Morphology_…

A student: _Morphogenesis_?

Deleuze: _Morphology_… he’s got it wrong… it’s called _Structural Morphology_… He’s wrong, it happens to everyone…  it’s called _Structural Morphology_ and… I can’t remember, I’ll tell you later… [_Tape interrupted_] [54:00]

In _Mrs. Dalloway_ we have what Virginia Woolf presents as an extraordinary walk. [_On the “walk” in_ Mrs. Dalloway_, see_ A Thousand Plateaus, _p. 263_] Each word here is important… and in the words of her heroine she says that following that walk her problems had dissolved, disappeared, she had had many worries, a lot of problems and she realized that these problems were of little account, they concerned the choice of who she should have married, who she should have left etc. And they didn’t make much sense anymore.

It’s curious that a walk could resolve her problems. It can happen… maybe it’s no longer the same scale, maybe it’s not just a simple walk but a fantastic molecular adventure that have swept away or transformed the burdensome molar position of these problems. Should I marry or remain single, should I stay a man or become a woman, should I finally grow up etc. All kinds of molar problems, but in the end, maybe, there’s a small particle that can make all this collapse.

And Virginia Woolf, because it’s clearly her, and we’ll see why, she says that during this walk, which strangely takes place among taxis – there’s a continual passing of taxis… It’s interesting because taxis – and I’m not making this up – here I go back to science, and those scientists who have studied the matter closely… Taxis run on what are called semi-random routes, that is, the scientists…  Yes?

A woman student: Can you speak louder? We can’t hear anything.

Deleuze: Really… you can’t hear me? …

The student: [_Inaudible reply_]

Deleuze (_He pauses to reflect a moment_]: The route a taxi takes on a day’s run is like that of a mosquito in its swarm: it’s a semi-random route, because how it continues its trajectory is in part determined by the point where the previous client got off. When a taxi is drawn towards a point on the borderline, where it has all the other taxis on its right, you’ll hear the driver say: “Here I’m going to get lynched!” – which is to say he is in a rough neighborhood where he wouldn’t normally venture. Actually, I hadn’t thought of that, it will be useful later on because we’ll be dealing with a story of criminal machines… but we haven’t got there yet, but we’ll get there.

So, here we have Virginia Wolf’s walk among the taxis but she’s not _in_ a taxi, she runs into a number of people, and she walks in a way that’s literally the way they say only the English and Americans walk. You know, a walk by Henry Miller — we’ve already talked about this — isn’t the same as a walk by Michel Butor — which isn’t to badmouth Butor… but they don’t walk in the same way. Americans, English don’t stroll in the same way. Henry Miller doesn’t take a stroll around Clichy the way a Frenchman would in New York — unless he has a particular gift for it — it’s different, neither better nor [worse]. Usually, a French stroll would be more molar. The molecular stroll is a curious thing. [_On Miller’s stroll, see_ A Thousand Plateaus, _p. 482_]

So anyway, Woolf says, I sliced like a knife through everything… It’s a lovely phrase in a walk, “like a knife through everything”. Then she says — I know it almost by heart since I memorized it last night, [_Laughter_] since the book was heavy, and I didn’t want to have to bring it along — She also says: “I am a mist”.  There you have a molecular multiplicity. “I am a mist laid out among the people I know”. A beautiful phrase that… even more so because it’s not just literature – that really is how she lived, like a mist laid out among those she knew. I’m like a knife that slices through everything, that plunges into things, cuts between things. I’m… I don’t know what, a mist laid out between people. But then she says: “and at the same time I’m on the outside”, _[Pause__]_ and at the same time I remain on the outside. [_On this quote from_ Mrs. Dalloway, _see_ A Thousand Plateaus, _p. 264_]

This is an odd kind of position… it has to be explained. How is it possible? It’s strange because I don’t have the words to describe it in terms of a molar multiplicity. If I try to describe it in such terms, what will the binary machine of the molar apparatus say? It will say: “what you doing is pure literature.” You’re either outside or inside – or you’re on the periphery. You are either one of us or a foreigner from elsewhere – or you’ve been placed on sentry duty to make sure outsiders don’t get in.

And although here we have a third term – we’ve seen it so I won’t go back over it; we studied at the beginning of the year – this third term refers to a binarism, in the form of successive binary choices. First binarism: You’re either inside or outside. Second binarism: You’re (either inside or outside), this time in parenthesis – or you’re a sentry. So there is a first level of choice, then a second, but each time the choice is binary, so the three terms don’t change the binary nature of the choice.

Thus in terms of a molar multiplicity we will always have to say that this position cannot even be expressed, which is why we need three pages of a writer like Virginia Woolf to try to let us _feel_ it and to try to reawaken a small particle in us – I’m weighing my words here – literally a tiny particle that can say “But of course, this is how I live”. The particle that is always on the borderline of the multiplicity to which it belongs — I can’t think of a more precise formula for the moment — a particle that is always on the borderline of the multiplicity to which it belongs. [_On the borderline linked to Woolf’s walk, see_ A Thousand Plateaus_, p. 29_]

Yet we still have a small problem. We have two cases: it can be any particle whatever, as in the case of a mosquito, any mosquito whatever, since every mosquito will take up this position. Or it can be a monster mosquito, a mutant. Moby Dick, the head wolf. Ok… for the moment I’m done with the story of the borderline. You can ask me questions in a minute if you like. But I just want to finish this.

For the moment, I will say that the borderline is perfectly embodied in any particle whatsoever, molecular multiplicities are a kind of multiplicity whose elements remain on the borderline of the multiplicity so formed. So it’s by determining the position of the borderline that you know the number of dimensions the multiplicity has. If you don’t keep to the position of the borderline, you remain stuck in the molar, in the big molar aggregates.

But keeping to the borderline — you know where I’m heading… — perhaps there is a relation between what we called lines of flight and the borderline. Perhaps there’s a rapport, since the particles on the borderline, and whose path is the borderline… what can we say about these particles? It was through these particles that I defined the multiplicity in question. I can say that they function as a provisional stabilizer, a temporary stabilizer… Moby Dick functions as a temporary stabilizer of the school of whales, the head wolf serves as a temporary stabilizer of the pack. Remember what Thom said? That stability is assured in catastrophe by a barrier that assures a discontinuity in behavior. It’s a question of assuring stability. [_On the borderline and the question of stability, see_ A Thousand Plateaus, _p. 245_]

So I’d say that it’s a local temporary stabilizer, but it’s not only that. There’s a whole other aspect to it, namely, it causes the multiplicity slip inside another, that is, through the borderline, on one hand the multiplicity is stabilized, on the other the borderline is in relation with other borders, it prolongs itself through other borderlines, which, since they contain other dimensions, provoke a metamorphosis, a transformation of the molecular multiplicity in question into another molecular multiplicity.

We began from a single, determinable multiplicity without yet knowing how to define it. Then we noted how it is the borderline that determines a molecular multiplicity. However, molecular multiplicities transform into each other, since their own borderlines communicate across the border, they form with one another. As though they were thresholds, doors from one border to another, such that below a certain threshold the border defines a given multiplicity as a local stabilizer. Whereas beyond the threshold you already have another border defining another multiplicity, and these multiplicities are such that one is transformed into the other. At the limit, we would have to regard this as a kind of slippage of borders, a superseding of thresholds.

To take a rough example from science that refers to an important question: physicists and chemists are now saying that no ramified arborescent schema takes these kinds of phenomena into account. As an example, they refer to transformations of the type “sol”-“gel”, which is to say the transformation from the state of a solution to that of a “gel”. In “sol”- “gel” transitions, the solution state is actually a type of multiplicity, while the gel state constitutes another type of multiplicity. It’s a question of showing how a borderline surpasses a threshold. They call this the _percolation threshold_, to employ an admirable term that Félix Guattari learned from some of his specialist friends. [_See Guattari,_ The Machinic Unconscious, _trans. Taylor Adkins_ _(1979; Cambridge MA: MIT Press/Semiotext(e), 2011), p. 345 note 11, where Guattari refers to “effects of percolation” as synonymous with “phase transitions”_] We have to know why this is. They claim that it’s impossible to translate it in terms of arborescent schema. It’s interesting how here they require a sort of machinic notion in contrast to the arborescent model. This is important but I’ll leave it aside for the moment, though I’ll come back to it in the context of literature, or if you prefer, but… [_Deleuze does not complete his thought_]

In chemistry and physics, in the whole field of phase transitions, we see one molecular multiplicity passing into another just as one borderline approaches another. Crossing a threshold, passing through a door – whether a threshold of percolation or something else, it doesn’t matter – but it doesn’t just happen at random.

I’m almost done so I’ll be quick… This slippage of borders doesn’t happen in all fields but only on condition that the bordering molecular multiplicities change their nature, are transformed into one another. You’ll tell me that we need to provide some examples, fine… [_Tape interrupted_] [1:08:05]

… so I’ll take a seemingly fantastic example — so much the better — that of werewolves. Werewolves, werewolves… when they die they turn into vampires. So what! – you might say – that’s nothing, it’s not science. But here I’m giving you a foretaste of the literature we will need. Werewolves turn into vampires — I’m not exaggerating — werewolf and vampire stories are of interest to us because the werewolf multiplicity is also a question of the pack. One werewolf is meaningless. It’s a question of epidemic, of contagion. Not filiation. It works. There’s no filiation, we already saw that when we were studying it. There is always a pact of alliance. [_On werewolves and sorcerers as well as pacts and alliances, see_ A Thousand Plateaus, _pp. 245-247_]

But a pact of alliance with what? Here’s where demonology can serve us as a transition, a bridge between science and literature. What is the pact of alliance that is made by someone who becomes a werewolf? It occurred with the devil, or a sorcerer. Now what is the devil? With respect to our dear Lord, the good molar creature, the enormous molar creature, the devil is typically molecularized, he’s even named on account of this. The Devil, in his molecular aspect, let me think… he’s called Beelzebub, Lord of the Flies. One of the Devil’s main functions is to be Lord of the Flies, that is, of molecular multiplicities. They didn’t have the term for it then but when they said Lord of the Flies that’s what they meant.

He has many other names, having many functions, but in the end, what is this alliance with the Sorcerer? I’d say that the Sorcerer or the devil occupies the position of the borderline. It’s the monster, it’s Moby Dick, the Moby Dick of the universe… An alliance is formed, a bridge type of phenomenon an alliance is formed, a bond — we can use several different words — an alliance is formed, and one becomes a werewolf…  But the werewolf is at the same time a full member of a multiplicity. And because this multiplicity is a molecular multiplicity, even if the werewolf is big — I say this because we’re defining our multiplicities through different references of scale or size… — because it’s a molecular multiplicity, being a member of this Pack or multiplicity, the werewolf is always at the borderline of the multiplicity he forms with other werewolves. [Pause] And the werewolves are themselves at the borderline; the aggregate of werewolves, they are at the border of the multiplicity they form with other wolves, the multiplicity of wolves. [_Pause_]

But here is where things get complicated. Because when they die, according to many traditions, werewolves become vampires. And vampires belong to a completely different multiplicity. Researching this, it’s interesting how, for example, the werewolf multiplicity, or gang or pack, differs from the multiplicity of the vampire set. Here we have a nice example of the transformation of one multiplicity into another through the prolongation of a borderline where the devil, the sorcerer etc, don’t perform the same function.

However, one border can slip inside another and there can be a rupture and then another into yet another. Each time you have this meshing of borders… we can speak of fiber – hence the expression many physicists use today, when they speak about the fibers of the universe. This is interesting because the current theory of fibers in physics has established itself in opposition to a typically molar theory: brick theory. Generally speaking, brick theory states that what is most material — physical matter — has the form of brick that enters into the construction of more precarious fragile structures, such as living structures. The theory of fibers is completely different. It consists in establishing lines of continuity between elements that are taken up in terms of their own individuality. For example, the lines of continuity that run from a higher living organism to atoms, which we are told are too tiny to be subjected to the law of large numbers – “too tiny”, we’ve seen this in Schrodinger’s formula – too tiny to be subjected to the law of large numbers. This is important because the law of large numbers, statistics, is still a molar method… [_On the theory of fibers, see_ A Thousand Plateaus, _pp. 249-251, 272_] [_Tape interrupted, end of Part I_] [1:14:59]

Part II

[_Given that a seemingly different drawing is on the board and that different students are sitting behind Deleuze from one part to the next, this segment could be occurring on a different day, despite its evident connection to the previous discussion_]

… I would say that gangs are molecular multiplicities. Not because they are small but on account of their non-molar type of organization. A gang is first of all defined through its borderline and the way that each of its members conducts their business at the borderline: the members of the gang leave, and then they re-enter, each bringing in the swag, and the swag is redistributed. Obviously, there is also a central position. There are centers and it’s because of these virtual centers in the gang that it risks becoming arborescent, going over to the other side, towards a type of organization that resembles a molar aggregate.

But, generally speaking, everyone in the gang conducts their own business and at the same time it’s everyone’s business. There exist contractual rapports, relations by contract or by alliance, relations of debt, counter-debt, all kinds of weird relationships. I’m told that even in groups of drug addicts there are odd relationships of debt and alliance.

But what is strange is the way the gang is always threatened, not only from the outside by pressure from the molar aggregates, but also from the inside. Gangs are threatened from the inside by phenomena of massification or leadership, the reconstitution of a central leader or worse, of a kind of group Oedipus. For example, when a woman in the gang takes on a maternal role, she institutes a kind of group mothering. I’ve seen this happen in certain communes, this fascinating phenomenon of group mothering that reconstitutes a center in the group. In this case, it’s as though the molecular multiplicity tended literally to arborify, to molarize itself, to attain the status of a molar aggregate. And this is always the way with molecular multiplicities, not because they are particularly fragile, but because it’s something that occurs in their very movement.

So, if we define molecular multiplicities by the segments that we’ve looked at – segments of a becoming-animal, a becoming molecular and so on, through the phenomena of the borderline, or of flight — I’m not going to go into that now… — we see they’re always in danger of vacillating, of being had, of going back to the side of the molar aggregates, the way the nomadic war machine went over to the side of the state apparatus even if it had a wholly different nature and function. But it’s the same with today’s gangs, like the War Machines of ancient times, it’s all as though finally… [_Deleuze does not complete the sentence_]

There are women in gangs who create a kind of… I don’t know, I imagine many of you have noticed things like that, these phenomena, literally, both how there’s often the two-fold danger of gangs and communities reconstituting both a kind of group mothering and a leadership… which is the reason gangs are always on the verge of becoming fascist, of recreating fascistic formations. In other words, it’s always like this but nothing is certain… You can’t say: “this is where the real revolution is happening”, not at all. There could be a reconstitution of a molecular Oedipus, and a molecular Oedipus is no better than a family Oedipus, a molar Oedipus. In fact, it can even be worse, so for example, you might have a female body that becomes the center of the gang. [_On these kinds of reconstitution, see_ A Thousand Plateaus_, pp. 214-216_]

I’m thinking of those American gangster films where the gang is led by the big mama. This is the danger the gang faces, that at its center a big black hole will begin to form. Usually this is how a gang collapses, either that or by rupture or a scattering of its members who get fed up, cross over the borderline and become part of another multiplicity, or else reconstitute a molar-type aggregate, even if it’s a small one. Once again you see how our molar-molecular distinction isn’t one between large and small numbers… [_Tape interrupted_] [1:20:47]

… I would say that leaders in molar aggregates have an organizing function. In molar aggregates we recognize the boss from the central position they occupy, the central black hole. Or, if you prefer, the face, the function of a central faciality. I’m not at all saying it’s an individual; remember that the face function is never a individual function but a social production.

So there is the central face, like that of Hitler, for example, at the center of fascism, with its little orbiting satellites, little black holes around the big black hole: Goering-Goebbels. There’s this organization, the leader is essentially in a central position, to the point that the law of molar aggregates is always, it seems to me, of a type that tends towards the center, assuring legitimate ambitions, since it’s only by advancing in one’s career that one gets closer to the center. Otherwise, one remains far from the center.

Here the center is on high because you always have a supplementary dimension in molar aggregates… there is a supplementary dimension in molar aggregates which is of course that of the profile or position of the leader. But it’s an interior and central position to which all the underlings try to get closer, except for those who are under orders to keep watch at the borders, although they’ll be relieved and their compensation will be to be able to see the leader and be led by him, that is to go back towards the center. So this is the position the leader occupies.

I’m not saying that molecular gangs or groups, molecular multiplicities, don’t have leaders, but not surprisingly we need another word to describe them. There’s one excellent word that I hadn’t thought of last term and here I open a parenthesis. I spoke about Lovecraft because he’s an author I really admire, as many of you do, this American author, American – not English. Anyway, this great American author… what was I saying? Yes, he once wrote a book, no it was a story called… and I know I won’t be able to pronounce it properly — “The Outsider”, “Outsider”, as is said “outsider”. [_See_ A Thousand Plateaus, _p. 245_] It’s translated in French, very badly as usual. Translators do things… you just need to know a little bit of a language to understand when a translation doesn’t work…. he translated the title as “Je suis d’ailleurs” (“I’m from elsewhere”).

This is important for us, for what we were saying about the becoming-animal in molecular multiplicities, quoting some passages from Lovecraft. [_On Lovecraft’s animals, see_ A Thousand Plateaus, _p. 248_] Because in this story, the _outsider_ is what Lovecraft calls “the thing”, the “unnamable”, the human being in its becoming-beast, the becoming-animal of the human. He presents the outsider both as the thing and as a swarm. Remember our couple? The guide and the pack, the two together, Moby Dick and the school of whales, the devil and the pack of wolves and so on… And we understand what _outsider_ means and that it doesn’t mean “I am elsewhere”.

So what is the outsider? Even in French I have the impression that it means, “the one you don’t expect”. But in what sense? I don’t even need to force language. Literally, it’s the one that exceeds or overflows, that arises from and spills over the border. The border-dweller, the being of the borderline is the unnamable, the one who literally delimits the swarming multiplicity. And if the multiplicity is superseded, it changes its nature and acquires another borderline. That’s what the outsider is.

I’m saying, this is the position of the leader, but “leader” from the perspective of a molecular multiplicity, which is quite different from the leader’s position in molar aggregates. Here, the leader or guide of a molecular group is the one who is always at the borderline, as in the case of animal packs, where that’s found. We’d even have to see if we didn’t find the two-fold position of the leader in certain packs, already a kind of central leader, or central female, and then the border chief, a border guide who pushes back and guards the frontier. The border chief who stays at the borderline is the great Nomad. The one who stays at the center is the Chinese Emperor, if we want to refer to literature. Operating in a completely different way the nomad is the head of his war machine, which is itself a becoming, a molecular multiplicity, whereas the Chinese Emperor is the nominal head of the State apparatus.

Although I’m here to defend thought, if someone told me that we need a leader… no, no, I’m… If I tell myself that a leader is necessary – and especially in certain circumstances, it can’t help but occur — it’s a statement that doesn’t mean much to me since, for me, the real question is what kind of leader will it be. Will it be the border-dweller, who will always occupy the position of the outsider? Or will it rather be the one who, in opposition to the outsider, we can call the “champion”, the man of central power who has a faciality function, whereas the border-dweller is typically without face, has literally lost his face? Perhaps he’s the one who makes greater use of secrets.

So, at this level too, we have to distinguish not only between two types of leader but between the way a molecular multiplicity refers to a pack leader, a peripheral chief, who we could define as an “outsider”, while molar aggregates refer to another type of leader. And we should also add that, faced with certain dangers or in certain circumstances, molecular multiplicities reconstitute leaders of the molar type and do so completely – even if they do it in a different way, depending on whether they rely on a border chief or else reconstitute a central leader typical of a molar aggregate… [_Tape interrupted_] [1:28:56]

… I find it amusing how we are presented today with the history of psychoanalysis as supposedly beginning it creation, by recounting a number of little tales about what happened inside the school. They’re still cheating, of course. There was a first period which was more or less a period of censorship concerning what happened around Freud and his early disciples. But now we can finally understand what a mess all this was, quite a marvel. It was really one of these groups with Freud was the central leader. Fine.

But what interests me, once again – this is what I wanted to say earlier — I have no interest in the disciples; the disciples deserved what they got. What interests me is what was happening on the outside during that period. I have the impression that we still don’t really know. What was happening in Vienna around the time of the birth of psychoanalysis… what psychoanalysis, as it began to institutionalize itself, crushed in the different Viennese movements.

History is normally examined purely in terms of geneses, as though on one hand you had the institution of analysis with its internal problems, and on the other a hostile external environment. But in my view this isn’t what happened. I just want to mention it… but there’s an Austrian scholar who’s been working on the matter for ten years – either he’s given up or there’s too much to say concerning the myriad groups that existed at that time. I’m not saying that Freud was plagiarizing what these groups were doing. I’m just saying that there was a flood of research. We only know of one borderline figure, Groddeck, but it seems there were many types of Groddeck around then, many, many, many. Psychoanalysis, perhaps without meaning to – without pretending to demonize it – was to crush all these movements. I can’t say it was necessarily a bad thing. I’m not saying, “Look what they did.” It rather a question of saying that’s how history always works… [_Tape interrupted_] [1:31:10]

Part III

[_Again, as with the start of the previous part, Deleuze is surrounded by a different group of students in a different classroom configuration; hence, this seems to be a third, brief segment from another seminar session, which we have situated on the following Tuesday_]

… “They [the waves] told him that every figure of space” — every figure is a multiplicity, that’s what mathematicians say; a triangle is a multiplicity on every side, on all three vertices — “They told him that every figure of space” — therefore every multiplicity — “is but the result of” — I change my tone of voice when I’m quoting — “is but the result of the intersection by a plane [of some corresponding figure of one more dimension—as a square is cut from a cube or a circle from a sphere. The cube and sphere, of three dimensions, are thus cut from corresponding forms of four dimensions that men know only through guesses and dreams; and these in turn are cut from forms of five dimensions, and so on up to the dizzy and reachless heights of archetypal infinity.] [_Tape interrupted, citation below_] [1:32:09]

… The world of men and of the gods of men is merely an infinitesimal phase of an infinitesimal thing — the three-dimensional phase of that small wholeness reached by the First Gate, where ‘Umr at-Tawil dictates dreams to the Ancient Ones.” [_This citation is from a story by H.P. Lovecraft and E. Hoffmann Price, “Through the Gates of the Silver Key” in_ The Dream-Quest of the Unknown Kadath _(New York: Ballantine Books, 1970), pp. 191-192_; _cites several times in_ A Thousand Plateaus, _see p. 251_]

You understand? We’re saying that every multiplicity, every molecular multiplicity, can be defined by a number of dimensions. This number is determined by the position of what functions as the borderline of the multiplicity. [_For this definition, see_ A Thousand Plateaus, _p. 249_] I mean to say that the square and the circle are two-dimensional figures in function of their borderline, which is to say a line. Everything that is bordered by a line will have two dimensions. These are already multiplicities. There will also be three-dimensional multiplicities bordered by a surface and multiplicities of four or five, even ten dimensions. Here are examples of a multidimensional multiplicity, however varied: man, domestic animal-sheep, rat-bacteria, which creates contagion-plague, multiplicities with three types of werewolves, three types of vampires, and so on.

So, we have multiplicities of any type of dimension that transform into one another. This we’ve already seen. What we call _plane of consistency_ or _rhizosphere_ is the common intersection of all these multiplicities by a plane. You might say, “but the plane too has its own dimension.” No. It has to be a zero-dimensional plane. Not because it doesn’t have dimensions, but because it is able to cut through all the dimensions in such a way that the multiplicities that transform into one another never cease transforming. [_Deleuze coughs_] And their way of communicating is through this plane. Therefore, on the plane of consistency everything becomes abstract, in the cultural sense of the term. That is to say, the plane of consistency is the bearer of what Félix and I have been turning around this past year: the _abstract machine_. The universe is a Mechanosphere, not a noosphere or a biosphere. It’s a hypersphere, a Mechanosphere…

What was I saying? The plane of consistency… ah yes, it’s the abstract machine because it gathers the ensemble of all the assemblages, of all machinic assemblages, of all multiplicities of whatever dimensions – and the dimensions of all these transformable multiplicities must exist precisely on this plane. The abstract elements of a single machine: a single Mechanosphere… [_Tape interrupted_] [1:36:02]

… Virginia Woolf constructs the unity of her work [_The Waves_] on a single plane of consistency that advances and gathers all the multiplicities: the Bernard multiplicity, the Neville multiplicity, the Jinny multiplicity. And we have the impression that Percival is the extreme borderline, that Percival, the admirable Percival, almost merges with the plane of consistency. And yet, no. This is not what happens although some might think so. And Percival dies. He dies. [_On_ The Waves_, see_ A Thousand Plateaus, _p. 252_]

I brought you this wonderful page of _The Waves_. One of the characters is Rhoda. Following Percival’s death, she looks into what is a kind of lake where she sees forms appearing. She has the impression that one of these forms on the lake is Percival, even if she knows he is dead. And this is what she says. She describes the form she sees: “When the white arm rests upon the knee it is a triangle; now it is upright – a column; now a fountain, falling. It makes no sign, it does not beckon, it does not see us. Behind it roars the sea. It is beyond our reach.”

Great, don’t you think? Do you see this kind of curve? The same applies when it’s upright. It passes through all these multiplicities of increasing or decreasing dimensions, of variable dimensions. But they all somehow belong to the same plane of consistency. They’re all there, on this plane of consistency, but in the most abstractly real form, in the forms of pieces and cogs of the abstract machine. So Percival’s white arm will no longer be a knee or an elbow: it will be a triangle. This will no longer be… [_Tape interrupted_] [1:38:47]

… I didn’t want to present an example from Kafka, but very quickly, I’ll tell you that she [Josephine] occupies exactly the same borderline position. What’s more, we learn that she is undoubtedly a singer, but that she doesn’t sing. [_On this Kafka tale, “Josephine the Singer, or the Mouse Folk,” see_ A Thousand Plateaus_, pp. 233-234_] These are Kafka’s flashes of brilliance. So we shouldn’t confuse becoming-musical with making music, _[Pause__]_ just as we shouldn’t confuse becoming-mouse with imitating a mouse. Man becomes mouse and mouse becomes musical, but it’s man who makes music, and what does the mouse do? It’s a mystery. We’ll follow what it does.

This is what I call a _bloc of becoming_, the simultaneity of these two asymmetrical becomings. [_On blocks of becoming, see_ A Thousand Plateaus, _pp. 237,_ 307] When I say that there is a becoming-woman of man I don’t mean that symmetrically there is a becoming-man of woman. This was already almost the objection or question that was raised the last time. When I say that there is a becoming-animal of man, somebody said there was also a becoming- human of the animal. Yes and no. In fact, there is a bloc of becoming in which both becomings, both currents, are never symmetrical or parallel. – [_Someone passes a sheet of paper to Deleuze_] This is some kind of greeting… — Never parallel, never symmetrical, and in which each becomes something different from the other.

This is extremely complicated, this business of becomings, and we’ll have to explore it further. But in the case of Kafka, there is always a strange music and there’s a precursor for this. And yet he didn’t know the music of his time well, it didn’t interest him. But there are concerts in Kafka… Josephine sings and yet she doesn’t sing. It’s magnificent… [_End of the recording_] [1:40:51]

# Lecture 2

>When Félix plays on [the term, _black hole_], and this is true of our method as a whole, what we’re formally saying is: these are not metaphors. And if we say the face, the eyes are black holes, if we say that consciousness, I-equals-I, is a black hole, then the problem is how to get out of this. As I said before: how do we break through the wall, how do we get out of the whirlpool of the hole? … We will proceed neither by metaphor nor by metonymy. We will proceed by using an inexact term to say the exact thing. Which is: the eyes, the face, consciousness… And we will say: consciousness is a black hole, the eyes are black holes and many other things besides. Memories are a black hole. 

*In a dual lecture including both Deleuze and Guattari, the authors introduce different terms developed, notably, in _A Thousand Plateaus_, plateaus 4 and 5 (on linguistics and semiotics). This session’s continuity is unfortunately marred by numerous filming breaks causing frequent jumps in the flow of ideas.With reference to work by Pierre Clastres, he emphasizes how one is rendered compatible for enunciation within the system as a whole, i.e. types of state-controlled societies and citizenship, but not necessarily within more marginalized groups, but in either case, specific formations of territorialities are involved. He proposes a rhizomatic system without black holes and yielding a semiotic polyvocality, allowing multiple expressive elements (verbal, bodily, dance, sexual), hence not informatics based but diagrammatic. Deleuze discusses in greater detail the first system, focusing particularly on different senses of “black holes” (e.g., in astronomy), to which he associates the eyes but also consciousness and memories, and then returns to the question of language-power relations and how different models have limited discussing the question, notably ideological, certain forms of linguistics. Deleuze suggests that a different conception of power is required, but one can understand language as a particular formalization of expression whose function is to transmit orders in society. Deleuze shifts position to draw a schema of three heads (information, noise, redundancy), an orders-command schema, concluding that this first system inscribes itself on a semiotic wall, that of signifiance, from which poets and writers attempt to flee. To this redundancy of frequency, he contrasts a redundancy of resonance, that he links to linguists’ use (notably, Émile Benveniste) of the term “shifter”, e.g., redundancy of the personal pronoun. This difference (to resonance) entails distinctions between the subject of enunciation and the subject of the enunciated, which Deleuze asserts are redundancies creating a vortex, a true hole.*

[_Please note that the transcription follows as exactly as possible the discussion in the filmed seminar, and therefore the translation differs at time with the discussion rendered in the subtitles on the YouTube versions_]

Félix Guattari: … to get an order of the world to function, systems of orders that order the world – the same type of promotion of invariants that constitute the co-ordinates of a single social, cosmic and affective plane…

Gilles Deleuze: Excuse me… Can everyone hear? Don’t you want to sit here? If you speak from the front everyone will be able to hear.

Guattari: So I want to return to the example you proposed of the societies studied by Clastres… [Tape interrupted] [0:48]

Guattari: … the supposed capitalisation of information through distinct units like letters, a highly purified articulation of phonemes with a policed syntax. But there’s also a whole series of semiotic components that contribute to something that isn’t a transmission of information but an expression of the libidinal life of the group. And this can express itself both through words and through mime, dance, tattoos, rituals and so on. This is what I call the different _semiotic components_.

At the end of the chain we arrive at an order whereby we can transmit something through a series of messages that are conveyed by computer. Today, to designate someone means taking a certain type of data and passing it through a computer. This will tell us not only a person’s physical location but also information about their various behaviors, degree of freedom, earning and spending power etc.  I would say that there’s been a semiotic collapse in the sense that collective modes of enunciation which inextricably wove and articulated together the various semiotic components have found themselves reduced to the point where they can always be translated in terms of a quantity of information.

The learning of language – the passage from infant to school to professional language and so on – is a process whose aim is to make individuals, however polyvocal their desires, capable of arriving at this possible reduction, which is essential to systems of production and exchange that can permit the circulation only of people who are _translatable_ in terms of information. Otherwise, they must be mad, marginals, poets and what have you. Special tools are used to treat them and they are institutionalized in facilities specifically created to deal with these marginal phenomena.

This process of semiotic collapse makes it possible nowadays to enunciate any element of one’s desires or lifeworld, provided that it is compatible with the informatics machine of the system as a whole, whether that be socialist, capitalist, bureaucratic, all the state systems – to borrow Clastres’ classification. [_On Clastres, see the A Thousand Plateaus seminar V, session 3 (November 20, 1979_] So, all of a sudden, the only subjectivity possible is that which renders you compatible with the human species in general, the species of state-controlled societies and of citizenship. Therefore, you don’t have the same rapport with the particularization of enunciations which consisted in saying…. for example, Amerindians… Amerindian tribes say that the only “people” are Amerindians, and when they see white people they say they are not “people”. Their sense of belonging to a community of expression is delimited by the place where there is a mesh of the various semiotic components.

Excuse me for this awful generalization. I know I’m taking two extremely different points in the social field. So what happens? One can submit to this system of computerized reduction only insofar as territorialities are constituted, what I call _surfaces of redundancy_, where we can articulate this type of opposition. To give an example: choosing a woman in the kind of societies described by Clastres isn’t simply a question of trying to have sex, or of reproduction, or of possessing somebody… it’s always a matter of the meeting of two social subgroups, implying different systems of exchange, systems of multiple semiotic composition.

Today, we can say that the selection of a sexual partner – which seems to be a free choice – is in fact determined by systems that compel people to correspond to specific socio-economic profiles. To the point that there are some who try to facilitate this through a computer program that matches people’s preferences. However, one no longer chooses someone from a certain clan with all that this intricate semiotic dance implies. Perhaps one no longer chooses – and here I’m jumping ahead – a body, the possession of the other’s sexual organs – if we want to define it like that – but the possibility of finding a certain type of redundancy: redundancy of survival, redundancy of faciality. We look for someone in the enunciative field that allows us to say something of the order: Tristan-Isolde, Isolde-Tristan. But in a much more sad and sinister way, as in an endless conjugal scene that consists only in the person one is talking to. [_On this topic, see_ A Thousand Plateaus, _pp. 132-133 where Deleuze and Guattari speak of redundance and conjugal love_]

When I return, announce my name, and my objective, who is it that resounds the echo of what I’m saying? On which surface of redundancy can I express myself?  In territorialized societies you have large surfaces of redundancy and multiple possibilities of semiotic composition. In the case of conjugal relations, in a deterritorialized, miniaturized subjectivity, one can only latch onto this someone and say: “Do you recognise me when I speak to you?”, “I’ll be back at such and such time”, “That’s what I’m doing”. But the same system operates with children. Even in rapports of faciality, there’s this dissociation, this type of imprinting that ethologists refer to. The rapport of visual contact, the “eye to eye” contact of which Spitz and a number of other Americans speak. [_On Spitz, see_ A Thousand Plateaus, _p. 169_]

There’s always a need to frame things. I exist only as long as there is a certain point that serves as a surface of reference and black hole where I can go on articulating my enunciations. If this last surface of redundancy or reference is taken away from me, the whole system of my informational coordinates literally collapses.

Strangely, we see that this thing psychoanalysts call the partial object — the eyes, the face, the eye-nose-mouth triangle — constitutes an extraordinary safeguard with respect to different individuals, since not only have the various semiotic components (dance, mime, gesture, group rituals and so on) largely disappeared, but also the possibility of the sexual act itself. We get to the point where one can conceive of falling in love with a trait of faciality in a woman, without having the chance to bring into play the various semiotics of love, sexuality and so on. The essential thing is that there be this last hold, this hook of territorialization. So there you have it.

The second thing we can sketch out for the moment is this: either you have informatics redundancies that latch onto surfaces with black-hole systems such as faciality, state power… In every system of power there’s always a system of black holes – the eyes of Giscard d’Estaing, the eyes of the leader… Something like, “In any case he’s one of us”, “There’s a chance, at least it’s France!”, “I recognize myself there because I’ve already seen him, I can continue speaking, producing meaning” …

Either you have this system of redundancy-black holes – which is precisely the arborescent system, because wherever there’s a black hole there are trees – and, as we said in the case of dreams, you have the dream’s umbilicus, a place where everything is organized around a central point, a blind spot. Or we can think of another system of redundancy, though in this case it wouldn’t be a redundancy of orders or of subjectivity but a _rhizomatic system_ where there is no black hole or else where the various black holes are bypassed in such a way that we return to a semiotic polyvocality – one no longer subjected to arborescence and the stratification of the various semiotic components, but where every type of expressive element (verbal, bodily, dance, sexual and so on) rather than contributing to the organization of a subject or a couple produces something that I think you (Gilles) are going to unpack, another type of semiotic organization, one that is no longer informatics-based but which we could roughly call _diagrammatic_. One that wouldn’t be centred around a black hole or pass by way of the mediation of a subject or relationship with another person, but through direct connections between the different semiotic components…  [Tape interrupted] [11:00]

Deleuze: … since these redundancies of resonance with their faciality, the traits of faciality that compose them, find their outlet, their organization, in this whirlpool system that I called _holes_… Here, Félix adds a qualification, that we should call them _black holes_. And I remind you, for those who may not know this… but then you should try to find out more for yourselves, because that’s how we can work together… I remind you that black hole is an expression taken from astronomy. What _black hole_ designates – and Félix will correct me if I’m wrong – is more or less, in the field of relativity… though it depends on which theory of relativity… it’s a star that has passed beneath its critical radius and in so doing, by diminishing this critical radius, surpassing a threshold, has acquired a strange property: it captures what are in this case photons passing nearby and retains them. It captures them and nothing gets out any more. And this is the reason that it doesn’t emit… it doesn’t emit light, it doesn’t emit photons… hence the expression _black hole_.

When Félix plays on this, and this is true of our method as a whole, what we’re formally saying is: these are not metaphors. And if we say the face, the eyes are black holes, if we say that consciousness, I-equals-I, is a black hole, then the problem is how to get out of this. As I said before: how do we break through the wall, how do we get out of the whirlpool of the hole?

It’s not a question of saying black hole in a metaphorical sense. It’s a question of stealing a word, in this case a word from astronomy, ok we’ll take it, we’ll pick it up and we’ll keep it for our own uses but not as a metaphor. We will proceed neither by metaphor nor by metonym. We will proceed by using an inexact term to say the exact thing. Which is: the eyes, the face, consciousness… And we will say: consciousness is a black hole, the eyes are black holes and many other things besides. Memories are a black hole.

As Félix said, with regard to Proust’s _madeleine_ when somebody raised the matter… “What is this business of the _madeleine_”? Félix put it admirably. He munches on his _madeleine_. It’s a redundancy, a type of redundancy perhaps. He has plunged into a black hole. The black hole of memories. How will he get out? Don’t think this is a victory for him. You recognize Proustians by the way they regard the story of the _madeleine_ as a victory. And we recognize the anti-Proustians, those who really love Proust, who suffer for him, saying “Oh no, what a mess he’s getting himself into. How is he going to get out?”

Well, he’ll get out in his own way, by making a hell of a din. He does what Félix has just said: He makes a _line of flight_ out of the black hole, he bursts, springs out from the black hole exactly the way others manage to break through the white wall, the way Gherasim Luca does. So I think that in the last part of what Guattari said what will be fundamental for us, and he will have to develop it further, is both the topic of faciality and that of black holes… [Tape interrupted] [15:00]

Deleuze: … In the conception of power that we require everyone, in a certain sense, is a messenger. You’re right, everyone’s a messenger, there’s no front line, it’s clear. So, it’s language itself that is the messenger of a pre-existing order, which nonetheless doesn’t exist outside of language.

Yolande Finkelstein: Regarding the categorization I was thinking of a parallel with what your friend whose name I don’t remember… who recites his poem…

Deleuze: Yes, I’m happy to repeat that. I would add that, not by chance, he’s called Gherasim… a well-known first name… Luca, L-U-C-A. He’s written many poems, a number of wonderful collections published by Soleil noir: _Le chant de la carpe_ (_The Song of the Carp_) and another whose title escapes me… [Tape interrupted] [16:25]

Deleuze: Today I want to begin like this. I’ve quoted some fairly unremarkable examples of redundancy. But we’re not even sure that this is redundancy. [Tape interrupted] [16:46]

Deleuze [_He reads a text apparently by André Martinet, but it is often difficult to grasp when the reading stops and when Deleuze speaks in his own voice_]: “Units of information that are independent and then probable, faced with which we are obliged to make choices. So at the other pole what is there? At the other pole you have what computer scientists call _noise_.” Already we’re wary and with good reason. We’re not doing computer science here. So it’s good to be diffident. We know that when computer scientists use the word _noise_, they’re talking about a very particular type of noise. It goes without saying that they oppose to information a noise that is presumed to be non-informative, or that contains the minimum of information, like radio or TV interference. But the noise of a beast that hides in the undergrowth is a noise that is rich in information. Even the noise of interference contains a minimum of information. For example it could be the enemy seeking to disturb a transmission. Even if we assume that it’s a random noise burst, it’s never completely fortuitous. We might consider the _pole_ noise as the opposite of the pole _maximal information_. [Tape interrupted] [18:38]

Deleuze: … Redundancy is presented as the diminution of theoretical information that is supposedly _a priori_ by right. But something else appears at the same time. Redundancy is the only way of fighting against noise. Which is to say it’s the only way to save the information from crumbling, from disintegrating into noise. [Tape interrupted] [19:23]

Deleuze: … Whether it be at the level of letters or that of phonemes makes no difference. A language contains a more or less large frequency of any given letter or a certain phoneme that it uses. For example the frequency of a given letter or phoneme are not the same in French as they are in English. So we can already begin a table of the comparative frequencies of letters or phonemes in a certain number of languages. We’ll call it a _zero-order estimation_. After which, the following estimation is already a redundancy: the frequency of a letter or phoneme in a given language.

And then there is another estimation that we can call the _first-order estimation_. This time we study the frequency of a letter in a given language with respect to the preceding or subsequent letter. In this case too, depending on the language, the frequencies are different. I’ll give you a random example. In French what is the frequency of… we could also imagine a computer performing this kind of research… What is the frequency of the group B-A? That is an A preceded by a B. We could do similar studies in the case of phonemes.

For the second-order estimation I can look for frequencies concerning three groups of letters. This series of estimations will therefore define a certain type of redundancy… [Tape interrupted] [22:20]

The diminishing of absolute theoretical information and the struggle against noise… why are these two functions linked? Nothing would prevent absolute theoretical information from falling into pure noise if there wasn’t this regulating force of redundancy, which assures the struggle against noise by diminishing the level of absolute theoretical information.

So, we have a first schema, a schema of redundancy, where at the top we will put “maximal theoretical information” and below “noise” and between the two “redundancy”. And Martinet concludes: “The presence of redundancy is a way to permit the transmission of signs”, and this happens through the series of estimations of which I just spoke. [_For this reference, see_ A Thousand Plateaus, _p. 530, note 30, to Martinet’s essay “Redondance”, in_ La linguistique, guide alphabétique _(Paris: Denoël, 1969), pp. 331-333_]

Then Martinet identifies a second type of redundancy. He says: “Not only is redundancy a way to permit the transmission of signs but there is nothing to prevent it itself from becoming a sign”. There… you see how it constitutes a sign in its own right. Redundancy not as regulator of the transmission of signs – a regulatory process in the transmission of signs, or code for transmitting information – but it itself as a sign. Why is this?

He says: “It must be so that the user can seek out the redundancy for itself.” So users can look for the actual redundancy. “A means of expression for the individual, of manifestation of group consensus. We will therefore identify a principal function of combating noise, without which any communication would be impossible”. And this is our first case of redundancy. “And then there are secondary uses,” secondary uses, “which are left at the subject’s disposal. Means of expression, of action upon others, of enchantment”… [Tape interrupted] [25:34]

Deleuze: … Reducing the second type of resonance to a secondary use of the first type may be correct from the perspective of informatics, but we’re not sure that what we are dealing with has anything to do with informatics. And perhaps we can even say that it isn’t correct from any perspective, particularly since it actually forms part of very different systems of signs: the subjective redundancies of resonance and the signifying redundancies of frequency. It’s by no means sure that they form part of the same system of signs. It’s by no means sure that the latter are simply a secondary use of the former. [_Pause_]

And there’s another thing that disturbs me and that might disturb us all, but this time it’s not related to the second type of redundancy but to what popular informatics tell us about the first schema. For the moment I’m only going to speak vaguely about this… because I’d like to focus on it later. So you can clearly see that what I want to say about redundancies is that we still aren’t even sure what all these redundancies are. So far so good… [Tape interrupted] [27:22]

Deleuze: … There’s a lot that can be said about the informative nature of language. A number of linguists have already spoken extensively about it. It’s interesting because the idea that language is by its very nature informative is one that corrupts us to such an extent that… I think of a case like that of Sartre, who at a certain point felt the need… and I don’t think he would say this now… to identify what it was that characterised language, or to be precise, poetry or literature. And he said that literature and poetry begin when there is information. Barthes too once said something similar. It’s very odd to make this kind of affirmation. [Tape interrupted] [28:21]

Deleuze: … What is it that has completely corrupted, compromised, putrefied even, the question of language-power relations? It’s the bad choice we’ve been left with, which is to say the very conception of power that has been proposed to us.  When we were told, “ah folks, it’s either infrastructure or ideology”, we were already pretty irritated. We were irritated for language’s sake, we were really irritated for language to be stuck with this alternative, even if it was presented in the most sophisticated way imaginable. Although sometimes it wasn’t presented in a very sophisticated way, yet in the end the more sophisticated the presentation the worse it turned out. Because we realised that this question of language was extremely complicated. It’s not infrastructure. No, it can’t be infrastructure. Language doesn’t produce anything. It produces only words. It doesn’t produce goods. No aspect of infrastructure coincides with language.

So, we wondered if it was rather a superstructure. In other words, is it the state apparatus that decides on language? Difficult to say.  As Stalin said: “No, we’ve changed everything but not Russian, not much at least. Of course, we’ve perfected it. But within certain limits”. So, it’s not the state apparatus. We don’t change language the way we change a constitution or a police force. So, is it ideology? “No”, he said. “It may be the vehicle of ideologies, but it can equally well be the vehicle of other things besides ideology.” So even ideology isn’t a strong candidate.

So, they said, so really, what is language? We always have to go back to this text because it’s both short and rather wonderful, the text Stalin wrote on linguistics, [_See_ A Thousand Plateaux, _p. 525, note 21,_ _in_ Marxism and Linguistics _(New York: International Publishers, 1951)_] where he says: “Comrades, you’re wrong. There are those among you who say that language is infrastructure and they are mistaken, they are not looking at the question rationally. Others say that language is ideology and there is a language of the people, a proletarian language, a bourgeois language. I say that this not the case and that you don’t really see what is at issue, comrades.”

And Stalin goes so far as to say that language is the _common good_ of a nation, and that it ensures the communication of information. It suited him to say that of course, since it implied a conception of power related to our well-known themes of infrastructure, superstructure, ideology and so on. If we were to say instead that language has always been a system of _order_ and not of information… that it is orders we are given, not information that is communicated, it would seem to us that we were saying something obvious. We turn on the TV news and what do we get? In the first place, we don’t receive information, we receive orders. And at school, what goes on? Here too it’s obvious. At school the children don’t receive information… The example of school is… Félix puts it well in a text he wrote… we put language in the mouths of children exactly the way we put shovels and picks in the hands of workers. [_See_ A Thousand Plateaux_, p. 76, for this same formulation_]

So, fine, that doesn’t mean that language is an infrastructure but that it relates to the field of orders. When the teacher gathers the children together it’s not to inform them about the alphabet, it’s to teach them a system of orders. And we have to add – and here prepared to settle our accounts with the Chomskians which we’ll have to do later [_Deleuze and Guattari undertake this in_ A Thousand Plateaus, _plateau 4, “Postulates of Linguistique”_] — that their famous phrase markers are above all markers of power. And that a syntax is a system of orders, a system of command that will allow or force individuals to form enunciations that conform to dominant enunciations. And the function of school is primarily this. So, language must be conceived first of all not in terms of information but in terms of order. Not in terms of communicating information but of transmitting orders.

Clearly, for us, this implies – and I would say this is simple and obvious – that we have to look for another conception of power, because, after all, Stalin is quite right in his remarks. There’s no one who decides syntax. Which means that power is undoubtedly something completely different to the properties of individuals or groups in a given moment. For the time being let’s just say that language is a formalization of expression. Not all expressions pertain to language. Language is a particular formalization of expression whose function is to transmit orders in a society. We know that this implies giving power another conception different from the Marxist conception. In this sense, language, including syntax, is… we can’t even call it an instrument… it’s an element and component of power. So, in this sense, it’s not informative.

And yet, in a certain way it is. Which is to say that it provides the minimal information and guides the minimum choice necessary for the correct understanding of relative, limited information, relative to the orders that are given. It goes without saying that when someone on the street shouts “There’s a fire!” (_Au feu!_), it’s better if the kids don’t understand it as “Go and play!” (_Au jeu!)._ So, there is of course information and there are choices and approximations, but which are nonetheless relative to the orders communicated by language. [_Deleuze and Guattari give this example as well as the Carroll anecdote that follows in_ A Thousand Plateaus, _p. 76_]

There’s a letter… you know how Lewis Carroll used to write letters to little girls, never to little boys. And there’s a famous letter to a little girl he wrote – which is well known and well translated so we don’t need to read it English which would be difficult for some, myself included. This admirable translation by Jacques Papy that works by equivalences, you can find in various editions of Carroll’s Letters. It describes a situation that corresponds perfectly to what we’ve been discussing. [_In fact, the translation into French is by Henri Parisot; Jacques Papy translated_ Alice in Wonderland]

During one of his lessons in a high society context, the teacher is at the bottom of the garden. And there’s a first servant who repeats his questions. Everyone knows that a teacher’s questions are really orders. When a teacher asks a panicked child what 2 and 2 are, it’s clear he’s not asking for information, he’s giving an order. And you will tell me, but the child would have to be informed first. Indeed, the child _has_ been informed by a previous system of orders. It’s always the information that presupposes the order and not the other way round. I don’t mean order in the sense of organization or ruling but in the sense of a command.

So, the first servant repeats the teacher’s question, then there is a second servant who repeats the question repeated by the first, and then a third and so on. And to mark the hierarchy that runs through language, the pupil is at the other end of the garden. And then he sends back his answer. And in Carroll’s letter, which I deliberately didn’t bring with me… you can look for it yourselves if you’re interested… the question is passed down the line, each time completely transformed, because the first servant didn’t hear properly. It begins with “what are 2 and 2”, the first servant deforms it and the question changes, the second deforms it further and the third even more. So what the pupil hears is a completely different question to which he anxiously responds, and the answer goes back up the chain.

Here we have a whole system in which the choices are always wrong but are nonetheless determined by a chain of order and command. And so the obedient response is sent back up and is more and more wrong. The conditions of information are conditions of reception of orders and commands… [Tape interrupted] [40:23]

Deleuze [_He stands in front of the blackboard, and throughout this sequence, writes the terms between each response to the students_] _The_ schema has three heads – [_Someone tosses him some chalk from the back of the room_] Thank you for the chalk — The schema has three heads — Maximal theoretical information — Noise which completely disturbs the emission and reception of information – Redundancy [_Deleuze inserts arrows between each level_] There we are. A struggle against the noise, letting us defeat the noise which diminishes at the cost of also diminishing the maximal theoretical information.

The two go well together, since without redundancy the maximal theoretical information would itself be noise. We are trying, in a crafty, underhanded way, to replace this with another schema. The orders-commands schema… You see immediately where I’m heading. I still don’t know exactly how but I feel… no, _we_ feel… we all feel, that orders-commands – I’m not saying that these are different –that orders-commands contain, comprise and in fact result to be the same thing as redundancies, that an order doesn’t need to be repeated — if we repeat an order, it’s because the order is already redundant — so, redundancy or one type of redundancy is the form of the order as such; it’s the form of command.

And generally speaking, it shouldn’t surprise us if this is the case. We shouldn’t be surprised when an order is repeated, if this is the way an order is given and received, for no other reason than to show that I have understood well. Like when someone says: “Come on, go and do such and such!” and I reply: “Yes, I’ll go and do such and such!” In this case I am superfluous. I _redund_, so to speak. But what do I _redund_? Redundancy… it’s the order itself. “Go and do such and such!” or “Go and play!” _(Au jeu!)_ no… “There’s a fire!” _(Au feu!)_ no… “Open fire!” (_En joue le feu!)_ “Open fire!” The order has to pass down the line. So the general says “Open fire!” or “Weapons at the ready!”, or something similar, and the captain says “Weapons at the ready!” and the sergeant says “Weapons at the ready!” until the order arrives at the poor guys who have to prepare their weapons. But if the order is repeated, it’s because, in itself, it is redundant. The order, the command are forms of redundancy in themselves. Maybe.

So, [_Deleuze turns to the board_] we were saying that language is not information but order or command. And we also said that the pure order, the order-command in its pure state, is pure redundancy, absolute redundancy. And this is what we put at the top of our schema. Redundancy is the same thing as an order. So, to repeat: if order becomes redundancy, if it is repeated, it is because it is in itself redundancy. So, repetition as a practice with respect to the order would simply be a consequence of redundancy as iden… [_Deleuze corrects himself_] as within the nature of the order. It’s not certain, but that’s the sensation we have… there’s nothing we can do about it.

Here, [_Deleuze writes on the board_] between the two… — the two what? I don’t know. Between the two… it’s just to make a well-balanced schema. We’ll see. — Between the two we’ll put “information”, which is always relative. If it’s true to say that redundancy is the absolute form of order, we will say that relative information is the limited content of an order in as far as it differs from another order. ABC is not the same thing as BCD. Ok, so we have relative information. You see that the form of order is absolute redundancy. So what follows is relative information. If the order didn’t communicate a piece of relative information, “Do this rather than that”, we would be in the same situation as Lewis Carroll’s teacher and pupil where we have the order that is passed down the line, an execution of the order – and an act of obedience which is completely different.

Information is merely the relative condition whereby the execution of the order corresponds to the order itself. It’s like an inversion of the informatics schema. Actually, it’s even worse. It’s a completely different field. So anyway.

Here in this third position what can I put? It’s clear, it’s obvious, it’s obvious, and it’s also clear that this is how it works. Fine. [_Deleuze writes on the board_] It’s not noise that is an informatics abstraction. [_Pause_] It’s silence. But what silence? What does that mean? Why introduce silence here? Silence. [_Pause_] Silence is ambiguous. Because it could be the state of the person who obeys – but that is a silence of language, a silence of language itself that is included in language itself. It’s [_Deleuze writes on the board_] before, it’s before… it’s what happens between the reception of the order and the response to the order. The captain says: “Load your rifle!” and what follows is a silence filled with the sound of a rifle’s bolt action. And then the soldier says: “Ready, captain”. [_Laughter_] But there’s another silence, a silence that consists in something quite bizarre: an escape [_fuite_] from all this. We know this silence. When the captain says: “Ready, take aim, fire!” [_Pause_] And there’s nothing. [_Laughter_] Silence… [Tape interrupted] [49:24]

Deleuze: … There’s no great composer who doesn’t have their techniques of silence. Here we can say something that everyone who listens to music will already be familiar with. Which is that music is traversed by a sort of vector of abolition. A vector of sonic abolition. As though it was completely intrinsic to music. The will and the movement to be extinguished [_s’éteindre_], and to extinguish us with it. Like a kind of tracing of abolition. And sounds – which are not a language, even if in music too there are orders but music flows underneath these orders that are properly musical – trace a line of abolition that is fully part of the music… and they do so in many ways.

This first system of signifying redundancy, or redundancy of frequency, inscribes itself on a semiotic wall. And the attempt to pierce this wall… we’ll call this attempt exiting from the signifier, from _signifiance_. Just as Gherasim Luca does.

And then I’ll make a brief mention of the second type of redundancy. Obviously, once again, these are not secondary uses of the first type. This time we’re dealing with redundancies of resonance. Of course, we already know something in advance: that everything mixes, everything is mixed. There are no frequencies that don’t have resonance and vice versa. So it’s not a duality, even if it would be easier to proceed as if that were the case. Though if you tell me that it’s not a duality, I’ll say, no it isn’t. But at the same time, yes it is. And if you tell me it is, I’ll say no it isn’t.  Let’s try to work things out from there.

Redundancy of resonance: what is it? As we saw, it’s not a secondary use. To use the language of linguists we would say that it’s neither a _phoneme_ nor a _morpheme_, nor is it a word. So, what are we dealing with? Not surprisingly, the last two examples of redundancy that I quoted refer to something linguists call… something we’ve talked about at length… something they call “shifter”. Which is the redundancy – I-equals-I – of the personal pronoun. And the Tristan-Isolde / Isolde-Tristan redundancy of the proper name.

And you know generally what the linguists call shifters. These are terms that designate those who are literally their bearers. The “I” designates the person who says “I”. This is not the case for other words, it’s not the case for common names. The dog in this case is not the word “dog”. But the word “I” designates the one who enunciates “I”, and we speak of this as a “shifter.” The proper name designates its bearer. Therefore, the proper name – like the personal pronoun, the “I” – are very special things that animate the second of the categories of resonance. And we’ve seen that our two examples of categories of resonance are probably closely connected – just like our two examples of categories of frequency. We have this consciousness that says “I-equals-I”, or we have this couple who say “I love you – I love you” or “I hate you – I hate you” or “I love you – I hate you” or “I hate you – I love you”. A redundancy. Or “Tristan – Isolde” … [Tape interrupted] [54:39]

Deleuze: … Is this schema the same? Once again, what we had in the first schema was: redundancy of frequency, signifier inscribed on a semiotic wall, and the problem was how to pierce this wall to arrive… at something that might no longer even be semiotics. In any case, it will be an unformulated semiotics. In the other case – here I take up a hypothesis that Guattari is currently developing… is it the same case? Perhaps, but for our purposes it’s better to make distinctions. [Tape interrupted] [55:25]

Deleuze: … This time the schema seems to me a little different. — Oops, I’ve lost the chalk… Thank you! — Tristan – Isolde. Or else we have “I-equals-I” … I would say that this time, in the redundancy of resonance, the resonance is assured by the elements in question – I and I… or in more technical terms “the subject of enunciation” and “the subject of the enunciated”. Tristan and Isolde, successively “subject of enunciation” and “subject of the enunciated” in their respective mouths. “I, Tristan, enunciate you Isolde”, but also “I Isolde enunciate you Tristan”. The subject of enunciation and the subject of the enunciated in the two cases of redundancy of resonance were as if attracted in a kind of vortex, a true hole. [_Pause, he draws a circle with a spiral within it_] They started to whirl around, to heat up inside this hole, [_Pause, he begins whispering slowly while making a circular movement with his hand_] I, I, I, I, I, I, … Tristan, Isolde, Tristan, Isolde, Tristan, Isolde, and the boat sails on, and the boat sails on, Towards what? Towards death. [_Pause_] The cogito doesn’t have a very bright future ahead of it. [_Laughter, he turns toward the board smiling_] In appearance, it’s a formally different system.

I had, and here I would like to end: redundancy of frequency, signifier operating on a wall, a semiotic wall, with the crucial question of how to break through the wall. And here I have redundancy of resonance or subjective, that refers to a hole. [_End of recording_] [58:03]
