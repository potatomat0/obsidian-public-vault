The theory was born out of years of reflection on geological and natural processes Darwin observed during his voyage on the HMSÂ <em>Beagle</em>. The work was controversial for its time. However, the processes Darwin describes inÂ <em>On the Origin of Species</em>Â were already known by numerous scientists in the 19th century. These processes had been described by various researchers prior to the book&rsquo;s publication but had not been put forth as part of a comprehensive theory. Equally, while a community of scientists endorsed Darwin&rsquo;s theory of natural selection, a portion of the scientific community had yet to accept the age of Earth. Furthermore, they rejected uniformitarianismâ€”the theory geological changes are the result of continuous and uniform processesâ€”and maintained their belief in creationismâ€”the idea all species have been created by an &ldquo;intelligent designer,&rdquo; or higher power. Darwin&rsquo;s work has remained immensely influential within the scientific community, providing the basis for much of biological and ecological work today. He remains a prominent figure in the 21st century due to his theory of evolution and its controversial implications for the idea of creationism.</p><a href=#perspective-and-narrator><h3 id=perspective-and-narrator><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Perspective and Narrator</h3></a><p>English naturalist Charles Darwin writes in the first person as he describes the theory of natural selection in a descriptive and authoritative tone inÂ <em>On the Origin of Species</em>.</p><a href=#about-the-title><h3 id=about-the-title><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>About the Title</h3></a><p><em>On the Origin of Species</em>Â is a direct reference to the subject of the workâ€”Charles Darwin&rsquo;s theory of natural selection, which argues traits advantageous to the survival of a species are those that perpetuate over time.

Darwin bases his argument largely on observations of geologic and natural processes he found to be occurring in the natural world. For instance, he notes the similarity between fossil species and modern species found in the same location. Throughout this work, he argues the idea of independent creation fails to explain the natural processes occurring on the planet. In contrast, the theory of natural selection provides explanations for all of these processes. While Darwin is the first to fully articulate natural selection as a means to create new species, he fails to provide a mechanism for how this might occur. It was not until Gregor Mendel&rsquo;s work on genetic inheritance was rediscovered that a mechanism would be identified.</p><a href=#common-ancestors><h2 id=common-ancestors><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Common Ancestors</h2></a><p>A natural extension of the theory of natural selection is the idea species, genera, and higher classes are defined by their common ancestors. These ancestral species explain why numerous species are similar to one another, why vestigial organs (body parts with no function) exist, and why island and mainland island species can have similar and distinct characteristics. This concept provides the basis for Darwin&rsquo;s argument the classification of organisms should be based on their ancestral relationships in a phylogenetic system. The idea of common ancestors is valid only if the slowness of species formation is accounted for, and recognizing the geological record is imperfect. These are both facts Darwin points out numerous times in his work. This concept laid the foundation for the phylogenetic system still in use today. However, it was also the source of much controversy. The logical extension laid out by Darwin in a later work,Â <em>The Descent of Man</em>, was that humans had also descended from a common ancestor. While this has since proven to be true (based on the work of anthropologists through the discovery of intermediate fossils connecting humans to an ancestral hominid species), at the time it was extremely controversial.</p><a href=#uniformitarianism><h2 id=uniformitarianism><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Uniformitarianism</h2></a><p>Charles Lyell&rsquo;sÂ <em>Principles of Geology</em>Â largely informs Darwin&rsquo;s work. The principle of uniformitarianism stated the same principles that shaped the earth in antiquity still take place today. Darwin applied the geological principle to biological processes as well, specifically to his theory of natural selection. He argues the same processes that resulted in the formation of past speciesâ€”seen in the fossil recordâ€”also result in the formation of species today. Using this method, Darwin can account for the slow change of species over time, rather than their sudden creation, either by catastrophic forces, or through the special act of a creator. He argues the sudden creation of some species rather than othersâ€”in contrast to the idea of slow change over timeâ€”does not explain the variation present in the natural world.</p><hr><a href=#context><h1 id=context><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Context</h1></a><a href=#scientific-predecessors-and-contemporaries><h2 id=scientific-predecessors-and-contemporaries><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Scientific Predecessors and Contemporaries</h2></a><p>In contrast to some of the earlier characterizations of this period, it is clear the idea of evolution was not conceived in a vacuum. The ideas presented inÂ <em>On the Origin of Species</em>Â build upon arguments proposed by previous and contemporary researchers who have tried to make similar issues clear. These sources of influence are clear upon readingÂ <em>On the Origin of Species</em>, asÂ 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/key-figure-analysis/#Charles_Darwin rel=noopener>Charles Darwin</a>Â makes use of these ideas in presenting his own arguments for the theory of natural selection.</p><p>While often described as an opponent ofÂ 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/author/ rel=noopener>Darwin</a>&rsquo;s theory of natural selection, 18th-century French biologistÂ 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/key-figure-analysis/#Jean-Baptiste_Lamarck rel=noopener>Jean-Baptiste Lamarck</a>Â was in fact one of the first naturalists to describe a theory of natural development in his work,Â <em>Zoological Philosophy</em>, in 1809. Lamarck&rsquo;s theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics argues a change in an organism during its life will pass directly to its offspring. While this accounts for inheritance-based change, it deviates fundamentally from Darwin&rsquo;s theory in it fails to account for the time span involved in these organismal changes. Furthermore, it only addresses change at the level of the individual, not the population.</p><p>Thomas Robert Malthus, an early-19th-century English economist, is also mentioned inÂ <em>On the Origin of Species</em>Â thanks to his work on population growth inÂ <em>An Essay on the Principle of Population</em>Â (1798). While Malthus&rsquo;s work focuses on human population growth, Darwin applies these ideas to other species as well. Darwin is particularly concerned with one of Malthus&rsquo;s ideas, known as the &ldquo;Dismal theorem,&rdquo; which recognizes human population growth, when left unchecked, will outpace available subsistence resources. While Malthus uses this point to argue for human population control, Darwin argues natural selection includes a natural mechanism for population control of nonhuman organisms. This helps explain why some species survive while others fail.</p><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/key-figure-analysis/#Charles_Lyell rel=noopener>Charles Lyell</a>Â is another early-19th-century researcher who had a direct influence on Darwin&rsquo;s thinking. Lyell&rsquo;s major work,Â <em>Principles of Geology</em>, was published in three volumes over a period of three years, from 1830 to 1833. This groundbreaking work was premised on uniformitarianismâ€”the idea the processes that shaped the earth for thousands of years are still the same processes shaping the earth today. Uniformitarianism went directly against the widely held belief the earth was shaped by cataclysmic events, such as volcanic eruptions. Not only didÂ <em>Principles of Geology</em>Â provide evidence for the age of the earth, but it also provided a sense of the continuity of time that could be applied to species.</p><p>While Darwin was formulating his theory of natural selection, the botanist monk Gregor Mendel was conducting experiments on pea plants that would lead to discoveries on genetic heredity. Mendel lectured on his experiments in 1865 and published the paper &ldquo;Experiments on Plant Hybrids&rdquo; in the journal of the Natural Science Society in BrÃ¼nn. His experiments led to what are now known as the law of segregation and law of independent assortment, both of which became the basis of modern genetic studies. While Darwin was unaware of Mendel&rsquo;s work at the time it was conducted, it provided a mechanism by which natural selection occurred. In the early 20th century, scientists and researchers combined Mendelian genetics and Darwin&rsquo;s theory of natural selection into what is now known as &ldquo;the modern synthesis,&rdquo; or neo-Darwinism. In combination with later research, it was argued population-level changes were the result of natural selection, gene flow, mutations, and population drift. The modern synthesis continues to be the accepted theory today.</p><p>Early-19th-century naturalist and biologistÂ 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/key-figure-analysis/#Alfred_Russel_Wallace rel=noopener>Alfred Russel Wallace</a>Â was one of Darwin&rsquo;s closest colleagues. While Wallace conceived an idea very similar to that of Darwin&rsquo;s theory of natural selection, he failed to receive the same public acclaim as Darwin. Having known of Darwin&rsquo;s work, Wallace sent the naturalist a letter detailing his idea. Darwin and Wallace would later give a joint presentation, but Darwin was the one to have their ideas published. Later in life, Wallace became a spiritualist, and became less convinced the idea of natural selection could account for everything.</p><a href=#hms_beagle_expedition><h2 id=hms_beagle_expedition><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>HMSÂ <em>Beagle</em>Â Expedition</h2></a><p>Darwin departed from Plymouth, England, on December 27, 1831, aboard the HMSÂ <em>Beagle</em>. The ship sailed around the tip of South America, to the GalÃ¡pagos Islands, then to New Zealand, and finally to Cape Town, Africa, before heading back to England. All told, the trip lasted five years, ending in 1836. The data Darwin gathered on this journey informed his theory of natural selection.</p><p>The trip was initiated by a letter from one of Darwin&rsquo;s professors, John Stevens Henslow, detailing how Captain Robert FitzRoy was looking for a companion for a survey on the HMSÂ <em>Beagle</em>. Darwin became FitzRoy&rsquo;s companion, as well as the ship&rsquo;s naturalist and geologist. During his voyages Darwin kept meticulous journals that would later bolster his theories. While the voyage sparked in Darwin the beginnings of his understanding of natural selection, it was not until he revisited his notes the many natural processes he observed would become clear.</p><p>Darwin was mainly concerned with understanding the geological processes he observed during the journey. This geological focus would help solidify his understanding of uniformitarianism, a process Darwin refers to over and over inÂ <em>On the Origin of Species</em>Â in order to illustrate the theory of natural selection over a broad span of time.</p><p>During his time in South America, Darwin observed a variety of unique species, geological formations, and fossils that added to his ideas involving the history of unique structures (such as the blind tuco-tuco) and ancestral species (such as in the fossils of extinct armadillos).</p><p>From South America Darwin traveled to the location he is most associated with today, the GalÃ¡pagos Islands. It is here he observed the variation in finch beak structure that led him to conclude years later they had adapted to different feeding methods. The latter portions of his journey to New Zealand reinforced his emphasis on Lyell&rsquo;s theory of uniformitarianism and provided experiences he would later draw on for his workÂ <em>On the Origin of Species</em>.</p><a href=#modern-influence><h2 id=modern-influence><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Modern Influence</h2></a><p>By the time of Darwin&rsquo;s death, the idea of evolution was fairly universally accepted. However, the specifics were still debated and under scrutiny. In contrast to the theory of natural selection, many were convinced evolution was working toward a particular purpose. Darwin&rsquo;s work provided the impetus for the end of the idea of rational design in scientific endeavors. This shift was not immediate, but occurred over many years. While creationism has remained a popular idea, this is only the caseÂ <em>outside</em>Â the scientific community.</p><p>Darwin&rsquo;s ideas have not remained static but have been reinterpreted and incorporated with new data. The first major incorporation was with Darwin and Mendel&rsquo;s work on genetic heredity. Even after the rediscovery of Mendel&rsquo;s experiments, many were not convinced Mendel&rsquo;s and Darwin&rsquo;s ideas were compatible. However, in 1942 Ernst Mayr and Julian Huxley publishedÂ <em>Systematics and the Origin of Species</em>Â andÂ <em>Evolution: The Modern Synthesis</em>, a work that attempted to translate genetic factors into testable field hypotheses.</p><p>Unfortunately, some racist ideas spawned from Darwin&rsquo;s theory, mainly social Darwinismâ€”or the idea some human races were more &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; than others. This misconception would provide the rationalization for racial discrimination and imperialist policies during the 19th and 20th centuries. Despite the use of Darwin&rsquo;s name, social Darwinism has no connection to the theory of natural selection as described by Darwin himself. Rather, it is a misconception of his ideas applied to the common perception at the time that organism-level change was characterized by progression toward a specific ideal.</p><p>Today, Darwin is considered one of the most influential scientists because of his role in changing both the scientific and public perception of biological processes. Not only did he bring the concept of antiquity into the biological sciences, but he did so in a systematic way. His arguments were based on qualitative descriptions of field experiences that would pave the way for more quantitative descriptions. While today deductive methodology is argued to be the most useful for understanding scientific processes, Darwin&rsquo;s inductive methodology represents the first attempt to systematically describe the processes influencing biological variation.</p><hr><a href=#key-figures><h1 id=key-figures><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Â Key Figures</h1></a><table><thead><tr><th>Key Figure</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Charles Darwin</td><td>Darwin was a 19th-century English geologist and naturalist.

He structures his argument by framing his ideas within the research of his predecessors and contemporaries, ending with the foundational thesis of the novelâ€”species are modified through natural selection.</p><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/author/ rel=noopener>Darwin</a>Â begins his argument with the premise that a large degree of the variability in species is due to humankind&rsquo;s &ldquo;domestic production.&rdquo; He says species and varieties are ill defined, and natural selection occurs in wild species as well as domestic. He explains what he sees as the driving force behind the natural selection of wild animalsâ€”the struggle for existence. He defines natural selection as the preservation of adaptive traits at the expense of nonadaptive traits. In order to illustrate his ideas, Darwin refers to a drawing he uses to detail the evolution of organisms across space and time. After describing the theory of natural selection, he attempts to describe the &ldquo;laws of variation,&rdquo; noting the role of the environment and sexual selection. However, he concludes little is known about these laws.</p><a href=#addressing-oppositions><h3 id=addressing-oppositions><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Addressing Oppositions</h3></a><p>Darwin then addresses various objections against the theory of natural selection, such as the lack of transitional forms, difficulties of the emergence of unique forms, and the selection for complex organs. He also specifically addresses objections raised by specific scientists: paleontologist Heinrich Bronn, botanist Karl Wilhelm von NÃ¤geli, and zoologist St. George Jackson Mivart, among others. From here he dedicates two chapters to a discussion of how natural selection informs not only physical characteristics, but also instinct, and why some of the interbreeding of two species will often produce infertile hybrids.</p><a href=#the-geological-record><h3 id=the-geological-record><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Geological Record</h3></a><p>Darwin moves on to a discussion of how natural selection is informed by the geological record. He addresses three important points for understanding natural selection using the geologic record: the record was formed over a great period of time; the record is imperfect due to the shifting of the crust and variations in how geological strata are formed; and not all animals are able to become fossils. These facts create biases in the record Darwin emphasizes must be accounted for. Even so, he finds the geologic record to be an apt record of transitional forms and of the slow change of species overtime.</p><p>Darwin then explains geological distribution, as it pertains to the extinct ancestors of many species and genera. He begins with three main points: the distribution of species across the globe cannot be accounted for when considering &ldquo;climatal and other physical conditions&rdquo; alone; the distribution of species is related to the presence of physical barriers; and there is a similarity of species across continents at different geographical points. These points refer both to terrestrial, oceanic, and island patterns.</p><a href=#classification-based-on-natural-selection><h3 id=classification-based-on-natural-selection><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Classification Based on Natural Selection</h3></a><p>Darwin then transitions into a description of the flaws in the current species&rsquo; classification system. He proposes the classification of organisms should be based on ancestral descent and sees this as the most obvious form of classification when considered part of the theory of natural selection. He ends the book by reiterating he does not find natural selection to be the only means by which variations in organisms occur. However, he posits it is theÂ <em>main</em>Â form by which variation occurs. He notes the main reason why individuals may fail to consider the theory of natural selection is people are &ldquo;slow in admitting great changes&rdquo; when the process is not immediately apparent.</p><hr><a href=#introduction--summary><h1 id=introduction--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Introduction | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-2><h2 id=summary-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/author/ rel=noopener>Darwin</a>Â begins by framing his work within the context of his voyage aboard the HMSÂ <em>Beagle</em>, stating the conclusions he reached are the result of his personal observations. However, he clarifies the conclusions presented in this work are preliminary. He was advised to publish his ideas after receiving a manuscript from Alfred Wallace containing similar deductions.</p><p>Darwin bases his argument on research undertaken by his predecessors and contemporaries. He argues naturalists are aware new species rise from other species. However, he points out most scientists ascribe this fact to &ldquo;external conditions,&rdquo; such as &ldquo;climate&rdquo; and &ldquo;food.&rdquo; Darwin argues these are not the only means for the origins of new species.</p><p>Darwin goes on to detail the general structure of the rest of the book. He will first discuss domesticationâ€”or variation in species caused by humankindâ€”followed by a discussion of variation in nature, the difficulties of survival, natural selection, the laws of variation, and finally the &ldquo;apparent and gravest difficulties in accepting the theory.&rdquo; Darwin ends the introduction with a clear thesis: &ldquo;Natural Selection has been the most important, but not the exclusive, means of modification&rdquo; in animal species.</p><a href=#analysis><h2 id=analysis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p>WhileÂ 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/author/ rel=noopener>Darwin</a>Â emphasizes the preliminary nature of the conclusions presented inÂ <em>On the Origin of Species</em>, the strength of his argument has held up thanks to the longevity his work has enjoyed since its publication in 1859. The fundamental principles Darwin discusses in the following chapters of the book set the foundation for modern scientific research in biology, ecology, and genetics.</p><p>Darwin admits part of the push for publishing this work was Wallace&rsquo;s manuscript. While scientific advancements often occur because of friendly competition, it is rarely stated so plainly within the introduction of the work itself. While Darwin was eager to publish on the idea of natural selection, it is clear he was willing to work with Wallace to some extent. Indeed, the first public presentation of the theory of natural selection was authored by both Darwin and Wallace and given as a joint talk to the Linnean Society in 1858. However, Darwin aimed to publish on this idea before Wallace and was able to do so successfully. It is perhaps unsurprising that despite the fact the theory of natural selection was conceived of independently by both Darwin and Wallace, it is Darwin&rsquo;s name that is often the only one associated with it.</p><p>This touches on a couple of themes within scienceâ€”the first being scientific advances are rarely conceived of in a vacuum. Ideas are most often a product of a culmination of ideas, and thus are subject to independent invention by multiple individuals in the field. The other theme within the sciences is the tendency for specific individuals to be recognized for an idea conceived by many. Despite the fact Wallace conceived of the idea of natural selection at the same time as Darwin, he is often not recognized for his work.</p><hr><a href=#chapter-1--variation-under-domestication--summary><h1 id=chapter-1--variation-under-domestication--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 1 : Variation Under Domestication | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-3><h2 id=summary-3><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/author/ rel=noopener>Darwin</a>Â states a large degree of the variability in species is due to humankind&rsquo;s &ldquo;domestic production.&rdquo; He argues the cultivation of crops and animals for food inherently causes variation. He claims there are two ways variation occurs: directly on the organism or through reproduction.</p><p>Darwin argues this indirectâ€”or &ldquo;indefinite&rdquo;â€”variation accounts for why offspring will have traits neither parent possesses. He states over many generations, these individual variations can result in &ldquo;monstrosities&rdquo;â€”variation between species of the same genera, and especially between the domestic and non-domestic varieties. These indirect variations can be seen most vividly in domestic plants and animals.</p><p>Despite his emphasis on reproductive variation, Darwin returns to the topic of direct variation and discusses how &ldquo;changed habits produce an inherited effect&rdquo; in a species. He provides a variety of examples, such as the differences in bone weight of the domestic and wild duck. He discusses the idea of &ldquo;correlated variation,&rdquo; or the idea changes in certain traits automatically result in changes in others. He argues correlated variation is the reason human domestication can often result in the unexpected modification of certain traits. Darwin then describes the variation in domesticated pigeons to illustrate his ideas.</p><p>Darwin argues the main benefit of domesticated races is the appearance of features beneficial to humankind. He distinguishes between two forms of selection: methodological and unconscious. Methodological selection refers to the predetermined effort to select certain traits within an animal species with the goal of creating a new breed for a specific purpose. In contrast, unconscious selection refers to the unintended selection of certain traits in a species. The conclusion returns to Darwin&rsquo;s original thesis statement, arguing the main cause of domestication was due to &ldquo;the accumulative action of Selection, whether applied methodically and quickly, or unconsciously and slowly.&rdquo;</p><a href=#analysis-1><h2 id=analysis-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/author/ rel=noopener>Darwin</a>Â begins his discussion of natural selection by addressing the popular idea a change in species can occur on the organismal level. The oft-used example is the long neck of the giraffe is the result of individual organisms stretching to obtain leaves from increasingly taller trees. However, it is impossible for individual changes that occur over an organism&rsquo;s lifetime to be transferred to their offspring. For instance, an organism that breaks their leg will not have an offspring with a similarly broken leg.</p><p>According to Darwin, the only form of natural selection is the second way variation can occur: through sexual reproduction. In order to support his theory, he uses the remainder of the chapter to illustrate various examples of how traits not present in either parent can appear and disappear in their offspring.</p><p>Darwin discusses the ability of domesticated animals to revert to their pre-domesticated state. He claims different domestic races or breeds that revert are part of the same species. This is the primary means for defining species, as dictated by Carl Linnaeus, who developed the categorization system of families, genera, and species still in use today. More recently, with the advent of genetic research, scientists have shifted to categorizing species based not on their physical characteristics but on their genetic similarities.</p><p>Despite the change in species categorization due to technological and theoretical advances in gene studies, Darwin&rsquo;s work represents the first systematic attempt to identify variations in species. In his final paragraph, he discusses two forms of animal and plant domestication: purposeful and directional, and unintended. Today, it is believed the initial domestication of plants and animals by early human populations was due to a combination of both types of domestication.</p><hr><a href=#chapter-2--variation-under-nature--summary><h1 id=chapter-2--variation-under-nature--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 2 : Variation Under Nature | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-4><h2 id=summary-4><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p>In the second chapter,Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/author/ rel=noopener>Darwin</a>Â starts by defining some of the terms he introduced in the first chapter to set up his argument that species and varieties are ill defined. He explains numerous definitions exist for what is a &ldquo;species,&rdquo; or a &ldquo;variety.&rdquo; As a result the definitions are &ldquo;vague and arbitrary.&rdquo; While in general he notes variations in species occur slowly as different traits are inherited, he is unclear if monstrositiesâ€”the sudden appearance of a traitâ€”can be passed on. This could be considered what is today known as a mutation, or the sudden appearance of a trait that may or may not provide adaptive benefits, and thus may or may not be transferred to the following generation.</p><p>Darwin dedicates the remainder of the chapter to distinguishing between species and varieties. He begins by stating naturalists define these terms in numerous ways. In order to understand how these terms should be defined, it is necessary to study &ldquo;individual differences&rdquo; inherited within a population. Quantifying the degree of difference is thus important in distinguishing between varieties (with small degrees of difference) and species (with large degrees of difference).</p><p>In order to quantitatively describe the differences between species and varieties, Darwin evaluated &ldquo;all the varieties in several well-work floras.&rdquo; From this data set, he is able to show genera with more &ldquo;species&rdquo; or &ldquo;varieties&rdquo; have a smaller degree of variationâ€”and thus should be considered varietiesâ€”than genera with relatively fewer &ldquo;species&rdquo; or &ldquo;varieties.&rdquo; These larger genera continue to diversify at a faster rate than smaller genera, and Darwin argues these patterns would not be present if &ldquo;we look at each species as a special act of creation.&rdquo;</p><a href=#analysis-2><h2 id=analysis-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p>The second chapter moves from the larger-scale description of domesticated animals to a detailed look at what constitutes a species.Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/author/ rel=noopener>Darwin</a>Â is using this to set up his argument for describing natural selection in wild animal populations. He states while selection in domesticated animals makes more sense, the application of natural selection to wild animal populations requires more explanation.</p><p>The question of what constitutes a species is a question that continues to garner attention in scientific literature. While specific arguments have changed, the rationale remains relatively the same. Darwin&rsquo;s treatment of the termÂ <em>species</em>Â is one of the first quantitative treatments aimed at defining it. He later notes inÂ 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/chapter-14-summary/ rel=noopener>Chapter 14</a>Â other researchers were arbitrarily defining species as those who had been designed by the &ldquo;Creator&rdquo; and varieties as those that varied due to other processes. He argues these definitions should be treated more rigorously.</p><p>Darwin&rsquo;s evaluation of species-level variations within genera is not inherently different from work completed by previous naturalists. He notes the variation inherent in the categorization of different species into &ldquo;species&rdquo; or &ldquo;variety&rdquo; categories even when looking at the same data set. However, he is attempting to quantify these differences and base them on a more measureable standard than their creation by the &ldquo;Creator.&rdquo;</p><p>What makes Darwin&rsquo;s work unique is his qualitative evaluation of what constitutes a species, along with his statement the patterns of variation he is seeing should not be expected if species were viewed as acts of creation. At the timeÂ <em>On</em>Â <em>the Origin of Species</em>Â was written, this would have been an extremely controversial statement. Even scientists who accepted the idea of evolution were reluctant to attribute species-level variations to a process other than creationism.</p><hr><a href=#chapter-3--struggle-for-existence--summary><h1 id=chapter-3--struggle-for-existence--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 3 : Struggle for Existence | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-5><h2 id=summary-5><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p>After attempting to further define the termÂ <em>species</em>,Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/author/ rel=noopener>Darwin</a>Â moves on to what he sees as the driving force behind the natural selection of wild animalsâ€”the struggle for existence. He states Herbert Spencer&rsquo;s term,Â <em>survival of the fittest</em>, can be applied to this concept. It is simply the struggle for existence as it affects an organism and their potential for offspring, and thus affects a species on a population level.</p><p>Darwin argues the struggle for existence stems from the geometrical rate of population increase. Thomas Robert Malthus first applied this idea to human populations, and Darwin argues mechanisms to keep population growth in check must exist. Otherwise, populations will outpace the environment&rsquo;s capacity to support them.</p><p>Darwin describes different methods that keep a population in check: the propensity for death in young or juveniles; the ability to obtain food, or being food for another species; climatic effects; and epidemics. He emphasizes in general, the environment is sustained by a series of checks and balances. He illustrates this principle using changes in the ecological composition of a heath (an open area of uncultivated land) following the introduction of one new tree speciesâ€”the Scotch fir. He notes massive changes in both the floral and faunal communities, and goes on to marvel at individuals who are surprised when creatures go extinct. Equally, Darwin posits domesticated animals may be unable to survive if returned to their wild habitat.</p><p>Darwin ends with an important observationâ€”the struggle for existence influences the natural selection of wild species. &ldquo;The struggle will generally be more severe between&rdquo; species within the same genera than between species from different genera. It is this competition that results in subtle variations, which lead to the formation of distinct species.</p><a href=#analysis-3><h2 id=analysis-3><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p>One of the statements most often associated withÂ 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/author/ rel=noopener>Darwin</a>Â today is natural selection is the product of the &ldquo;survival of the fittest.&rdquo; However, it was Herbert Spencer, a 19th-century British philosopher, who originally coined the phrase. The term is often misunderstood as survival of the fittestÂ <em>individual</em>. However, when applied to the theory of natural selection, it refers to the survival of the fittest on theÂ <em>population</em>Â orÂ <em>species</em>Â level.</p><p>Darwin&rsquo;s argument for why the struggle for existence occurs is based on the work of Thomas Robert Malthus, an English economist who theorized population growth will outpace the available food supply. His ideas were published in 1798 inÂ <em>An Essay on the Principle of Population</em>. While Malthus argued for population control to limit the pressures of human populations, Darwin argues for the presence of natural population controls as it pertains to animal populations.</p><p>Darwin&rsquo;s description of the changes to a heath due to the introduction of the Scotch fir is important because of the implications of his observations. Today, ecologists and scientists know the ecology of a specific region is immensely sensitive to subtle shifts in the floral or faunal population. This is one of the major issues plant and animal populations are facing today due to climatic changes. As the temperature of the earth changes, plants and animals that adapted to a specific region are being placed in conditions that do not fit their evolutionary adaptations. As a result, they are no longer able to exist in that region. In contrast to other contemporary scientists, Darwin&rsquo;s recognition that life is highly susceptible to extinction is a fact that even today, portions of the general public struggle to understand.</p><p>Equally, Darwin&rsquo;s comment regarding the potential inability of domesticated animals to survive in their wild habitats has since proven to be true. For instance, while this is not the case for all domesticated animals, domesticated cows would suffer if left without farmers, due to the selection for their overproduction of milk.</p><hr><a href=#chapter-4--natural-selection-or-the-survival-of-the-fittest--summary><h1 id=chapter-4--natural-selection-or-the-survival-of-the-fittest--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 4 : Natural Selection; Or the Survival of the Fittest | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-6><h2 id=summary-6><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p>In this chapterÂ 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/author/ rel=noopener>Darwin</a>Â describes how the principle of natural selection applies not only to domesticated animals but also to wild animals. Darwin begins by defining natural selection, or survival of the fittest, as the &ldquo;preservation of favorable individual differences and variations, and the destruction of those which are injurious.&rdquo;</p><p>He initiates his argument on the premise environmental change results in variability of species. Thus, in contrast to domestication, natural selection on wild animals can act on &ldquo;the whole machinery of life.&rdquo; The correlation of traitsâ€”so that a change in one trait results in a corresponding change in anotherâ€”contributes to the possibility of a large degree of variation.</p><p>Darwin describes how natural selection affects &ldquo;the structure of the young in relation to the parent,&rdquo; thus altering the structure of a &ldquo;whole community.&rdquo; Natural selection is a population-level processâ€”individual variations result in large-scale changes. He emphasizes natural selection operates only to provide beneficial adaptations. Thus, while negative variations can emerge at the individual level, they will not persist to the population level unless they provide an adaptive quality. Darwin then provides a specific section on sexual selection, arguing it is similar to natural selection in its processes, but &ldquo;less rigorous.&rdquo; He defines sexual selection as the situation where &ldquo;one sex [is] modified in relation to the other sex.&rdquo;</p><p>Darwin provides two examples of the ability of natural selection to operate on wild animals: the hunting ability of wolves, and the coevolutionary relationship between bees and flowers. After describing these two examples in detail, Darwin notes his examples are susceptible to objections similar to those raised inÂ 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/key-figure-analysis/#Charles_Lyell rel=noopener>Charles Lyell</a>&rsquo;s work,Â <em>Principles of Geology</em>. However, he argues these objections have been mainly falsified for geological processes and thus should not be applied to biological processes.</p><p>Darwin then explains genetic variation in a species is advantageous, as &ldquo;close interbreeding diminishes vigor and fertility.&rdquo; This serves to increase the amount of variation in a species and acts as a driving process for natural selection. Isolation also serves to drive natural selection through the decrease of genes in the gene pool. In contrast, a large area also serves to promote variation and natural selection processes. He concludes this section with the statement: &ldquo;Natural selection generally acts with extreme slowness.&rdquo;</p><p>This &ldquo;slowness&rdquo; makes it possible to identify natural selection and extinctions in the geological record. Darwin describes in the following section how natural selection results in extinctions. This ties into the branch diagram at the end of the chapter Darwin uses to illustrate the creation of new species, genera, and families over time and space.</p><p>Following this section, Darwin touches on the idea of advancement in natural selection. He notes scientists have posited there is a &ldquo;gradual advancement&rdquo; of organisms in the world. However, he argues the evidence for this is not sufficient, based on the principles of natural selection or the organization of organisms.</p><p>Before providing a summary of the chapter, Darwin touches on two ideas: convergence and the issue of infinite species. The first, convergence, refers to a &ldquo;similarity of structure&rdquo; of distinct species. The second refers to the question Darwin first alludes to in a previous chapter: &ldquo;What then checks an indefinite increase in the number of species?&rdquo; Darwin argues it is the carrying capacity of the environment, and the rapid process of species extinction, in contrast to the relatively slow process of natural selection.</p><a href=#analysis-4><h2 id=analysis-4><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p>This chapter contains the bulk ofÂ 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/author/ rel=noopener>Darwin</a>&rsquo;s argument natural selection is the driving factor behind species formation in not only domesticated animals but in wild animals as well. Darwin also explains what is meant by the termÂ <em>survival of the fittest</em>. While this term was brought up in the previous chapter, it was not fully explained. In this chapter Darwin details how the term refers not just to individual survival, but how the survival of many individuals results in the relative survival of a population or species.</p><p>Darwin goes on to describe sexual selection as distinct from natural selection. However, today sexual selection is seen as a form of natural selection. Males who are able to attract a greater number of females are those who will pass on similar traits. These traits over time result in population-level changes, and can result in variations within a species.</p><p>Darwin briefly mentions objections raised in Lyell&rsquo;s work,Â <em>Principles of Geology</em>. Here he is referring to the objections raised by a group of scientists who promoted the idea &ldquo;catastrophism&rdquo;â€”massive cataclysmic events, such as volcanic eruptions, that cause species extinctionâ€”resulted in the geological formations seen today. Darwin argues these same large-scale processes can be argued for the speciation of animals (process of biological species formation), but, as has been proven to be the case with geological processes, speciation does not occur over these short time periods. Darwin ties this to the idea of species extinctions, arguing the processes of natural selection that result in the origination of new species are the same ones that result in species extinctions. He notes these long-term processes can be seen in the geological record.</p><p>Darwin also touches on the idea of &ldquo;advancement&rdquo; through natural selection. He argues natural selection is not based around the &ldquo;advancement&rdquo; of a species. However, this idea is one that would later be misrepresented as &ldquo;Social Darwinism.&rdquo; While Darwin himself did not promote the idea that certain &ldquo;races&rdquo; were more &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; than others, some would apply the idea of natural selection to subjugate and degrade human populations throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.</p><p>Finally, one of the main contributions of this chapter is Darwin&rsquo;s cladogram (branch diagram used in science). The cladogram is based on an unnamed or hypothetical genus, but Darwin goes on to connect it to a metaphorical tree of life. While some have argued over the inaccuracy of the tree of life metaphor, there is no denying the impact it has had in the popular belief in evolution and natural selection. Throughout the book, Darwin refers to this figure to visually represent the concepts involved with the theory of natural selection.</p><hr><a href=#chapter-5--laws-of-variation--summary><h1 id=chapter-5--laws-of-variation--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Â Chapter 5 : Laws of Variation | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-7><h2 id=summary-7><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p>InÂ

<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/author/ rel=noopener>Darwin</a>Â is concerned with describing the laws of variation, although he admits &ldquo;our ignorance &mldr; is profound.&rdquo; He begins by noting environmental conditionsâ€”such as food and climateâ€”play a role in variation, and likely natural selection. However, the degree of this role is unclear. He argues the relative amount of use or disuse of a part results in changes due to natural selection. He cites numerous examples, including cave animals who, due to the lack of use of their eyes, have gone blind. He also notes there are changes in species and variations resulting from acclimatization. Different species within the same genus can often be found in very different climates. Darwin attributes some of this variation to changes related to natural selection.</p><p>Darwin notes there are multiple competing factors at play that are likely the result of patterns he sees in species variation. Some of these factors include: the &ldquo;tendency to reversion,&rdquo; the &ldquo;tendency to new variations,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;power&rdquo; of maintaining stasis within a species. He argues the large degree of random variation makes sense only in the context of natural selection, in contrast to the traditional explanation of &ldquo;each species having been independently created.&rdquo;</p><p>Darwin goes on to address the variability in secondary sexual characteristics. A high degree of variation in these traits may occur within the same species, and independent species may develop analogous traits. He points to the domestic pigeon, noting multiple breeds develop similar traits seemingly independently. He ends the chapter by stating the laws of variation should become clearer through the descriptions of various genera and species.</p><a href=#analysis-5><h2 id=analysis-5><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p>In this chapterÂ 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/author/ rel=noopener>Darwin</a>Â is attempting to determine the mechanism for variations and natural selection. He admits he is unsure of the fundamental cause, but presents a wide variety of examples and descriptions in an attempt to elucidate some general laws. Interestingly, the cause of these patterns was determined at approximately the same timeÂ <em>On</em>Â <em>the Origin of Species</em>Â was initially published in 1859. In 1865 Gregor Mendel published his famous experiment involving crossbred pea plants that confirmed the mechanism of natural selection to be genetic inheritance. However, it would not be until after 1900 that scholars would rediscover Mendel&rsquo;s work and combine it with Darwin&rsquo;s theory of natural selection.</p><p>It is now known the variations Darwin describes in this chapter are all controlled by genes through a combination of processes: the law of segregation, the law of independent assortment, and the law of dominance. Together, these &ldquo;Laws of Heredity&rdquo; explain a large proportion of the variation Darwin describes in this chapter. For example, the reemergence of traits that have seemingly fallen out of the gene pool of a particular species could be due to the phenotypic expression of recessive traits.</p><p>In this chapter Darwin also discusses the &ldquo;law of compensation.&rdquo; Mathematician Johann Goethe and naturalist Ã‰tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire formulated this law, which states changes in one structure of an organism are correlated with a reduction in the function of another structure. This argument places a great deal of emphasis on the form of a structure in contrast to its function. Not only does Darwin argue his theory of natural selection goes against the traditional view of function over form, but he offers evidence the traditional view of independent creation does not explain the variation inherent in the natural world. These two ideas exemplify some of the reasons why Darwin was hesitant to publish on this topicâ€”they were at the core of some of the arguments against the theory of natural selection after the initial publication ofÂ <em>On the Origin of Species</em>.</p><hr><a href=#chapter-6--difficulties-of-the-theory--summary><h1 id=chapter-6--difficulties-of-the-theory--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Â Chapter 6 : Difficulties of the Theory | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-8><h2 id=summary-8><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/chapter-6-summary/ rel=noopener>Chapter 6</a>Â is focused on addressing the potential objections toÂ 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/author/ rel=noopener>Darwin</a>&rsquo;s theory of natural selection. The chapter deals specifically with three issues: the lack of transitional forms; difficulties of the emergence of unique forms (such as the bat); and the selection for complex organs (such as the eye).</p><p>Regarding the lack of transitional variations of species, Darwin argues the time depth (period in which genetic development is at play) involved with natural selection, the incompleteness of the geological record, the fact that natural selection acts on variation by selecting beneficial adaptations, and the wide geographical ranges of species result in relatively few transitional forms. He notes while the examples of transitional forms are few because of some of the issues he discussed in the previous section (such as the extended timeframe by which natural selection operates), it is not difficult to conceptualize the links that formally existed, such as connecting mammals with similar structuresâ€”the flight membranes of the flying squirrel, the flying lemur, and the bat. He notes these variations could arise in species &ldquo;following habits different from those proper to their species.&rdquo;</p><p>Darwin argues that &ldquo;organs of little apparent importance&rdquo; could represent structures that were originally important to the species, but have since become unimportant. These organisms would then represent &ldquo;transitional&rdquo; forms, or at least &ldquo;transitional&rdquo; structures. He then addresses the argument certain structures of species are the results of the selection for beauty. He argues the definition of beauty is inherently subjective. In cases where a structure can be considered beautifulâ€”such as in a strawberry, or in the plumage of a male birdâ€”it is the case these structures have evolved to serve a specific function. In the case of the fruit, it is to spread its seeds, and in the case of the bird it is to attract a mate.</p><a href=#analysis-6><h2 id=analysis-6><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p>In this chapterÂ 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/author/ rel=noopener>Darwin</a>Â is attempting to address some of the issues that have already been raised regarding his theory of natural selection.</p><p>Even while Darwin was writingÂ <em>On the Origin of Species</em>, researchers such as Fritz MÃ¼ller and Ã‰douard ClaparÃ¨de were providing independent evidence for Darwin&rsquo;s theory. MÃ¼ller was a German naturalist who began corresponding with Darwin after sending him a book titledÂ <em>FÃ¼r Darwin</em>Â (1865). His work focused on crustaceans. Similarly, Ã‰douard ClaparÃ¨de was a Swiss anatomist who focused on parasitic mites. In both cases these individuals argued the variations they were seeing could only be due to natural selection.</p><p>At the end of the chapter, Darwin states it is only by natural selection the phrase &ldquo;Natura non facit saltum&rdquo; has truth. This phrase translates to, &ldquo;nature makes no leap,&rdquo; a long-held canon in the studies of natural history. The term was originally used by English naturalist John Ray (1682) to refer to the idea species existed in gradations. Here, Darwin uses the phrase slightly differently. He does not see species as existing in gradationsâ€”one transitioning into anotherâ€”but rather as distinct groups. He is instead referring to the idea natural selection occurs slowly, and only over long periods of time are new species formed.</p><hr><a href=#chapter-7--miscellaneous-objections-to-the-theory-of-natural-selection--summary><h1 id=chapter-7--miscellaneous-objections-to-the-theory-of-natural-selection--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 7 : Miscellaneous Objections to the Theory of Natural Selection | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-9><h2 id=summary-9><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/author/ rel=noopener>Darwin</a>Â dedicates this chapter to addressing objections raised by scientists in previous versions ofÂ <em>On the Origin of Species</em>, this version being the last. He specifically addresses objections raised by three individuals: paleontologist Heinrich Bronn, botanist Karl Wilhelm von NÃ¤geli, and zoologist St. George Jackson Mivart. In Darwin&rsquo;s opinion the &ldquo;more serious objection&rdquo; is the presence of traits that seemingly have no benefit to the specimen. Darwin addresses this issue throughout the previous chapter in depth. However, in this chapter he raises the idea of the &ldquo;laws of growth,&rdquo; which include all non-environmental factors that influence natural selection. While he argues the theory of natural selection is the main source of variation in species, these other factors could be causing the variations seen by other researchers. He discusses again the idea of development toward perfection, as posited by NÃ¤geli in his &ldquo;doctrine of &mldr; progressive development,&rdquo; and reiterates nature is not concerned with progression.</p><p>Darwin addresses Mivart&rsquo;s objections, such as the long neck of the giraffe, insects that &ldquo;imitate various objects,&rdquo; and the formation of a prehensile tail, among others. In all cases Darwin reiterates arguments made in the previous chapters to lay these objections to rest. In his conclusion Darwin notes, &ldquo;Almost all naturalists [including Mivart himself] admit evolution under some form.&rdquo; However, he notes the difference is in the degree to which other naturalists see evolution as being a driving force for variation and understanding how evolution is accomplished. Darwin is arguing evolution is the driving force for variation, and it is accomplished through natural selection. However, many individuals at the time saw creationism as the main factor in the creation of species.</p><a href=#analysis-7><h2 id=analysis-7><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p>This chapter is largely a reiteration of many ofÂ 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/author/ rel=noopener>Darwin</a>&rsquo;s points made earlier in the book. In this case, however, he is responding to objections raised by members of the scientific community who had read earlier versions ofÂ <em>On the Origin of Species</em>. While he addresses objections raised by a variety of researchers, his main focus is on rebuffing Mivart&rsquo;s arguments.</p><p>Mivart was an English biologist and an outspoken critic of Darwin&rsquo;s theory of natural selection. Darwin notes he was thorough in &ldquo;collecting all the objections which have ever been advanced by myself and others against the theory of natural selection.&rdquo; While Darwin believed all of the objections raised by Mivart are answered in the book, he goes on to discuss Mivart&rsquo;s numerous arguments in detail.</p><p>It is clear Darwin is attempting to stave off future critics and solidify his theory of natural selection. However, he argues his critics&rsquo; objections are based on flawed logic. His frustration is apparent in the last paragraph of the chapter when he says the sudden transformationsâ€”in contrast to the slow process of natural selectionâ€”proposed by so many scientists lead to conclusions that &ldquo;enter into the realms of miracle, and [leave] those of science.&rdquo;</p><p>In Darwin&rsquo;s discussion of the giraffe, he attempts to address Mivart&rsquo;s comment he would expect to see other giraffe-like creatures in other regions of the world if having a long neck was advantageous. Darwin&rsquo;s discussion of this topic alludes to the idea of &ldquo;niches&rdquo;â€”different animals filling different ecological roles. While Darwin did not use this term, today it is a common concept based on some of Darwin&rsquo;s initial arguments.</p><hr><a href=#chapter-8--instinct--summary><h1 id=chapter-8--instinct--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 8 : Instinct | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-10><h2 id=summary-10><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p>In this chapterÂ 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/author/ rel=noopener>Darwin</a>Â discusses the idea natural selection informs not only physical characteristics but instincts as well. He fails to define instinct, but compares it to habits, and argues his readers generally know what he is discussing when he uses the term. At the core of his argument is the fact that &ldquo;the instinct of each species is good for itself,&rdquo; but not for another species, thus fulfilling one of the tenets of natural selection. Darwin returns to domesticated animals, this case focusing on dogs. He argues different breeds possess different instinctsâ€”such as herding in sheep dogsâ€”and in all cases, humans would not have selected for these traits if they did not already exist at the outset.</p><p>Darwin describes three cases in which natural selection informs animal/insect instincts: the nest-stealing instinct of cuckoos, the slave-making instinct of ants, and the hive-making instinct of bees. He goes into great detail describing each case and argues that, in all instances, he can see how natural selection could select for these instincts because of the adaptive advantage they provide to each species of interest. After discussing these examples, Darwin addresses the argument against the selection of instincts in the wildâ€”that of sterile male ants. He addresses the processes that might have selected for neutered male ants, arguing the main issue is in the misinterpretation of the speed with which these changes occur. There are only objections if the argument is made these changes occur over very short periods of time. Thus, he concludes this chapter by stating natural selection can be applied not only to &ldquo;corporeal&rdquo; structures but to instincts as well.</p><a href=#analysis-8><h2 id=analysis-8><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p>Having spent approximately half of the book focusing on natural selection pertaining to animals&rsquo; physical traits, in this chapterÂ

He relies on descriptions of specific processes to elucidate the concepts he is discussing and uses bottom-up data (specific examples) to answer top-down processes (natural selection).</p><p>Once again, Darwin anticipates objections to his argument in his discussion of sterile male ants.

<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/author/ rel=noopener>Darwin</a>Â explains when two &ldquo;pure&rdquo; species interbreed, they may produce few offspring, and when these offspringâ€”hybridsâ€”attempt to reproduce, they are unable to do so. Darwin recognizes fertility and sterility represent two ends of a spectrum with innumerable gradations and the scenarios he outlines initially do not represent the sum total of possible variability. For instance, he notes in the fertilization of two distinct speciesâ€”<em>Crinum capense</em>Â withÂ <em>C. revolutum</em>â€”fertile offspring are produced, despite the fact it is not in many other species. Thus, Darwin states the &ldquo;degree of sterility&rdquo; in hybrids cannot be considered &ldquo;absolutely universal.&rdquo;</p><p>Even so, Darwin lays out general rules that govern hybridity. Hybrids created from two species are generally sterile. Equally, hybrids and crosses are affected more by &ldquo;unfavorable conditions.&rdquo; Darwin concludes the laws governing these processes are &ldquo;simply incidental or dependent on unknown differences in their reproductive systems.&rdquo; He is aware there are laws governing these processes but is unable to come to a conclusion regarding their nature.</p><p>Regarding the evolutionary cause of sterility and hybridization, Darwin attempts to place the process within the context of natural selection but is unable to reach a satisfactory conclusion. He moves to a discussion of the physical mechanisms by which reproduction is preventedâ€”such as the inability of the &ldquo;male element&rdquo; to &ldquo;reach the female element.&rdquo; He ultimately admits he can find no adaptive benefit to sterility and hybridization.</p><a href=#analysis-9><h2 id=analysis-9><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/author/ rel=noopener>Darwin</a>&rsquo;s discussion of sterile species crosses and hybrids speaks to the larger long-term processes of natural selection and species formation. He attempts to attribute an adaptive function to the tendency for sterility in these organisms. However, these tendencies are perhaps best understood today as the results of speciation. While not every instance of interspecific breeding results in sterile offspring, in many cases they do. Organisms with minimal genetic differences between them are able to interbreed, but distinct species are often unable to. This is partially attributed to the larger degree of difference resulting from genetic distance due to space or time.</p><p>Prior to the widespread adoption of genetic-based species distinctions, species were largely defined in part by their ability or inability to reproduce together. This concept is referred to as &ldquo;reproductive isolation.&rdquo; Many scientists consider reproductive isolation to be a result of speciation. Reproductive isolation helps preserve distinct species, thereby preventing innumerable gradations and &ldquo;transitional&rdquo; forms. This can occur due to genetic differences, physical barriers, or any number of other physical factors.</p><p>While Darwin was correct in his characterization of species crossings and hybridization, he did not fully characterize why sterility would occur because he failed to understand the genetic basis for these variations. Equally, while he characterized some of the physical incompatibilities that could occur in the reproductive systems of crossed species or hybrids, he was not aware of the mechanism. The mechanism would only be realized when Mendel&rsquo;s genetic work was rediscovered. It is now known when species fail to produce viable offspringâ€”or produce infertile offspringâ€”it is often the case that their chromosomes are incompatible and thus genetically incapable of reproducing.</p><hr><a href=#chapter-10--on-the-imperfection-of-the-geological-record--summary><h1 id=chapter-10--on-the-imperfection-of-the-geological-record--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 10 : On the Imperfection of the Geological Record | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-12><h2 id=summary-12><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p>In this chapterÂ 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/author/ rel=noopener>Darwin</a>Â discusses the geological record in detail, focusing on why there are so few &ldquo;intermediate links&rdquo; between different species. He draws on three points, referring heavily to Lyell and his work,Â <em>Principles of Geology</em>. First, the geological record was formed over a long period of time. Second, the record is imperfect, due to the shifting of the crust and variations in how geological strata are formed. Third, not all animals are able to become fossilsâ€”for instance, soft-bodied animals will only become fossilized in very specialized conditions.</p><p>Darwin notes while he is unsure of the time frame required for a new species to form, he suggests it is longer than the time depth represented in many geological strata. He notes the difficulty for naturalists in distinguishing species from varieties in existing organisms. In contrast, many paleontologists have distinguished species based on small characteristics on a limited number of fossil specimens.</p><p>Darwin addresses one of the potential critics levied at his theory of natural selection based on the fossil record. He notes paleontologists have identified instances where &ldquo;whole groups of species&rdquo; appear. However, he attributes this &ldquo;abrupt&rdquo; appearance to the incompleteness of the geological record. He states the greatest &ldquo;difficulty&rdquo; is in accounting for the age of the earth and notes the degree of variation in species during the Cambrian period (541â€“485.5 million years ago) suggests an age for the earth exceeding the posited age of 20 to 400 million years. Darwin admits he can provide &ldquo;no satisfactory answer&rdquo; to this problem. In conclusion he notes while many geologists and paleontologists originally &ldquo;maintained the immutability of species,&rdquo; they have since revisited this idea. Darwin states the theory of natural selection is a logical extension of the processes described in Lyell&rsquo;s work.</p><a href=#analysis-10><h2 id=analysis-10><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p>The fossil record is inherently biased toward species with hard parts and is inherently spotty. In many cases direct observation of species cannot be made as the fossil may be incomplete or may not represent the varied structure. These facts have led to arguments regarding the lineages of different species and often result in multiple hypotheses. For instance, the discovery ofÂ <em>Homo naledi</em>Â in 2013 led to numerous hypotheses as to where the hominid fit into the line of human evolution.Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/author/ rel=noopener>Darwin</a>Â argues these facts about the fossil record explain why there are so few transitional species represented.</p><p>In this chapter Darwin also discusses the age of the earthâ€”a topic that would not be fully addressed until the 20th century. Darwin correctly hypothesizes that, based on the theory of natural selection, earlier &ldquo;ancestral&rdquo; species existed prior to the Cambrian period. However, inÂ <em>On the Origin of Species</em>, he takes issue with this supposition, as it would greatly extend the age of the earth. While at the time of Darwin&rsquo;s work, the age of the earth was believed to be around 400 million years old, scientists today agree it is approximately 4.7 billion years old. Although he questions his own conclusions, Darwin is correct in assuming ancestral species existed prior to the Cambrian period. Scientists now know there were species in the Precambrian period that were ancestors to those living in the Cambrian period.</p><hr><a href=#chapter-11--on-the-geological-succession-of-organic-beings--summary><h1 id=chapter-11--on-the-geological-succession-of-organic-beings--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 11 : On the Geological Succession of Organic Beings | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-13><h2 id=summary-13><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p>In chapter 11Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/author/ rel=noopener>Darwin</a>Â is mainly concerned with delving further into the &ldquo;imperfection of the geological record.&rdquo; Claims that the geological record is complete and accurate results in the rejection of the theory of natural selection. Darwin begins with a series of observations to prove his theory. First, species formation is slow. Within the same genera, the rate of change of any one species is independent of any other, and variations are ultimately directed by a variety of &ldquo;complex contingencies.&rdquo;</p><p>Darwin then discusses the process of species extinction, claiming catastrophism had been &ldquo;generally given up&rdquo; by contemporary geologists. Instead, the extinction of species is believed to be a process as slowâ€”if not slowerâ€”than the process of species formation. In order to explain the way extinction occurs, he describes &ldquo;unperceived hostile agencies&rdquo;â€”the slow replacement of one species with another form with more beneficial adaptationsâ€”and factors such as competition.</p><p>Darwin then describes how change seems to occur simultaneously throughout the world over long periods of time. He argues this process can be explained by natural selection and the diffusion of species over time across the planet. In this section he also addresses the objection an extinct species can be considered an &ldquo;intermediate between any two living species.&rdquo; He refers to the diagram presented inÂ 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/chapter-4-summary/ rel=noopener>Chapter 4</a>, claiming by extending the time span, it is easy to conceptualize natural selection over long periods of time.</p><p>Later in the chapter, Darwin offers examples of extinct species that were ancestors to modern species present in the same region. Darwin argues for a &ldquo;law of the succession of types&rdquo; to explain the relationship between modern and extinct species in the same region. This pattern can be explained by the theory of natural selection.</p><a href=#analysis-11><h2 id=analysis-11><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/author/ rel=noopener>Darwin</a>Â presents a dual message in this chapter. The geological record may be incomplete, but it is also a record of the ancestral connections between extinct and modern species. Darwin hypothesizes the geological record offers evidence to support the theory of natural selection.</p><p>Darwin claims catastrophism has been rejected by the majority of geologists and the slow time depth associated with extinctions is explained by the theory of natural selection. Many geologists adhered to the theory of catastrophism, but it was gradually replaced by the theory of uniformitarianism, thanks to the work of James Hutton andÂ 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/key-figure-analysis/#Charles_Lyell rel=noopener>Charles Lyell</a>.</p><p>Uniformitarianism is the idea the same processes that formed the earth in the distant past remain in effect today. This implied a longer time span for the formation of geological layers and the extinction of species, both of which provide additional support for the theory of natural selection. However, due to the nature of the geological record and the formation of fossils, the record is inherently incomplete. This fact cannot be discounted when formulating theories of biological processes using the geological record.</p><p>Darwin notes the periods of worldwide change in species composition are only explained by the theory of natural selection. Similar processes can also explain the resemblance between ancient and modern species in one area. Overall, the incorporation of the theory of uniformitarianism is indispensable to strengthening Darwin&rsquo;s argument for the theory of natural selection. He makes this influence explicit, both by citing Lyell and through the relatively large portion of the work he dedicates to elucidating the connection between biological and geological processes.</p><hr><a href=#chapter-12--geographical-distribution--summary><h1 id=chapter-12--geographical-distribution--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 12 : Geographical Distribution | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-14><h2 id=summary-14><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p>Having discussed the geological history of species,Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/author/ rel=noopener>Darwin</a>Â now offers evidence for their geological distributionâ€”a natural extension of his observations regarding the extinct ancestors of many species and genera. He begins with three main points: the distribution of species across the globe cannot be accounted for when considering &ldquo;climatal and other physical conditions&rdquo; alone; the distribution of species is related to the presence of physical barriers; and there is a similarity of species across continents at different points. Darwin argues the similarity of species can be accounted for only through &ldquo;inheritance,&rdquo; while the dissimilarity can also be accounted for through barriers. From these conclusions he suggests it is logical to assume in many cases, species of the same genusâ€”regardless of physical locationâ€”are descended from the same ancestor.</p><p>The remainder of the chapter is devoted to describing a few methods of dispersal: climate, changes in land and sea level, changing continental positions, and glacial periods. Darwin contends that in many cases, plants and animals would have been dispersed during periodic glacial periods due to advancing and receding glaciers. He argues this would have resulted in changing temperatures that would allow for species to spread across continents. Combined with the change in the position of continental plates over time, this would account for the presence of similar species today and fossil specimens in very different geographical regions. Darwin defends the idea of a glacial period, noting evidence for such events has been supported by previous researchers. He comments on a few more observations regarding the biogeographical distribution of species, noting species moving north to south are more likely to adapt to the region than those moving south to north. Overall, the majority of the chapter is dedicated to Darwin&rsquo;s observations regarding biogeographical patterns and potential reasons for their occurrence.</p><a href=#analysis-12><h2 id=analysis-12><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p>Continuing along the same line as the argument presented in the previous chapter,Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/author/ rel=noopener>Darwin</a>Â uses geological and geographical information to bolster his theory of natural selection. He believes an immense time depth is necessary for physical processes to take place due to natural selection. The crux of his argument in this chapter is in many casesâ€”both in modern times as well as in antiquityâ€”similar species from the same genera appear in very different areas of the world. He notes previous arguments have centered on the idea of independent species formation. However, he argues the specificÂ <em>pattern</em>Â of where these similar species occur is indicative of a common ancestor. It is often the case fossil specimens physically similar to modern species are found within the same geographical location.</p><p>Darwin&rsquo;s idea species originated from a common ancestor was made possible because of the changing views of geological time and processes in the 19th century. His ideas were built upon those stated by his predecessors and contemporaries. However, his insights were also based on numerous observations of similar species in different regions and continents, ancestral fossil species, experiments involving the possibility of seeds being transported over the ocean, and observations of the relative hardiness of seeds in bird scat among others. In sum, while Darwin did not conceive of the idea of a common ancestor in a vacuum, he was able to accurately describe it based on his own observations.</p><hr><a href=#chapter-13--geographical-distribution_continued_-summary><h1 id=chapter-13--geographical-distribution_continued_-summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 13 : Geographical Distributionâ€”<em>continued</em>Â | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-15><h2 id=summary-15><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p>In this chapterÂ 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/author/ rel=noopener>Darwin</a>Â discusses the distribution of classes, genera, and species in regards to freshwater systems and islands. He notes freshwater systems in disparate countries will sometimes contain very similar freshwater species despite oceanic barriers one might think would be impassible. He goes on to describe how this might have occurred, positing &ldquo;accidental means&rdquo; such as floods or whirlwinds, as well as the distribution of some species by othersâ€”such as the transportation of shells by ducks and the movement of plants through the digestive system of other species.</p><p>Regarding oceanic islands, Darwin is struck by the distribution of species on islands. There are fewer species inhabiting oceanic islands compared to the mainland. Islands will often have frogs, toads, newts, and other amphibious creatures not found on the mainland. In contrast, terrestrial or aerial mammals are found on almost every island. There is a correlation between the species present on an island and the mainland, and the relative degree of proximity between the two. This relationship also holds true for island archipelagos. Species do not spread rapidly from one island to another.</p><p>In all cases Darwin emphasizes these patterns cannot be explained by creationism, but by the theory of natural selection along with the acceptance of uniformitarianism and the antiquity of the earth. Paraphrasing naturalist Edward Forbes, Darwin notes, &ldquo;There is a striking parallelism in the laws of life throughout time and space.&rdquo; He argues these laws explain the variation and similarities seen in freshwater systems and oceanic islands. The end of the chapter concludes Darwin&rsquo;s thoughts on geographical distribution, but his concluding paragraphs emphasize the overall importance of understanding how natural selection plays out over time and space.</p><a href=#analysis-13><h2 id=analysis-13><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p>The continuation of the discussion of geographical distributions makes clear this is a subjectÂ 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/author/ rel=noopener>Darwin</a>Â has greatly considered. There is a profound correlation between geological processes and natural selection. This chapter, together withÂ 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/chapter-12-summary/ rel=noopener>Chapter 12</a>, is one of the first biogeographical studies of animals and plants across the world. While this is a very important aspect of biological and ecological work todayâ€”one that informs conservation practicesâ€”it was a relatively new idea at the time of publication.</p><p>The observations Darwin makes regarding freshwater systems and oceanic islands are based mainly on reflections he made during his voyage aboard the HMSÂ <em>Beagle</em>. In all cases, while he is talking about the variation in classes, genera, and species he observed in locations such as New Zealand and the GalÃ¡pagos Islands, Darwin frames these observations in geological time. It is obvious the power of the theory of natural selection in explaining some of these processes lies with Darwin&rsquo;s understanding of the time depth involved in these processes. This is clearly shown in the appearance of species in new environments having traveled from the mainland to a nearbyâ€”or relatively nearbyâ€”island.</p><p>Lyell&rsquo;s influence is especially apparent in this chapter. Using the principle of uniformitarianism, Darwin is able to explain why island species may be so similar, and yet different, from nearby mainland species. He states: &ldquo;In looking to the long succession of past ages &mldr; we find that species in certain classes differ little from each other.&rdquo; These geological processes, in conjunction with natural propertiesâ€”such as the relative ability of certain classes of animals to move to different locationsâ€”help explain observations Darwin makes, such as the dearth of frogs, toads, and newts in contrast to the presence of mammals on island locations.</p><hr><a href=#chapter-14--mutual-affinities-of-organic-beings--summary><h1 id=chapter-14--mutual-affinities-of-organic-beings--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 14 : Mutual Affinities of Organic Beings | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-16><h2 id=summary-16><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/author/ rel=noopener>Darwin</a>Â dedicates this chapter to describing the current classification system for organisms, along with its inherent issues. He starts by defining &ldquo;natural systems&rdquo; but notes there is no clear definition for what a &ldquo;natural system&rdquo; is. In many cases what is meant by the term is the &ldquo;plan of the Creator.&rdquo; He argues by organizing organisms by this &ldquo;plan,&rdquo; nothing is &ldquo;added to our knowledge.&rdquo; In other words organizing organisms this way serves no purpose in understanding the natural world. Instead, Darwin proposes classifying organisms based on ancestral descent. He sees this as the most obvious form of classification when considered as part of the theory of natural selection.</p><p>Darwin goes on to describe problems inherent with the current classification system, specifically with determining important versus non-important characteristics for classification. He relates this to variations in adult characteristics, as well as characteristics in the embryotic stage. Darwin argues the current classification system seems &ldquo;arbitrary.&rdquo; He suggests the system should instead be genealogical in terms of the arrangement of larger groups and the degree of difference used to determine different genera and species. However, he notes analogous features can cause issues in determining actual genealogical relationships in contrast with homologous features that can help show ancestral descent. He also notes organs on an organism that bear the &ldquo;stamp of inutility&rdquo; can also be used to show previous ancestral connections between species or genera.</p><p>Darwin explicitly notes the work of Ernst Haeckel in developing phylogenies, proclaiming it as the future of classification systems. Darwin believes this system of classification should be adopted at the exclusion of all others. He ends the chapter with the following statement: &ldquo;Species, genera and families &mldr; are all descended, each within its own class or group, from common parents.&rdquo;</p><a href=#analysis-14><h2 id=analysis-14><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p>Up to this point, the method of organism classification within science had been fairly arbitrary. It had been over a century since Carl Linnaeus had first publishedÂ <em>Systema Naturae</em>Â in 1735. Yet, while the method for naming species and genera had been in use, the method for classifying these organisms had yet to be developed.Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/author/ rel=noopener>Darwin</a>&rsquo;s main argument in this chapter is the current system of classificationâ€”based on distinguishing between organisms that have been intelligently created versus those that had notâ€”does not provide a useful system of classification. In other words it does not reveal anything about the natural world. Darwin&rsquo;s proposed classification systemâ€”based on the phylogenies of Ernst Haeckelâ€”is grounded in the theory of natural selection. He argues it would be a more useful system of classification because it would explain the history of descent. This phylogenetic system is still in use today.</p><p>However, Darwin suggested this system of classification should be based on physical similarities of adults and embryotic stages. In contrast, most of the phylogenetic work today is based on genetic groupings of monophyletic organismsâ€”organisms descended from a common ancestor. This work began in the second half of the 20th century and has since replaced phylogenies based on physical characteristics alone. However, Darwin&rsquo;s recommendation for the grouping of organisms based on these traits represents the first forays into phylogenetic groupings of organisms that inform much of biological and ecological work today.</p><p>Darwin&rsquo;s final statementâ€”all organisms are descended from a common ancestorâ€”is the logical extension of the theory of natural selection and reveals the continued insight and relevance of Darwin&rsquo;s thought process and work. Today, the modern definition of species is dependent on the idea of common ancestry.</p><hr><a href=#chapter-15--recapitulation-and-conclusion--summary><h1 id=chapter-15--recapitulation-and-conclusion--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 15 : Recapitulation and Conclusion | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-17><h2 id=summary-17><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p>In the final chapterÂ 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/author/ rel=noopener>Darwin</a>Â notes the book has been &ldquo;one long argument,&rdquo; and his goal is to summarize the arguments in an attempt to convince the reader of the full strength of his case. He also readdresses some of the arguments that have been posited against the theory of natural selection, noting that in all cases, &ldquo;They are by no means sufficient to overthrow&rdquo; the theory of natural selection.</p><p>It is also in this chapter Darwin defines explicitly for the first time the difference between creatures &ldquo;produced by special acts of creation&rdquo; and varieties &ldquo;produced by secondary laws.&rdquo; This puts his earlier argumentâ€”there is no distinction between species and varietiesâ€”into perspective. Darwin claims the current method of defining what constitutes a &ldquo;species&rdquo; versus a &ldquo;variety&rdquo; is flawed. He goes on to say basing the distinction on created versus non-created organisms is inherently ineffectual if natural selection is considered the main form of variation seen in the natural world.</p><p>Darwin ends the chapter by reiterating he does not find natural selection to be the only means by which variations in organisms occur. However, he claims it is theÂ <em>main</em>Â form by which variation occurs. He notes the main reason people may fail to consider the theory of natural selection is because they are &ldquo;slow in admitting great changes&rdquo; when the process is not immediately apparent. However, he argues the natural world becomes inherently much more interesting when change is believed to occur due to natural selection, as opposed to acts of creation. In Darwin&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;There is grandeur in this view of life.&rdquo;</p><a href=#analysis-15><h2 id=analysis-15><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/On-the-Origin-of-Species/author/ rel=noopener>Darwin</a>Â uses this chapter to reiterate the arguments he has made over the course of the book. He also explicitly addresses some of the implications of the theory of natural selection and is mainly concerned with readdressing some of his main points, explicitly noting arguments that have been attacked by previous critics. Darwin&rsquo;s goal is to leave the reader with a strong argument that leaves little room for disagreement. However, he agrees in some cases the arguments posited against his work are not born from a deep-seated issue, but rather arise from misunderstandings, or a gut reaction against the idea. Those objections he cannot argue against.</p><p>Darwin clearly states some of the implications against the creation of organisms implied by his theory. He does so by arguing for a more rigorous method of distinguishing species, rather than relying on the arbitrary distinction between organisms that have been intelligently designed and those created by other laws. Darwin uses the last couple of paragraphs to suggest the natural world becomes richer and more interesting when considered through the lens of the theory of natural selection in contrast to that of creationism.</p><p>Previous chapters hint at some of the implications Darwin explicitly states in this last chapter, and he draws on some of these arguments to make his case. It is clear he is aware the implication against creationism is what many individuals will critique. He is attempting to implore individuals to consider natural selection by appealing to their sense of scientific interest. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it is still these same perceived issues that are put forth today against the theory of natural selection. The dispute between those who believe solely in creationism and those who believe in the theory of natural selection is an argument that began even before Darwin&rsquo;s time and continues today.</p><hr><a href=#timeline-of-influence-and-controversy><h1 id=timeline-of-influence-and-controversy><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Timeline of Influence and Controversy</h1></a><a href=#174996-pre-darwinian-conceptions-of-species-change><h2 id=174996-pre-darwinian-conceptions-of-species-change><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>1749â€“96: Pre-Darwinian Conceptions of Species Change</h2></a><p>Georges Buffon publishesÂ <em>Histoire Naturelle</em>Â in 1749, one of the first works to suggest changes in organisms can result in the formation of new species.

Initially uninterested in obtaining a formal education, Darwin was nonetheless heavily influenced by his time spent studying medicine at Edinburgh University in 1825. This education provided him with the basic skills needed to conduct naturalist research aboard the HMSÂ <em>Beagle</em>, a British ship that sailed around the world on a journey lasting five years (1831â€“36). Such skills included specimen preparation and an understanding of geological processes and chemistry. Darwin&rsquo;s time at the university also exposed him to the ideas of leading geologists, zoologists, and other researchers. These ideasâ€”such as Scottish geologist Charles Lyell&rsquo;s theory of uniformitarianismâ€”structured Darwin&rsquo;s perception of the natural world and ultimately informed his theory of natural selection.</p><p>In 1828 Darwin began attending Christ&rsquo;s College in Cambridge and earned a Bachelor of Arts in 1831. It was here Darwin would be inspired to travelâ€”first by Professor Adam Sedgwick, who took Darwin on his first geological field experience in Wales, and later by Professor John Stevens Henslow. Henslow encouraged Darwin to apply for the position of geologist and naturalist aboard the HMSÂ <em>Beagle</em>.</p><a href=#hms_beagle_and-the-aftermath><h3 id=hms_beagle_and-the-aftermath><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>HMSÂ <em>Beagle</em>Â and the Aftermath</h3></a><p>The HMSÂ <em>Beagle</em>Â left England in 1831. At the time Darwin was age 22, and the journey would take five years to complete. He would sail from England to the tip of South America, stopping off at numerous ports along the way. During this voyage Darwin read Charles Lyell&rsquo;sÂ <em>Principles of Geology</em>Â (1830â€“33), a book that inspired him to record the geology of the locations he visited and provided the framework for his later arguments. Over the course of this journey, Darwin made observations that supported his ideas of the evolution of species and influenced his theory of natural selection.</p><p>When he returned to England, Darwin established himself as a geologist and naturalist. He published his ideas in two works:Â <em>Journal of Researches into the Geology and Natural History of the Various Countries Visited by HMS Beagle</em>Â in 1839 andÂ <em>Zoology of the Voyage of HMS Beagle</em>Â from 1838â€“43. During this period, Darwin began to formulate his theory of natural selection, but it would take him years to fully construct his argument.</p><p>In 1842 Darwin moved to the village of Downe, outside of London, and continued to publish largely on topics of geological interest while tending to the reported intestinal and heart afflictions that ailed him. Later researchers have argued over the nature of Darwin&rsquo;s health problemsâ€”they are generally believed to have been a result of physical and psychosomatic factors. Despite Darwin&rsquo;s geological focus at this time, he continued to show interest in zoology and from 1846â€“54 published four papers on barnacles.</p><a href=#formulating_on-the-origin-of-species_><h3 id=formulating_on-the-origin-of-species_><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>FormulatingÂ <em>On the Origin of Species</em></h3></a><p>In 1856 Darwin began to write a book calledÂ <em>Natural Selection</em>. On June 18, 1858, he received a letter from British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace asking for advice on a manuscript he was working on. The manuscript featured ideas very similar to those Darwin was proposing inÂ <em>Natural Selection</em>. Wallace&rsquo;s ideas provided Darwin the incentive to publish his own ideas, which, up to this point, he had been reluctant to do because of the controversy he believed these ideas would generate. However, the fear Wallace would publish before him proved a great motivator.</p><p>The first presentation of the theory of natural selection took place at the Linnean Society in 1858. It was to be a joint presentation by both Darwin and Wallace, but Darwin was not able to attend due to the death of one of his children. A year later Darwin published the revised version of his manuscript, now titledÂ <em>On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or The Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life</em>. The reaction to the book&rsquo;s publication was mixed. While a group of scientists agreed with Darwin&rsquo;s theory of natural selection, much of the scientific community maintained their belief in creationism. Darwin attempted to avoid the controversy surroundingÂ <em>On the Origin of Species</em>Â and attempted to stay out of the public&rsquo;s eye, while friends and colleaguesâ€”such as Thomas Huxleyâ€”defended the idea of human evolution publically.</p><p>Darwin&rsquo;s health was in continual decline, but he ultimately produced six editions ofÂ <em>On the Origin of Species</em>. In 1871 he directly addressed the evolution of humankind in his book,Â <em>The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex</em>. Darwin continued to expound on the subject of natural selection until his death on April 19, 1882. In 1890 the Royal Society created the Darwin Medal in recognition of distinguished works in the biological sciences. The Darwin Medal&rsquo;s first recipient was Darwin&rsquo;s colleague, Alfred Russel Wallace.</p><p>The rejection of the idea of creationism detailed inÂ <em>On the Origin of Species</em>Â is a controversy that has persisted. Many believe Darwin&rsquo;s ideas are in direct opposition to religious belief. Despite the continued controversy within the public sphere, the book has remained highly influential within the scientific community and continues to be recognized for its notable scientific contributions.</p><hr><a href=#10-things-you-didnt-know><h1 id=10-things-you-didnt-know><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>10 Things You Didn&rsquo;t Know</h1></a><p><em>On the Origin of Species</em>Â is one of the most scientifically noteworthy, impactful, and viciously condemned biological texts ever written. Charles Darwin publishedÂ <em>On the Origin of Species</em>Â in 1859 to explain his theory of natural selectionâ€”the notion that species evolve based on traits and characteristics of individuals that allow them to thrive more easily in their environments, while individuals without these subtle traits die out. Composed after extensive studies around the world, Darwin&rsquo;s text was met with harsh criticism from the established Christian tradition that claimed species had always existed &ldquo;as they were,&rdquo; and therefore did not change over time.</p><p>Although Darwin did not intend to undermine religious authority, his findings clashed with Christian dogmaâ€•a conflict that would lead to more than a century of debate. However,Â <em>On the Origin of Species</em>Â proved to be the defining text of modern evolutionary biology, and it acted as a catalyst for understanding the living world in an entirely new way. Scientists have since used Darwin&rsquo;s work as a springboard to further their own research, and the theory of evolution he established has become the primary scientific lens through which people understand the development of life on the planet.</p><a href=#1_on-the-origin-of-species_was-inspired-by-darwins-incredible-voyage-around-the-world><h2 id=1_on-the-origin-of-species_was-inspired-by-darwins-incredible-voyage-around-the-world><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>1.Â <em>On the Origin of Species</em>Â was inspired by Darwin&rsquo;s incredible voyage around the world.</h2></a><p>Darwin had the opportunity to accompany the British survey ship,Â 
<a href=http://www.nationalgeographic.com.au/history/darwins-voyages.aspx rel=noopener>HMSÂ <em>Beagle</em></a>, on an exploratory voyage around the world. Although Darwin&rsquo;s most notable biological findings came from the Galapagos Islands, the voyage took him to many distant lands including South America, the South Pacific, South Africa, and Australia. During his time aboard, he had the privileged status of &ldquo;gentleman naturalist,&rdquo; and he was allowed to collect samples and specimens in each location at will. His main setback throughout the voyage, wasÂ 
<a href=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charles-Darwin/The-Beagle-voyage rel=noopener>persistent seasickness</a>. Darwin took extensive notes that would inspire him to writeÂ <em>On the Origin of Species</em>, and he collected over 1,500 different plant and animal specimens to bring home.</p><a href=#2-darwin-was-almost-denied-a-spot-on-the_beagle_voyage-due-to-the-shape-of-his-nose><h2 id=2-darwin-was-almost-denied-a-spot-on-the_beagle_voyage-due-to-the-shape-of-his-nose><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>2.

The ship&rsquo;s captain, Captain Fitzroy, was an ardent follower of the Swiss poet and scientist Johann Kaspar Lavater, who posited that an individual&rsquo;s character could be determined by physiological traits such as their facial structure or the shape of their nose. Fitzroy was convinced that, due to his nose shape, Darwin would be a poor addition to the voyage. Darwin&rsquo;s uncle protested the captain&rsquo;s decision, and he was eventually allowed to come along. Speaking of the voyage,Â 
<a href=https://www.wired.com/2015/01/fantastically-wrong-physiognomy/ rel=noopener>Darwin recalled</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Â [Fitzroy] was convinced that he could judge a man&rsquo;s character by the outline of his features; and he doubted wheather [sic] anyone with my nose could possess sufficient energy and determination for the voyage.Â </p></blockquote><a href=#3-darwins-father-wanted-him-to-become-a-doctorbut-darwin-hated-the-sight-of-blood><h2 id=3-darwins-father-wanted-him-to-become-a-doctorbut-darwin-hated-the-sight-of-blood><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>3. Darwin&rsquo;s father wanted him to become a doctorâ€”but Darwin hated the sight of blood.</h2></a><p>Before his interests in the natural sciences, Darwin was training for the priesthood. But earlier still, Darwin&rsquo;s father persistently pressured him toÂ 
<a href=https://www.biography.com/people/charles-darwin-9266433 rel=noopener>pursue medical practice</a>. Darwin&rsquo;s father was a medical doctor, and he wanted the same career for his son. Unfortunately, Darwin was made extremely uneasy by the sight of blood, so his father quickly realized this wasn&rsquo;t a realistic option. DarwinÂ 
<a href=http://necsi.edu/projects/evolution/darwin/early/darwin_early.html rel=noopener>attended medical school</a>Â from 1825â€“27, and he was forced to observe primitive surgical operations that, due to the medical limitations at the time, were conducted without the use of anesthetics or painkillers.</p><a href=#4-darwin-was-inspired-by-his-grandfather-who-used-poetry-to-write-about-evolution><h2 id=4-darwin-was-inspired-by-his-grandfather-who-used-poetry-to-write-about-evolution><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>4. Darwin was inspired by his grandfather, who used poetry to write about evolution.</h2></a><p>Although Darwin is often credited as the father of evolutionary theory, other scientists had proposed similar hypotheses beforehand. One such figure was Darwin&rsquo;s own grandfather, the accomplished botanistÂ 
<a href=https://www.thoughtco.com/people-who-influenced-charles-darwin-1224651 rel=noopener>Erasmus Darwin</a>. Erasmus believed that species did, in fact, change over time, but he never published these theories in scientific form. Instead, he used poetry to hint at the possibility of evolutionary change in animals and plantsâ€”a clever method that prevented him from coming under attack by Church officials. Darwin was very familiar with his grandfather&rsquo;s work, and he saw it as an inspiration for his own theories.Â 
<a href=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/sep/21/featuresreviews.guardianreview30 rel=noopener>Darwin&rsquo;s poem</a>Â &ldquo;Economy of Vegetation&rdquo; combined references to biblical creation with a more scientifically based allusion to the &ldquo;Big Bang&rdquo; theory, reading:</p><blockquote><p>Â &ldquo;Let There Be Light!&rdquo; Astonish&rsquo;d Chaos heard the potent word.

Contemporary critics have noted Darwin&rsquo;s persistent racism.</h2></a><p>Despite Darwin&rsquo;s impact on the natural sciences, contemporary readers often find his writings to be incredibly racially insensitive. While traveling with the HMSÂ <em>Beagle</em>, Darwin encountered many cultures and peoples that the British, at the time, considered uncivilized and backward. In his writings,Â 
<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=B8ml_upmCWEC&lpg=PA229&dq=darwin-%22miserable%2C-degraded-savages%22&pg=PA229#v=onepage&q&f=false" rel=noopener>he describes</a>Â the peoples of Tierra del Fuego in South America as &ldquo;miserable, degraded savages.&rdquo;</p><p>Although Darwin believed all human beings were of the same species, he divided them intoÂ 
<a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2672903/ rel=noopener>distinct racial subsets</a>, attributing different traits to each. This underscored his belief that whites were more &ldquo;evolutionarily advanced&rdquo; than other racesâ€”a troubling aspect of his theory that was used to justify racism and racially oppressive policies in later decades.</p><a href=#6-darwin-delayed-publication-of_on-the-origin-of-species_for-20-yearsa-time-known-as-the-long-wait><h2 id=6-darwin-delayed-publication-of_on-the-origin-of-species_for-20-yearsa-time-known-as-the-long-wait><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>6.

<a href=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/%C2%93darwins-delay%C2%94-the-stuff-of-myth rel=noopener>the long wait</a>.&rdquo; Many scholars believe that Darwin delayed publication due to fear of the inevitable backlash from both the scientific community and the Church. However, contemporary researchers have disputed this, claiming instead that the delay was a result of Darwin&rsquo;s declining health, as well as the fact that he was working on numerous other projects at the same time.</p><a href=#7-darwins-publishers-wanted_on-the-origin-of-species_to-focus-primarily-on-pigeons><h2 id=7-darwins-publishers-wanted_on-the-origin-of-species_to-focus-primarily-on-pigeons><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>7. Darwin&rsquo;s publishers wantedÂ <em>On the Origin of Species</em>Â to focus primarily on pigeons.</h2></a><p>When Darwin was working to finalizeÂ <em>On the Origin of Species</em>, his publisher, John Murray, received a strange suggestion:Â 
<a href=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/letter/DCP-LETT-2457A.xml rel=noopener>focus on pigeons</a>. The critic and editor Whitwell Elwin wrote to Murray to discuss Darwin&rsquo;s work, and he was convinced that the text would be best-received if it used pigeons as the primary focal point to discuss evolutionary biology. Elwin claimed:</p><blockquote><p>Â Every body is interested in pigeons. The book would be reviewed in every journal in the kingdom, & would soon be on every table. The public at large can better understand a question when it is narrowed to a single case of this kind than when the whole varied kingdom of nature is brought under discussion at the outset.Â </p></blockquote><p>While Elwin&rsquo;s claim that the public can more easily understand a narrower study focused on one particular subject makes sense, it&rsquo;s unclear why he thought pigeons were the best option.</p><a href=#8-there-are-over-250-species-named-after-darwinas-well-as-a-city-in-australia><h2 id=8-there-are-over-250-species-named-after-darwinas-well-as-a-city-in-australia><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>8.

The cityâ€”capital of Australia&rsquo;s Northern Territory with a population of more than 100,000 peopleâ€”was renamed for the naturalist in 1911.
