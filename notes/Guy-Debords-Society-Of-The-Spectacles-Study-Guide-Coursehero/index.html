Situationism theorizes that human beings&rsquo; behavior is determined by their surroundings and current circumstances rather than by their personal qualities. Situationism was born out of the ideas and ideologies of Karl Marx (1818â€“83) who believed strongly in the concept of state-owned property. State-owned property means that resources are distributed based on a person&rsquo;s contributions to society. Guy Debord sums up his basic theory of situationism and the spectacle by stating, &ldquo;In societies where modern conditions of production prevail, all of life presents itself as an immense accumulation of spectacles.&rdquo; Debord theorizes that spectacles are images which people see that make a product or service seem grand and shift the focus away from what the product or service actually is.</p><a href=#perspective-and-narrator><h3 id=perspective-and-narrator><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Perspective and Narrator</h3></a><p>Guy Debord uses a third-person omniscient point of view to describe and explain his theories about the spectacle of modern society. This point of view is also known as the authorial-journalist point of view.</p><a href=#about-the-title><h3 id=about-the-title><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>About the Title</h3></a><p><em>Society of the Spectacle</em>Â acquires its title from the core concept of situationism which focuses on society&rsquo;s fascination with everyday spectacles. According to Guy Debord, spectacles are grand displays that are placed on consumer products and social interactions that are brought about by images.</p><a href=#guy-debord-biography><h1 id=guy-debord-biography><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Guy Debord |Â Biography</h1></a><p>Guy Debord was born in Paris, France, on December 28, 1931. He was a novelist, filmmaker, political activist, and Marxist philosopher. His thoughts about images and the society of the spectacle influenced the social revolution of 1968 and are a major reason why many sociologists consider Debord a prominent 20th-century ideologue.</p><a href=#the-beginnings-of-spectacle-theory><h4 id=the-beginnings-of-spectacle-theory><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Beginnings of Spectacle Theory</h4></a><p>When Debord was 20 years old, he met a Romanian thinker named Isidore Isou (1925â€“2007). Isou was a central figure in an artistic and cultural movement known as lettrism. Lettrism is the concept of using letters as imagery instead of focusing on the natural linguistic meaning that the letter actually has. In 1952 Debord criticized silent-film star Charlie Chaplin (1889â€“1977) whose impostures were popular with moviegoers. Debord directly confronted Chaplin who was seen as a leading figure in the world of the spectacle. Chaplin&rsquo;s entire career was built on generalizing feelings from images. Debord strongly felt that Chaplin was a &ldquo;phony of the senses.&rdquo; Debord&rsquo;s criticism of Chaplin became the foundation for the thesis that Debord published 15 years later in his essayÂ <em>Society of the Spectacle</em>Â (1967).</p><a href=#prominent-contributions><h4 id=prominent-contributions><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Prominent Contributions</h4></a><p>Debord used his feelings regarding Chaplin to criticize the conversion of cinema into a cluster of images that reconstruct the viewer as a consumer who believes that anything goes and anything is possible. Debord&rsquo;s theory asserts that images shown on the cinema screen are controlled by the system. The capitalists who show spectacular images want to subconsciously steer the viewer in the direction that companies desire.Â <em>Society of the Spectacle</em>Â is based on the concepts that began with Debord&rsquo;s feelings on Chaplin and moved into the world of capitalism and consumerism.</p><p>In 1968 just one year after the publication ofÂ <em>Society of the Spectacle</em>, there was a revolt in France that had direct ties to Debord&rsquo;s beliefs. The event which is now termed May 68 began with students protesting extreme capitalism and American influence on French culture. The protests ground France&rsquo;s economy to a halt and prompted fears of complete civil revolution.</p><p>Debord was not shy with his criticism of cinema and decided to make his own film in response. In 1952 Debord directed his first filmÂ <em>Hurlements en faveur de Sade</em>Â (1952). The film included the voices of MichÃ¨le Bernstein (b.1932) who was a prominent figure in the lettrist movement and artist Gil Wolman (1929â€“95). The film contains no images or pictures of any kind. The only thing seen on the screen is bright white during spoken dialogue and black when there is no speaking. The film is full of long periods of silence that separate the speech. The film concludes with 24 minutes of complete silence and a black screen. The film generated some anger among theatergoers who felt cheated by the lack of imagery.</p><a href=#death-and-remembrance><h4 id=death-and-remembrance><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Death and Remembrance</h4></a><p>Debord settled in Seville, Spain, in the latter days of his life and became obese and unhealthy. On the last day of November 1994, Debord ended his life by firing a shot to his heart. In 2009 the French government classified Debord&rsquo;s work as a national treasure considered to be of great importance to the history and culture of France.</p><hr><a href=#main-ideas><h1 id=main-ideas><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Main Ideas</h1></a><a href=#the-culture-of-the-spectacle><h2 id=the-culture-of-the-spectacle><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Culture of the Spectacle</h2></a><p>Guy Debord goes into great detail to explain the spectacle. Debord believes a society that is driven by spectacle is fostered by relationships and that those relationships are brought about through imagery. Debord asserts that because the culture of spectacle centers on images, the brand names behind everyday products are important to people. Commodification focuses on the image rather than the actual product the image is portraying. The perceived benefit of the product is based on an abstract idea instead of the true attributes and uses of the commodity or product. An example of spectacle commercialism is found in the advertising of soft drinks. Companies will often portray people who drink the specific soda in the commercials as full of energy, having an appealing physical stature, and being involved in exciting social activities. The spectacle on the screen gives the soft drink abstract attributes that the real product does not actually contain. The spectacle also creates a sense of belonging by creating a perception that a person is not part of the current culture unless they own or use a particular soft drink. Companies use spectacular images to create a belief that everyone else in a person&rsquo;s circle of society has the product. This perception motivates a person to purchase the product not because they truly need it but because they feel left out if they do not.</p><p>In modern society the spectacle has become a part of the fabric of culture as capitalism turns perception and experience into a raw material good that can be bought and sold. Debord analyzes how the spectacle society is able to use imagery to create the idea that something has certain value attached to it that it might not otherwise have. Commercials show happy families going to an amusement park or playing a board game. The imagery creates the assumption that if the person watching the advertisement buys the game or takes their family to the park, they will also be happy. The reality is that a board game and a theme park do not actually contain happiness. The spectacle of the associated images places those attributes on them.</p><a href=#cultural-authenticity><h2 id=cultural-authenticity><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Cultural Authenticity</h2></a><p>Cultural authenticity is the extent to which an image or spectacle reflects the worldview of beliefs and values and depicts accurate details of everyday life and language for a specific cultural group. Debord underscores that as a result of cultural homogenization through commodities, true and authentic culture is devalued. He explains that cultural homogenization through capitalism occurs when different cultures throughout the world become more similar to one another because the products they consume are the same. The most glaring example of the homogenization of culture can be found in the food people consume. At one time foods from different cultures were unique to those cultures and geographic locations. Jamaican food was consumed in Jamaica, and another culture that wanted to experience Jamaican food would have to travel to Jamaica and experience the entire culture. Through commodification of food however, a person can enter a mall food court in North America, Europe, or Asia and experience foods from many different cultures in the same place. A person can walk the streets of New York, Paris, London, or Shanghai and see the same clothing brands and electronics and hear the same music. Companies either reappropriate or copy old tested ideas for consumers rather than come up with new and untested products. Cultural authenticity is lost because consumer culture becomes about representation and appearance. A person who owns a Prada bag is seen as living a certain kind of life. The expectation is that when that bag is purchased the consumer will instantly feel different and be part of a different social circle.</p><p>Debord strongly believes that this idea is a twisted version of the truth that is packaged in an appealing manner for consumers to become fixated on. Companies incorporate celebrities and social status into their commercials which ingrain the images and ideas in social life. The fact that the images become ingrained across many different societies leads to a severe decline in cultural authenticity.</p><a href=#society-of-having><h2 id=society-of-having><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Society of Having</h2></a><p>Debord suggests that the capitalistic direction that society is taking and the effect it has on consumers is degrading life. He proposes that the society of the spectacle is trending away from a society of living for life and being replaced by a society of having. The spectacle further degrades the society from actually having to the appearance of having. He submits that a person&rsquo;s reality is displaced in favor of appearances. The concept of the appearance of having is best demonstrated by the growing market of counterfeit and fake brand name goods. A person purchases a fake item with the brand logo of an expensive product. They pay a significantly reduced price for the cheaper, counterfeit version, but the logo gives other people the belief that the person who owns the product must have money and live a certain lifestyle. This concept extends even to social life which Debord argues has become more of a representation of social life. In modern life social media allows people to share and display only the positive aspects of their lives. It even allows them to &ldquo;fake&rdquo; aspects of their social lives to build the appearance of having a robust lifestyle. Debord argues that this replacement is aided by capitalism and mass media that spread and cultivate the spectacle. Debord explains that in the advanced stages of spectacle, relationships among products replace relationships among people. Corporations see people as objects that can produce or appear to produce commodities and then stand in awe of the spectacle created for them.</p><hr><a href=#context><h1 id=context><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Context</h1></a><a href=#marxism><h2 id=marxism><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Marxism</h2></a><p>WhenÂ 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/key-figure-analysis/#Guy_Debord rel=noopener>Guy Debord</a>Â wroteÂ <em>Society of the Spectacle</em>, the political philosophy of communism was on the decline worldwide and a strong push for capitalism was well underway. Debord wrote and published the essay in response to the decline of Marxism. Debord&rsquo;s assertion that modern society was basing itself on consumerism led to his concept of situationism. Situationism is born out of Marxism but puts a different twist on Karl Marx&rsquo;s strong beliefs. Marxism was thought up by Karl Marx (1818â€“83) and to a lesser degree Friedrich Engels (1820â€“95). The two men were German philosophers and revolutionaries who met and discovered that they shared similar theories about philosophy and socialism. Their beliefs attacked their perceived problems with the capitalist style of society and offered a type of socialism as a solution. The philosophy is known as Marxism and is derived from Karl Marx&rsquo;s surname.</p><p>Marxism is very different from capitalism and can be contrasted by understanding the concept of the means of production. Capitalist economies are based on the means of production being owned by corporations and wealthy individuals. The corporations and wealthy individuals who are known as capitalists hire people to join the workforce. The workforce then produces goods and services and is compensated in the form of monetary wages. The people in the workforce do not own the equipment or the inventory of the goods they produce. They generally have no control over the final product or how the product is made. The workers only have their service, skills, and knowledge to offer which leads to their exploitation according to Marx.</p><p>In a true Marxist society, the means of production should be owned by the public in general. Marx believed that the primary motive should be the people&rsquo;s well-being and not constant striving for the accumulation of profit and wealth. Marx suggests that in a capitalist society people are divided into two major segments. Marx calls those segments the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. The proletariat is made up of people who sell their labor power to live and do not have any means of production. The bourgeoisie is made up of the people who own the means of production. The bourgeoisie buys services from the proletariat for production and compensates them through wages. Marx believed that the relationship between the two would result in a proletariat revolution whereby the proletariat would rebel and seek to even the playing field between the two segments. The ultimate goal of the revolution would be to redistribute the means of production between both groups.</p><a href=#consumerism><h2 id=consumerism><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Consumerism</h2></a><p>Consumerism is an economic and social belief that centers on encouraging consumption or accumulation of goods by consumers. Consumerism encourages purchasing and consuming of goods that go well beyond a person&rsquo;s basic needs. At the core of consumerism is the idea that an individual&rsquo;s personal happiness and well-being are defined by the acquisition and accumulation of wealth and material goods. In simple terms a person&rsquo;s general success is defined by how much they have and how much they use.</p><p>The economic side of consumerism is based on policies that encourage consumption of goods and services in an excessive way. In a consumerist society, people are constantly assaulted by advertisements, sales, and product giveaways intended to encourage people to buy more. Consumerism motivates the pursuit for the &ldquo;good life&rdquo; even though it may come at the expense of saving, investing, and preparing for events and life in the future.</p><p>Consumerism plays a central role inÂ 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/author/ rel=noopener>Guy Debord</a>&rsquo;s theory of the spectacle. Debord suggests that companies use consumerism to create everyday spectacles that try to influence consumers to buy more goods. The spectacles are designed to create a sense of awe for products and services that motivate people to go out and buy those products. The spectacles are created in a way that gives the consumer the feeling of missing out if they do not participate.</p><a href=#television-and-media><h2 id=television-and-media><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Television and Media</h2></a><p>When Guy Debord wroteÂ <em>The Society of the Spectacle</em>Â in 1967, technology was progressing at a rapid pace. Televisions graced the living rooms of most families, and computers were gaining momentum rapidly. Television today allows companies to advertise heavily to the public, and millions of dollars are spent to hire professionals who are experts in human behavior and psychology. Advertisers create commercials that have a much more spectacular impact on the everyday person when compared to print advertisements found in magazines and newspapers. The commercials are bright, colorful, and appeal to the consumer on a level not seen before. These commercials are part of what Debord sees as the spectacle. He believes that it creates such a grandiose image of the product that the everyday person gets sucked up in the spectacle and ignores the fact that the product will most likely never live up to the spectacle.</p><p>As television increases its scope and infiltration into households worldwide, it gains a greater audience and connects cultures across the globe. Some people see the connection across cultures as a positive effect. Debord argues the opposite. He believes that the easy mixing of cultural products, concepts, and traditions through media homogenizes individual cultures. When cultures can easily adopt and buy parts of other cultures, they begin to lose their own identities. Families, communities, and nations are able to see what others are doing through the media and seek to adopt the parts of those cultures that most appeal to them. The images viewed on television screens become a spectacle in themselves, and the viewer starts wanting to do or have what they are seeing. The modern day acronym FOMO which is short for &ldquo;fear of missing out&rdquo; is used to describe the feeling people get when they view friends and family via social media doing things they wish they were doing. While there was no social media in Debord&rsquo;s time, the concept of FOMO relates to advertisements and television programming that are designed to elicit the same result. A person watching an advertisement for a product they do not own feels as if they are missing out because the advertisement leads them to believe that everyone else has the product already. The spectacle of the advertisement creates a false narrative and with the assistance of technology is able to reach a significantly larger audience in a much faster way.</p><hr><a href=#summary><h1 id=summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-1><h2 id=summary-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p><em>Society of the Spectacle</em>Â focuses on how human beings have become so technology-driven that they have forgotten how to take in life events through personal experience.Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/key-figure-analysis/#Guy_Debord rel=noopener>Guy Debord</a>Â is not totally against new technology in general. He is more concerned by the use of new technology to encourage people to buy and consume products regardless of whether that consumption is necessary for the consumer.Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/author/ rel=noopener>Debord</a>Â worries that technology will create a society where everyone is connected and engages in unneeded consumption to feel successful compared to their peers.</p><a href=#commodity-fetishism><h3 id=commodity-fetishism><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Commodity Fetishism</h3></a><p>Debord makes many references to Marxist philosophy and commodity fetishism. Commodity fetishism is the view that certain products gain value over both the labor behind them and other commodities that might actually be more important to the physical well-being of society. An example of commodity fetishism can be seen in modern-day culture where the value of a diamond is exponentially higher than the value of fresh water even though fresh water is a basic requirement of human life. Debord explains how media and technology allow powerful corporations to push a narrative on the public. The narrative they want to push includes their product and the need for people to have and consume that product. In the previous example of diamonds, the value placed on diamonds is a narrative devised by the diamond industry to elicit desire. The narrative they push claims that a diamond is the ultimate symbol of love and the larger the diamond, the more love is behind it. Debord argues that when consumers see the advertisements, they begin to believe the narrative and apply it to their own life. This application could then cause a consumer to evaluate their or their peers&rsquo; relationships based on that narrative. If the consumer&rsquo;s diamond is small, they might begin to resent their partner or be envious of their friend who has a larger diamond.</p><a href=#consumer-and-producer-links><h3 id=consumer-and-producer-links><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Consumer and Producer Links</h3></a><p>Debord explores the direct link between mass media and the economy and how that relationship causes an alteration of perception between consumers and producers. He deduces that the media purposely tries to alter what people see, how they interact, and their relationships with one another. He describes how companies have found new ways to build unique aspirations in people&rsquo;s consciousness to create a false sense of need for their products. Debord also believes that the media and big corporations explain the world for people by breaking the barrier of time and distance. The breaking of time and distance gives an impression that the world is ever-connected. Debord believes that when consumers see advertisements and people in other places using products, they feel a sense that the product in the advertisement will connect them to the world at large.</p><a href=#technological-impacts><h3 id=technological-impacts><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Technological Impacts</h3></a><p>Debord believes that present-day technology is dramatically reducing the need for personal interaction. Technology will begin to rewire human behaviors, personal interactions, thoughts, and opinions. This rewiring will leave people at the mercy of the manufacturers&rsquo; point of view. Debord reveals his belief that the mass media and the proliferation of technology have pacified human behavior and steered consumers to regard certain ways of life as the only path to satisfaction. Debord asserts that some kind of action is needed for people to take back their lives from the grip of consumerist society.</p><hr><a href=#chapter-1--the-culmination-of-separation--summary><h1 id=chapter-1--the-culmination-of-separation--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Â Chapter 1 : The Culmination of Separation | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-2><h2 id=summary-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/key-figure-analysis/#Guy_Debord rel=noopener>Guy Debord</a>Â discusses the meaning of separation and how people are removed from real life. They become passive viewers of the spectacle. In postmodernism society&rsquo;s capital has penetrated every aspect of life which leads to alienation.Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/author/ rel=noopener>Debord</a>Â states that people get overwhelmed and just sit back and watch elites and corporations run society. He believes that when people become alienated in every aspect of life, they become separated from their real life. Debord also states that people become isolated from others by economic transactions and glowing screens which leads to &ldquo;lonely crowds.&rdquo; This intrusion of the spectacle in everyday life has a goal. Its goal is to prevent solidarity and collectivism among people. If people do not join together in solidarity, it will lead to a society of millions of individuals who compete with one another and do not trust anyone.</p><a href=#analysis><h2 id=analysis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/key-figure-analysis/#Guy_Debord rel=noopener>Guy Debord</a>Â believes that the isolation created by the spectacle and the economic elites of the world takes away an individual&rsquo;s control in their life. People are no longer in control of their actions because so much of what they see is dictated to the spectacle. When people try to become self-aware of their real life or explore the alienation they feel, they become depressed. They begin to feel that there is no way to regain control of their life because the system creates incredible pressures to keep them locked in and isolated.Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/author/ rel=noopener>Debord</a>Â strongly contends that media and advertising campaigns aim to keep consumers isolated from one another by selling products and ideas that naturally lend to isolation. He claims that &ldquo;its technologies are based on isolation, and they contribute to that same isolation.&rdquo; He believes the ultimate goal of consumer isolation is to prevent people from gathering together, discussing the spectacle, and ultimately rising up against the creators of the spectacle.</p><hr><a href=#chapter-2--the-commodity-as-spectacle--summary><h1 id=chapter-2--the-commodity-as-spectacle--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 2 : The Commodity as Spectacle | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-3><h2 id=summary-3><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/key-figure-analysis/#Guy_Debord rel=noopener>Guy Debord</a>Â posits that the spectacle is the total domination of society by the commodity or consumer good.</p><p>He states that with the domination of the commodity comes control of rationality and exchange value. Quality is disappearing and being replaced by profit and cost-effectiveness. The commodity controls so much of society that it is no longer centered on producing. The consumer becomes the center point in a postmodern society. Corporations have to care about people outside the factory because the spectacle must create a demand for their products.Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/author/ rel=noopener>Debord</a>Â discusses how the automation of factory work has dramatically altered the complexion of the workforce. Debord asserts that even though automation is rapidly replacing workers, the capitalist economy will never transition to full automation because low-skilled laborers need to make wages so they can purchase products within the economy. Debord explains how corporations do not want to pay workers a fair wage because they want to maximize profits. Corporations have to pay them something though because the spectacle needs to keep going and growing. The spectacle steers the economy and the commodities produced, and growth becomes the most important factor.</p><a href=#analysis-1><h2 id=analysis-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/key-figure-analysis/#Guy_Debord rel=noopener>Guy Debord</a>Â theorizes that to get people to listen to an argument about the quality of a product versus the cost and popularity of the product, people would have to organize and protest in a social way. An example of this concept can be found in modern-day movies. Certain movie franchises bring with them an assumed value. The social assumption is that the movie in question must be good, and if a person thinks otherwise, they do not &ldquo;get it.&rdquo; The isolation creates a vacuum, and even if a person views the movie and dislikes it, they will often not divulge their true feelings. It becomes popular to like the movie, and getting people to admit otherwise takes either a massive social intervention or a significant amount of time to pass before people can critique its true value.</p><p>The other important topicÂ 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/author/ rel=noopener>Debord</a>Â discusses is how workers are exploited in the production of goods. Debord believes that corporations need the working class to buy their products, so they need to keep them employed. He posits that if corporations fully automated or drove pay so low that workers did not see any value, then there would not be enough money in the economy to sell their products. Corporations need workers to have just enough to purchase goods but not enough to be able to leave the system entirely and rise up against them.</p><hr><a href=#chapter-3--unity-and-division-within-appearances--summary><h1 id=chapter-3--unity-and-division-within-appearances--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 3 : Unity and Division within Appearances | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-4><h2 id=summary-4><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/key-figure-analysis/#Guy_Debord rel=noopener>Guy Debord</a>Â thinks the society of the spectacle is full of contradictions. Unity and division are everywhere, but most of the time they are thinly veiled. People tend to feel united under the idea of constant consumption and that everyone is in it together.Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/author/ rel=noopener>Debord</a>Â postulates that lying just under the surface is increasing income inequality and class division that threaten to eventually destroy the notion of the spectacle.</p><p>Debord discusses the appearance of selling lifestyles through celebrities, selling leaders like commodities, and selling social status though product brands. He posits that most people know deep down that they cannot and will not ever live a life like a celebrity but feel that if they consume things in a similar way, it will make them appear equal in status. The spectacle also applies to a narrative of people in power. Debord believes the spectacle tries to sell people a narrative about how people in powerful positions that have a lot of money are &ldquo;regular people&rdquo; who came from a similar background to the average person. This narrative tends to lead a person to believe that if they buy the things the powerful person owns, they will find themselves in a position of power as well.</p><p>Debord discusses what he calls pseudo-needs. Pseudo-needs are assumed needs created by the spectacle and are not true human needs like food, water, and shelter. Debord discusses gadgets and how constantly evolving technology can disrupt the system. Technology constantly changes and the current becomes outdated very quickly.</p><a href=#analysis-2><h2 id=analysis-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/key-figure-analysis/#Guy_Debord rel=noopener>Guy Debord</a>Â discusses in detail how things in the capitalist economy that seem like they unite consumers really serve to divide them. If a certain product enters the marketplace and is new and shiny, everyone wants to own it. That desire seems like a uniting factor in the beginning because consumers all want the product. However, if the product is expensive like a luxury car or a high-priced computer, not everyone will have the means to purchase it. The inability to participate in the spectacle leaves the consumer isolated, envious, and resentful. The divisions in social class widen, and people on the lower end of the economic ladder become disenfranchised.</p><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/author/ rel=noopener>Debord</a>Â also explains how the spectacle sells more than just physical commodities. The spectacle also uses the power of celebrity to push both products and lifestyles. The spectacle subtly insinuates that if someone owns certain things, participates in certain activities, or goes to certain places then they will be living a celebrity lifestyle. Debord also believes that powerful people use the spectacle to sell themselves as well as products. If a person of power can sell a narrative that they are just like all the other consumers who are lower on the economic ladder, they can keep the consumers&rsquo; attention by creating a false belief that anyone can climb to the top. Politicians use the spectacle to create the image that they are &ldquo;just like you&rdquo; to get people to vote for them.</p><p>Finally, Debord illustrates how technological gadgets require constant updating to stay relevant, and while that could pose a problem in a spectacle society, corporations have used it to their benefit. When a technology becomes outdated, the manufacturers have to create a new version. The newer version then turns into the spectacle. Consumers are made to feel that if they are still using the &ldquo;older model&rdquo; then they are not part of the group. Debord explains this concept by stating that &ldquo;replacing that necessity with a necessity for boundless economic development &mldr; means replacing the satisfaction of primary human needs with an incessant fabrication of pseudo needs.&rdquo; The best modern example is the yearly updating up smartphones. Each year technology companies bring out a new version of their flagship phones that tout small and incremental improvements. Consumers instantly feel that their current phone is &ldquo;passÃ©&rdquo; and want to purchase the new model even though in most cases their current phone meets their actual daily needs.</p><hr><a href=#chapter-4--the-proletariat-as-subject-and-representation--summary><h1 id=chapter-4--the-proletariat-as-subject-and-representation--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Â Chapter 4 : The Proletariat as Subject and Representation | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-5><h2 id=summary-5><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/key-figure-analysis/#Guy_Debord rel=noopener>Guy Debord</a>Â devotesÂ

<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/author/ rel=noopener>Debord</a>Â critiques various points of Marxism and some of the things he does not agree with. His opinions on Marxism highlight that while Debord was not a fan of capitalism, he was not a true communist either. Debord criticizes Marxism because of its heavy reliance on science and scientific theory. He notes that many critical thinkers lack an understanding of history and become overly dependent on pure science.</p><p>Debord moves on to give his assessment of the USSR government as the capitalist enterprise that Debord believed it truly was. He finishes the chapter by discussing his opinions on the proletariat. He opines that during the time of the essay&rsquo;s publication, society is on the verge of another proletariat uprising. He then goes into detail about how that might look. Debord predicts that people will eventually use the very products that they are being isolated by to band together and rebel against the spectacle that created them.</p><a href=#analysis-3><h2 id=analysis-3><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/key-figure-analysis/#Guy_Debord rel=noopener>Guy Debord</a>Â is a socialist, but he does not adhere to all the tenets of Marxism. He believes in some of the core principles of Marxism that make it a socialist movement, but he does not subscribe to the strict ideas of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. He believes that in places where Marxism is implemented strictly, the bourgeoisie takes advantage and ends up acting more like capitalists who hold all the wealth. He uses the Soviet Union as an example of how Marxism can be counterproductive in its efforts. He points to how the proletariat class in the Soviet Union is controlled by outside forces. He explains by referring to the &ldquo;practice of directing the proletariat from outside, by means of a disciplined underground party under the control of intellectuals.&rdquo;Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/author/ rel=noopener>Debord</a>Â is alluding to the theory that there are people who are loyal to the bourgeoisie and work to control the proletariat.</p><p>Debord believes that the answer to the proletariat problem could be solved by setting up and running workers&rsquo; councils. Debord asserts that the revolutionary organization of proletariat workers and the general working class is important to shine a light on the dangers of the spectacle. If working-class consumers can recognize the extent to which they are trapped and isolated by the spectacle, the closer society will come to overthrowing the spectacle. Debord offers a caveat to his suggestion of workers&rsquo; councils. He postulates that once the spectacle is overthrown and exposed, the revolutionary organization must step down or dissolve to try to prevent the ideology-as-the-goal issue.</p><hr><a href=#chapter-5--time-and-history--summary><h1 id=chapter-5--time-and-history--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 5 : Time and History | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-6><h2 id=summary-6><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/key-figure-analysis/#Guy_Debord rel=noopener>Guy Debord</a>Â argues that time and humankind are really the same. Historical time begins with the true nature of humans.Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/author/ rel=noopener>Debord</a>Â discusses the histories of different societies that range from static societies to the rise of political power as a result of familial-based tribes disappearing. Static societies keep conflict internal and stay stable over generations with little cultural or societal change. Debord talks about the repercussions when a dynasty falls and how that society is thrust back into cyclical time which means living the same thing over and over seasonally. It is not until a new dynasty comes to power that historical time returns to reclaim its position over cyclical time.</p><p>Debord moves into the history of monotheistic religions of the West which he explains are a combination of myth and history. Debord posits that religion and its constant quest to convert and conquer pulls people out of cyclical time and gives them a purpose or something to count down to. He goes on to explain how Christianity becomes inverted religiously because people begin to flaunt their religious righteousness as in physical battles such as the Crusades (1095â€“1291). As society progresses, those physical confrontations become business and moral confrontations. Debord theorizes that the process that Christianity takes lays the groundwork for capitalism. It creates an attitude of capital accumulation and begins to erase the myths of the premodern world. This transition is when society begins its fascination with commodities.</p><p>Debord ends the chapter by theorizing that the owners of capital in the society of the spectacle use the concepts of morality and religion to keep the working class tied to having to produce their goods. Terms like &ldquo;God&rsquo;s work&rdquo; are used to create the aura that work is the most important thing in a person&rsquo;s life and that it is the moral thing to do. A person who resists work is painted as someone who resists morality and ultimately God.</p><a href=#analysis-4><h2 id=analysis-4><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/key-figure-analysis/#Guy_Debord rel=noopener>Guy Debord</a>Â lays bare his feelings on religion and especially his resistance to monotheistic religions. A monotheistic religion is one based on a singular God figure.Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/author/ rel=noopener>Debord</a>Â argues that monotheism was born out of &ldquo;a compromise between myth and history, between the cyclical time that still governed the sphere of production.&rdquo; Debord ties together the rise of Christianity with the foundations of capitalism and the accumulation of commodities. He explores how the Crusades of the middle ages were truly the first real spectacles and the first &ldquo;unnoticed invention.&rdquo; He argues that the Crusades along with the expansion of cities and exploration of the world provided the groundwork for a capitalist society that would eventually lead to the spectacle.</p><p>As societies expanded the term &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; began to shift meanings. Debord states that freedom was not what people thought it was and that it was just &ldquo;unrestricted freedom of trade&rdquo; hidden from the public at large. The entire system of capitalism and trade has twisted time around and erased cyclical time. The day itself is not measured from sunup to sundown but by economic production time. Debord states that &ldquo;what appears the world over as the same day is merely the time of economic production, time cut up into equal abstract fragments.&rdquo; A day is divided similarly across all cultures and time zones and is dictated by the corporate class and the controllers of the means of production. People&rsquo;s day begins in a way that is dictated to them, not because it naturally occurs. In modern societies people do not wake up when the sun rises or when their body clock is ready. They wake up based on a time scheduled created by the producers of the spectacle they are beholden to.</p><hr><a href=#chapter-6--spectacular-time--summary><h1 id=chapter-6--spectacular-time--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 6 : Spectacular Time | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-7><h2 id=summary-7><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/key-figure-analysis/#Guy_Debord rel=noopener>Guy Debord</a>Â continues to explore the concept of time in modern society, but inÂ

He states that production time as the physical time spent working to produce the goods pushed by the spectacle cheapens people and discards their humanity which makes them feel dead inside.Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/author/ rel=noopener>Debord</a>Â believes that corporations try to hide this fact by presenting the illusion that production time is actually cyclical and not created by the owners of capital. Debord feels that production time relates to tradable pieces of time and that it demands a lessening of quality. The lessening of quality however has to appear meaningful for the deception to work. The capitalist-generated cycle of production time is fortified by the natural cycles of day and night. Pseudo-cyclical time is transformed by modern industry into a commodity that can be bought and sold.</p><a href=#analysis-5><h2 id=analysis-5><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/key-figure-analysis/#Guy_Debord rel=noopener>Guy Debord</a>Â supposes that society&rsquo;s consumer culture is mixed with the fact that people are locked into work for a designated amount of time each week. That constrictive schedule creates a pseudo-cyclical time which mimics a traditional society in some ways. However, while it might seem like people&rsquo;s work days are cyclical, they are not an actual cycle of production and consumption for physical subsistence required for survival. In a traditional society, a farmer wakes at sunrise to tend the fields and ends his working day at sundown when he no longer has the necessary light. The commodities he produces however are essential to the survival of his family and the greater community. In the spectacle society, much production and leisure time is taken up producing and consuming products that are not essential but are created to keep the spectacle alive and well.</p><p>This scenario is best evidenced in modern society when looking at leisure activities and holidays. Vacations under the spectacle are not about experiencing real life outside work but are more about appearances. People travel to destinations more for the images and the appearance that they have the ability to travel than for the actual experiences. The concept of appearance has also led to experiences like theme parks. Vacations to places like Disney World or a Caribbean cruise are about the appearance. In many cases people never leave the resort they are staying at and never experience the actual culture of the place they are visiting. Cruise passengers rarely see beyond the sight line of the ship, and visitors to Disney World hardly see what the actual city of Orlando has to offer. Holidays are similar because the consumption of commodities has become the central reason for the holiday. Christmas is all about giving gifts, Halloween is about getting candy and buying costumes, and Valentine&rsquo;s Day was invented because corporations needed a way to entice buyers during the dead of winter.</p><hr><a href=#chapter-7--territorial-domination--summary><h1 id=chapter-7--territorial-domination--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 7 : Territorial Domination | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-8><h2 id=summary-8><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/key-figure-analysis/#Guy_Debord rel=noopener>Guy Debord</a>Â explains how the modern means of production and transportation have unified geographic space by connecting remote places and culture that were previously too distant to trade with. The closing of the geographical gap has caused localization to vanish. When products are localized, theft is only available in a smaller, specific place.Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/author/ rel=noopener>Debord</a>Â believes that beyond modern transit moving goods and services, it has eliminated local geography and replaced it with the spectacle of tourism. Debord feels that tourism is human circulation that turns going to locations into a spectacle. Tourism in Debord&rsquo;s belief is just another form of consumption. Modernization drastically reduces travel by reducing the space or geography from travel.</p><p>Debord also discusses his opinions on the urbanization of society. Urbanization is the process of transforming an area from a rural or suburban area into an urban or city area. Debord states that urbanization is another form of alienation brought on by the spectacle. He believes that urbanization is the freezing of life at a given point.</p><a href=#analysis-6><h2 id=analysis-6><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/key-figure-analysis/#Guy_Debord rel=noopener>Guy Debord</a>Â reinforces the idea of how the spectacle penetrates people&rsquo;s lives with the ultimate goal of isolating the masses.Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/author/ rel=noopener>Debord</a>Â argues that the spectacle is found in every city and town. People see new business and services as a good thing for communities, but Debord postulates that the spectacle makes those businesses and services banal. The spectacle eliminates the genuine authenticity of a place and changes it into a place just like any other. People also get used to that banal feeling and begin to demand it. When a person travels from one state in the United States to another, they often seek out restaurant chains that are familiar to them. Instead of sampling local cuisine that is unique to the area, they go to the place that is familiar and found in every state. Rapid transportation has also allowed people from any culture to sample something that at one time was unique to an area. While that may seem like a positive thing on the surface, the downside is that a person can consume a local product without ever going to the actual place and experiencing the local culture. An example that highlights Debord&rsquo;s argument is the delicacy of Maine lobster. Maine lobster used to be food that someone could only experience by traveling to Maine and eating the crustacean. Since lobsters need to be cooked alive to taste good, it was impossible before modern transportation to have that experience from faraway locations. With the advent of the airplane, people can have Maine lobster shipped to them live at a very substantial cost anywhere around the globe. A person could sample Maine&rsquo;s staple local cuisine without ever going near the state or even the country.</p><p>Debord sees the city as a tool that is used by the spectacle society to isolate and alienate people. While it might seem counterintuitive that a massive city filled with millions of people could be isolating, Debord sees cities as &ldquo;capitalism&rsquo;s seizure of the natural and human environment.&rdquo; The spectacle needs the city to be able to bring people together to produce and consume commodities. It is much easier to sell commodities in large quantities when people are all jammed into a small space and are able to view products everyday with their own eyes. Debord believes that the city is also a delicate balance between control and loss of control. The spectacle needs to control people because having so many people that close together can lead to revolution and revolt. The spectacle needs to make sure that people are under control. Otherwise, the collective mass could turn on the spectacle and those that are behind it as Debord predicts.</p><hr><a href=#chapter-8--negation-and-consumption-within-culture--summary><h1 id=chapter-8--negation-and-consumption-within-culture--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 8 : Negation and Consumption Within Culture | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-9><h2 id=summary-9><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p>InÂ

<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/key-figure-analysis/#Guy_Debord rel=noopener>Guy Debord</a>Â examines several topics including art and social science. He begins and ends the chapter with an evaluation of culture and the effect the spectacle has on it.Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/author/ rel=noopener>Debord</a>Â gives an overall evaluation and explanation of culture in general and how he believes the roles of art, science, and economics play specific roles. Debord then pivots to specifically explain the spectacle and how the critique of art and social science plays an important role. Debord continues by explaining as well as criticizing the American school of structuralism. Structuralism is a method of interpretation and analysis of aspects of human cognition, behavior, culture, and experience. Debord discusses how structuralism is able to justify the society of the spectacle by placing greater importance on the system itself. Structuralism proclaims that the system is more important than the actual function of the system. This perspective gives a justification for the functions within the system because as long as the system is in place, how it works internally is not important.</p><a href=#analysis-7><h2 id=analysis-7><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/key-figure-analysis/#Guy_Debord rel=noopener>Guy Debord</a>Â details ways that the spectacle has influenced art. He details how historical time began to invade art during the Baroque era (1600â€“1750). He also claims that the last true art is now gone and has been replaced by commodities much like many other cultural traditions.</p><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/author/ rel=noopener>Debord</a>Â criticizes the social sciences and more specifically the American school of structuralism. He believes that structuralism is bad science because it is pseudoscience and not true science. Pseudoscience is a set of beliefs that are mistakenly viewed as being based on the scientific method. Structuralism does not delve below the surface of society or explore the issues at the heart of the spectacle. Debord believes that structuralism only views the spectacle on the spectacle&rsquo;s terms. It also uses the same spectacular language that is used to sell the system to consumers. Debord argues that critical theory needs to use its own language that is separate from the language of the spectacle to facilitate a conversation that will lead to exposing the injustices that the system produces. Debord strongly believes that the spectacle will otherwise likely continue to permeate and manipulate human knowledge and modern culture. He observes that the spectacle continues to support and finance scientific knowledge that will support the system itself. He theorizes that the opposite is also true. Scientific knowledge and research deemed meaningless or counter to the spectacle will be discontinued or at most allowed to proceed with insufficient funding and support.</p><p>Debord usesÂ 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/chapter-8-summary/ rel=noopener>Chapter 8</a>Â to explain how the spectacle has infiltrated culture by means of art and knowledge. He considers that art and knowledge are divided and become specifically designed under capitalism and the spectacle. The spectacle creates art as separate from knowledge and designs that art to serve capitalistic goals. Human culture gets detached from society and becomes its own separate form. When art and culture are removed from their respective spheres, the process of cultural imperialism occurs. Cultural imperialism is when a politically or economically dominant culture imposes itself on lesser cultures.</p><p>Debord contends that if the spectacle is allowed to penetrate an individual culture, that culture no longer represents its original intention. He posits that when culture is invaded by the spectacle, it serves the spectacle and in turn validates the spectacle itself. The invasion of the spectacle obscures the true reality of culture. This blurring and veiling of reality makes it nearly impossible for people to see that there are alternatives to the system of the spectacle. Debord underscores the need for culture to be freethinking by trying to discover all possibilities that human culture has to offer. Debord also states that counter to freethinking, the spectacle has a narrow and singular view of the world. The spectacle aims to get people to believe that there is no beginning or end to the spectacle but that it has always existed. The spectacle hopes that the comforting feeling that the current system will never end will also deter people from trying to end the cycle.</p><hr><a href=#chapter-9--ideology-materialized--summary><h1 id=chapter-9--ideology-materialized--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 9 : Ideology Materialized | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-10><h2 id=summary-10><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p>In the final chapterÂ 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/key-figure-analysis/#Guy_Debord rel=noopener>Guy Debord</a>Â somewhat playfully explains how personal and cultural ideology is the foundation of human thought even though ideological facts are not true fact. Ideological facts are stories, knowledge, and experiences that are shared by certain ideologies but are either unprovable or factually untrue. These ideological facts can dramatically affect education and the future generations in a society. Ideology gains legitimacy with victories in art, culture, and science. Once ideological facts claim victory, the ideology mixes into society and erases its historical origins.Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/author/ rel=noopener>Debord</a>Â explains how ideologies are short-lived, with their competition being marked by their dissolving into society and culture. Debord theorizes that the spectacle is ideology that has risen above all the rest. Unlike other ideologies that get absorbed into society, it is able to remain separated and by staying separated remains valid.</p><p>Debord discusses how the modern political and economical culture is designed to produce a single need. The singular need it aims to isolate is money. In the modern political economy, money is the only need. Individual people within the society of the spectacle become isolated from one another. Their isolation becomes complete and is intensified by commercialism and images that the spectacle continues to bombard the isolated person with. This bombardment makes the person feel all the more desperate.</p><a href=#analysis-8><h2 id=analysis-8><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/key-figure-analysis/#Guy_Debord rel=noopener>Guy Debord</a>Â holds the opinion that the spectacle eliminates lived experiences from human life by placing people in a never-ending cycle of appearances. He states that the spectacle alienates people from themselves and others around them. People can relate to one another through the spectacular images that are thrust on society.Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/author/ rel=noopener>Debord</a>Â explains how modern society does not know its own identity because the spectacle has permeated all aspects of people&rsquo;s lives. Debord predicts that the spectacle can drive people who either support or oppose the spectacle to experience mental health issues. He believes that mental health ailments like anxiety and depression will continue to increase as the spectacle causes people to feel that they need to keep up.</p><p>Debord posits that the solution to the grip of the spectacle is true democracy. If the individual people within a society have a direct say, they can begin to remove the veil that has covered their eyes for decades. Once the spectacle is revealed for what it really is, people can begin to make their own choice and live life based on their own personal desires and not the desires that the spectacle has thrust on people.</p><hr><a href=#quotes><h1 id=quotes><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Quotes</h1></a><ol><li></li></ol><p>Â The spectacle is not a collection of images; it is a social relation between people.Â </p><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/key-figure-analysis/#Guy_Debord rel=noopener>Guy Debord</a>,Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/chapter-1-summary/ rel=noopener>Chapter 1</a></p><p>Guy Debord views the spectacle as more than just images. He explains by mentioning that spectacles are not merely an assortment of pictures or videos. The spectacle is the relationship between different people within a given society. Debord believes that those relationships can be between people who have never met as well as people who have more regular interactions. He goes on to describe how spectacles are visual excess, but he states that the matter goes beyond images. Society&rsquo;s worldview is altered to revolve around materialism and consumerism instead of mental and physical well-being. The production of products and the subsequent advertising of them through media changes the very core of society and makes life revolve around the concept of having.</p><ol start=2><li></li></ol><p>Â Identifies with the dominant images of need, the less he understands his own life.Â </p><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/key-figure-analysis/#Guy_Debord rel=noopener>Guy Debord</a>,Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/chapter-1-summary/ rel=noopener>Chapter 1</a></p><p>Guy Debord explains how he considers people in society that are not a part of the production of products to be spectators. Spectators are the members of society that are susceptible to the spectacle because they continue to feel more and more isolated. The isolation increases however as new products continue to come out because the products themselves are inherently isolating. Cars, televisions, computers, and audio devices all separate individuals from the people around them. The spectator continues to view media and spectacles and becomes less and less aware of who they really are. Their true needs and wants are altered to fit the narrative pushed on them by the producers of products. A spectator might desire a brand new pickup truck more because they saw it advertised over and over again than because they actually need a pickup truck for their own life. Debord suggests that the spectator&rsquo;s purchases and habits become less and less their own and more and more the direction the spectacle wants them to go in.</p><ol start=3><li></li></ol><p>Â The spectacle is the leading production of present-day society.Â </p><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/key-figure-analysis/#Guy_Debord rel=noopener>Guy Debord</a>,Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/chapter-1-summary/ rel=noopener>Chapter 1</a></p><p>Guy Debord gives the spectacle a lot of power in his theories about how modern society reacts to commercialism. His belief is that modern society and the production of goods and services are driven by the spectacle created by corporations. The concept is counter to the production of goods and services in the past which was based on the human need for survival. Debord concludes that past economies focused on producing products that would allow people to survive life by feeding, clothing, and sheltering their families. As technology advances, the focus shifts to creating an image of need instead of producing products to fulfill an actual need. Debord points out how the society of the spectacle has transformed products that have no real human need into products that people believe are a need. In that sense the spectacle is what drives the production and not the actual needs of society.</p><ol start=4><li></li></ol><p>Â The reigning economic system is a vicious circle of isolation.Â </p><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/key-figure-analysis/#Guy_Debord rel=noopener>Guy Debord</a>,Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/chapter-1-summary/ rel=noopener>Chapter 1</a></p><p>Guy Debord uses the term &ldquo;isolation&rdquo; to describe products that are produced and sold to consumers through the implementation of spectacles. The products are designed to isolate the consumer and keep them from having true social experiences. Debord mentions the car as an example of an isolating product that is heavily pushed on consumers. A person who used to take public transportation but switches to a new car goes from being around other people for their commute to work to being on their own. The car also contains a radio, and the consumer often turns it on to listen to because of the lack of conversation. Once the radio is on, they are now susceptible to audio advertisements. The more isolated people become, the more they crave being connected to a certain group. Debord posits that when someone is isolated, they will seek ways to become socially connected. The spectacles that consumers view through the media give them a false sense of social connection. Consumers purchase products that they believe will make them more connected socially, but as they purchase more, they become more isolated and the cycle continues.</p><ol start=5><li></li></ol><p>Â The quantitative is what it develops, and it can develop only within the quantitative.Â </p><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/key-figure-analysis/#Guy_Debord rel=noopener>Guy Debord</a>,Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/chapter-2-summary/ rel=noopener>Chapter 2</a></p><p>Guy Debord uses complex language to explain a concept that has been used over and over with regard to products. The simple statement is, &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t make them like they used to.&rdquo; In the earlier 20th century, products were built to last because they were made well. Everything from kitchen appliances to clothing was made so that the consumer had faith that the product would last. Debord explains that as modernization continues, companies abandon higher quality items because things that are built extremely well do not need to be replaced. If corporations simply make their products lower quality however, people will notice. Instead, companies decide to combine lower quality with lower prices and wrap it all up in spectacle. The spectacle of advertising promotes &ldquo;new and improved&rdquo; models to replace the old one. Consumers who used to replace their refrigerator only when it broke for good will be enticed to buy a new one because it has new technology and features. Companies can make products of lesser quality because the spectacle they have created prevents most consumers from realizing how short the product&rsquo;s lifespan is. They are oblivious to it because they replace the products before they show signs that they are not good quality to begin with.</p><ol start=6><li></li></ol><p>Â The fetishism of the commodity &mldr; attains its ultimate fulfillment in the spectacle.Â </p><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/key-figure-analysis/#Guy_Debord rel=noopener>Guy Debord</a>,Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/chapter-2-summary/ rel=noopener>Chapter 2</a></p><p>Guy Debord holds a strong opinion about the fetishism of the commodity and how it dramatically affects how society interacts with the products it consumes. Fetishism of the commodity is the worshipping of an inanimate object for its supposed magic powers. Debord does not actually think that people believe these products to have magical powers, but he posits that people place a hefty weight on the purchasing of those products and what those products might do for them. The fetishism of the commodity can be seen most clearly in the buying habits of middle-school and high-school students. When a new trend created by the spectacle emerges, young people want to be the first in line to own the particular product. Whether it is a brand of backpack, clothing line, or accessory, they feel that their lives, social status, or even circle of friends will be dramatically affected if they have or do not have the latest thing. The spectacle gives a trendy product a power that it does not actually have like the ability to change social status at school or raise a person&rsquo;s economic class. The spectacle has given the product a power that is not real.</p><ol start=7><li></li></ol><p>Â The division it presents is unitary, while the unity it presents is divided.Â </p><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/key-figure-analysis/#Guy_Debord rel=noopener>Guy Debord</a>,Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/chapter-3-summary/ rel=noopener>Chapter 3</a></p><p>Guy Debord dedicates Chapter 3 to how the spectacle simultaneously unites and divides society. He posits however that unlike many situations where unity and division exist, the spectacle contradicts itself purposely to confuse consumers. Consumers assume that by purchasing certain products, they will be united with their peers or with social groups that they are part of or wish to be part of. Debord believes the reality is the opposite. The perceived benefits of the products as being able to unite groups actually divide them. The modern example of FaceTime highlights his theory. Consumers view FaceTime and other video chatting programs as a way to connect to their peers because they have instant access to face-to-face communication no matter where they are. However, Debord would argue that while consumers might communicate more, they interact less. They lose the personal interaction that he believes is crucial for humans to feel united with their peers. His belief in the contradiction also underscores how people become blind to what really unites them. Debord suggests that what consumers believe divides them is actually the one thing that unites them. The spectacle&rsquo;s control over consumers is seen from the outside as a way to divide consumers, but Debord feels it is the one thing that truly unites them. The problem in his view is that people cannot see that the division the spectacle is creating is what should be uniting the consumer class to rise up.</p><ol start=8><li></li></ol><p>Â Behind the glitter of spectacular distractions, a tendency toward banalization dominates.Â </p><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/key-figure-analysis/#Guy_Debord rel=noopener>Guy Debord</a>,Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/chapter-3-summary/ rel=noopener>Chapter 3</a></p><p>When something is banal, it lacks originality and creativity. Guy Debord suggests that as the spectacle culture grows, the products that are produced lack originality. Consumers get so caught up in the hype and the imagery that they forget to deeply analyze the product to see if it is worthwhile. The direction that modern-day movies have taken with reboots and sequels is a keen example of Debord&rsquo;s concept. In the past 20 years, many of the biggest blockbuster movies have not been original stories that are new to the culture. Some of them are derived from books and comics that have been around for decades and even generations. Other movies simply take an older movie and repackage it to look shiny and new. Others just continue an existing franchise. While a sequel sometimes has new storylines, there is no originality in the characters and their development. Debord would see these movies as products, yet people flock to them in droves and review them as if they were fresh on the scene. The spectacle that they have created blinds the spectator and prevents them from seeing the reality.</p><ol start=9><li></li></ol><p>Â The more powerful the class, the more it claims not to exist.Â </p><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/key-figure-analysis/#Guy_Debord rel=noopener>Guy Debord</a>,Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/chapter-4-summary/ rel=noopener>Chapter 4</a></p><p>Guy Debord explains how the wealthy class which includes capitalist corporations gets to a point where it recedes into the background. It does so out of fear that the degree of power and influence that it wields may be exposed. Those in this class claim that the power and wealth do not really exist because they fear a possible backlash. Human beings behave in similar ways to succeed in society. A football player can come from humble beginnings and rise up the ranks to gain status as the best. People love the success story and will cheer a person on up to a point. Once they feel that someone is too successful, the opposite occurs. People begin to root for the person&rsquo;s demise and hope that some new player will topple the champion. Members of the wealthy class do not want to get to the point that the football player got to. They do not want people to root for their downfall, so they step back and pretend not to exist.</p><ol start=10><li></li></ol><p>Â The lost children of this as yet immobile army reappear on this battleground.Â </p><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/key-figure-analysis/#Guy_Debord rel=noopener>Guy Debord</a>,Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/chapter-4-summary/ rel=noopener>Chapter 4</a></p><p>Guy Debord predicts a new social revolution similar to workers&rsquo; protests of the past. He believes that the children of the past social uprisings will be the ones to rebel against the spectacle. He views the consumer class as parallel to the past working classes who rebelled against the wealthy classes. He posits that they will rise up and try to take down the spectacle that has allowed the product market to transform from quality to quantity. Debord&rsquo;s predictions are important to critique for two reasons. The first is that Debord&rsquo;s assumption that the modern consumer would rise up against the spectacle never came to fruition. The current capitalist market is dominated by the spectacle, and Debord would probably argue that it is the most powerful it has ever been. The second reason why it is important to critique Debord&rsquo;s prediction of a modern uprising against the capitalist market is because Debord&rsquo;s other theories have played out exactly as described. Debord&rsquo;s explanation of the spectacle is highly relevant in modern society. In fact, his descriptions can almost be blanketly applied to the 21st century even though his theories predate personal computers, smartphones, the Internet, and other inventions that Debord would probably have viewed as science fiction.</p><ol start=11><li></li></ol><p>Â The time of things, because the weapon that brought &mldr; was the mass production of objects.Â </p><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/key-figure-analysis/#Guy_Debord rel=noopener>Guy Debord</a>,Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/chapter-5-summary/ rel=noopener>Chapter 5</a></p><p>According to Guy Debord, the society of the spectacle measures time more by the production of objects and less by actual human experience. Debord states that the passage of time is marked by products that were previously seen as luxuries and out of reach being mass marketed to the public. Time and history are thus shifted to view benchmarks of time from the lens of production and not pure human history. Technological advances in products fascinate the consumer, and they begin to forget about what is behind the production of goods and how those goods became so important to them. An excellent example of Debord&rsquo;s belief lies in the way modern technology companies release products to the public. Corporate giants like Apple have created a cycle of product releases that form their own time line. Apple for example announces its newest smartphone models in the middle of September each year. Consumers mark their calendars for the annual event so they can view what the newest phones will look like. Apple uses the event as its own spectacle to entice buyers to upgrade their phones which they more than likely purchased only a year prior.</p><ol start=12><li></li></ol><p>Â Biological limitations of the work force &mldr; treated by the modern production system as strictly secondary.Â </p><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/key-figure-analysis/#Guy_Debord rel=noopener>Guy Debord</a>,Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/chapter-6-summary/ rel=noopener>Chapter 6</a></p><p>Guy Debord states that human beings are alive and by that very fact have physical limitations. A person cannot work in a factory 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. They need sleep, nourishment, and time off. Debord asserts that the capitalist system of production put those limitations in second place behind their product output. To keep their jobs, workers are expected to work longer and harder. With so many people entering the workforce at a young age, older workers know that if they cannot keep up, they will be replaced by someone who can work longer and harder.</p><p>Along with his discussion of biological limitations, Debord mentions that replacing the entire workforce with automation would ultimately collapse the system. The companies could produce an amazing amount of products for a fraction of the cost because the labor cost would be almost eliminated. If all those workers were out of a job however, there would be no money flowing through the economy which would eliminate buyers. The corporations would have endless products, but very few people would have the means to purchase them.</p><ol start=13><li></li></ol><p>Â While eliminating geographical distance, this society produces a new internal distance.Â </p><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/key-figure-analysis/#Guy_Debord rel=noopener>Guy Debord</a>,Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/chapter-7-summary/ rel=noopener>Chapter 7</a></p><p>Guy Debord makes another case for the positive and negative happening at once. Just as he believes that the spectacle unites and divides at the same time, he posits that as physical distances between people seem to shorten, emotional distance widens. The advent of video conferencing and social media had not emerged in Debord&rsquo;s time, but they can be applied as modern examples. When a person in the past wanted to socialize, doing so required face-to-face interaction. People had to travel distances for social interaction, but once there the emotional distance was very close. As technology advanced more ways to communicate and socialize electronically and over vast geographical distances appeared. It started with the telegraph and advanced to the telephone. The telephone allowed people to interact in person less often because they could communicate in another way. However, the telephone lacks the spectacle that Debord discusses. There is no image to see. Fast-forward to modern times, and video calls allow a person to hear and see another person without having to leave their location. Distance and even time seem to disappear. A person in the United States can see, hear, and communicate with a person from China, but such advancement comes at a cost. The interaction lacks depth and intimacy, and there are no hugs or handshakes. There is an emotional distance that is hard to quantify, but it slowly adds distance and begins to isolate a person.</p><ol start=14><li></li></ol><p>Â In the struggle between tradition and innovation &mldr; innovation always wins.Â </p><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/key-figure-analysis/#Guy_Debord rel=noopener>Guy Debord</a>,Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/chapter-8-summary/ rel=noopener>Chapter 8</a></p><p>Guy Debord discusses how traditions and ways of the past get trampled by innovations. On the surface it might seem as if Debord is simply talking about machines taking over traditional tasks that were seen as both a means of production and a cultural ritual. An example might be candlemaking. While making candles was a necessary means to produce objects that would provide light when the sun went down, the process of making them by hand was a time for families to get together and perform the production. Debord alludes to this concept, but his main point is how technology has homogenized cultures by mixing different cultures through new products. Instead of adhering to their cultural roots, people adopt products created by corporations as part of their life. With the spread of technology, most cultures have access to the same products which mixes them all together instead of keeping up their past identities.</p><ol start=15><li></li></ol><p>Â Imprisoned in a flattened universe bounded by the screen of the spectacle.Â </p><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/key-figure-analysis/#Guy_Debord rel=noopener>Guy Debord</a>,Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/chapter-9-summary/ rel=noopener>Chapter 9</a></p><p>Guy Debord creates an image of a featureless person who sits alone in their house staring at a screen. Debord uses the term &ldquo;flattened&rdquo; to describe how the spectacle has turned the three-dimensional universe of real life into the two-dimensional perspective viewed through a screen. The term &ldquo;two-dimensional&rdquo; has dual meanings depending on context. In mathematical terms it means something that only consists of two physical attributes of dimension such as length and width. The second definition is applied beyond math and geometry and is defined as something that lacks depth or substance. Put simply, two-dimensional in this context means something superficial. Debord is able to utilize both meanings simultaneously in his description of the spectacle and the screen. The screen and the images on it are by mathematical definition two-dimensional. The images displayed can be measured by their width and their height. While the images themselves are two-dimensional, Debord believes that the content they represent is also two-dimensional. It lacks depth and dimension of truth and reality. The viewer or spectator sees exactly what the producers of the spectacle want them to see. This superficiality of content keeps the spectator in a constant universe that lacks depth. The spectator thus lives in a flattened universe.</p><a href=#symbols><h1 id=symbols><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Symbols</h1></a><a href=#gadgets><h2 id=gadgets><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Gadgets</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/key-figure-analysis/#Guy_Debord rel=noopener>Guy Debord</a>Â uses the term &ldquo;gadget&rdquo; inÂ <em>Society of the Spectacle</em>Â to describe collectable trinkets and promotions given out as part of advertising campaigns. He states that &ldquo;trinkets such as key chains which come as free bonuses with the purchase of some luxury product&rdquo; end up being traded back and forth, each time gaining value to the consumer. He explains that the result highlights how those trinkets that are almost valueless on their own can obtain such demand.Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/author/ rel=noopener>Debord</a>Â continues his explanation by commenting on how &ldquo;those who collect the trinkets that have been manufactured for the sole purpose of being collected are accumulating commodity indulgences.&rdquo; Debord views the gadget as one of the ultimate symbols of the spectacle because of the value that consumers place on items that have no real value. The value is manufactured by the corporations to either sell more gadgets or to convince consumers to buy products that come with the gadgets. Throughout modern culture this spectacle has played out over and over again. In the 1980s and 1990s, almost every kind of children&rsquo;s cereal came with a free toy that was advertised to be in the box. Phrases like &ldquo;collect them all&rdquo; were tossed about to entice children all over the world to try to get their parents to buy the cereal. Once a child had one of the toys, they wanted to get more to complete the collection. To complete the collection however, the parents or consumers had to purchase more of the same brand of cereal.</p><p>The technological gadget also serves as an important symbol because it epitomizes Debord&rsquo;s strong belief that the spectacle unites and divides people at the same time. Debord recognizes that technological gadgets are in a constant state of flux because new technology is always being invented, so gadgets based on technology are always in a state of change. Whether the gadget is an appliance such as a refrigerator or a media consumption device such as a television, Debord believes that the spectacle is ever present. A family saves up money to purchase the latest and best new color television and brings it home to hook up. Television technology changes quickly, and the family&rsquo;s new television is only new and shiny for a year before a bigger, thinner, and better quality model comes out. Debord would suggest that the original television the family bought still meets its needs perfectly, but the spectacle is at odds with that opinion. The television is outdated, and to be happy and part of society, the family needs to get the newest version. However, Debord posits that this scenario also causes social division. Since the family saved to purchase the original television, it does not have the means to upgrade. If a family member meets someone in their life who owns the newest television or they see an advertisement for it, they become envious and downtrodden. They believe that their life is somehow &ldquo;not as good&rdquo; because they do not have the newest model of television. The spectacle has created a division of &ldquo;haves&rdquo; and &ldquo;have nots&rdquo; simply by promoting how great life would be if everyone had the newest of everything.</p><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Society-of-the-Spectacle/author/ rel=noopener>Debord</a>&rsquo;s entire essay revolves around the concept of imagery and the spectacle. The ultimate symbol for the spectacle is embodied in the commercial or advertisement. Debord devotes many pages to the ways in which corporations are able to isolate the consumer and make them commodify things that should not have the type of value being assigned. The product commercial is designed specifically to create a spectacle of the product. It generates a buzz that elevates something that might not have any actual value to something that has extraordinary value. Advertising campaigns employ multiple tactics to create the spectacle. Celebrity culture is one of the most common ways companies create the spectacle. By using a well-known and beloved celebrity personality to endorse a product, they entice consumers to buy the product. Debord claims that the intent is to subtly convince consumers that they will live the celebrity lifestyle if they buy the product. Debord explains celebrity spectacle further by asserting that &ldquo;they embody the inaccessible results of social labor by dramatizing the by-products of that labor which are magically projected above it as its ultimate goals.&rdquo;</p><p>The other way that advertisements are a symbol of the spectacle is the way they use images to create the feeling of being a part of something or being viewed in a certain way. Consumers view advertisements and believe that if they owned the product, they would seem more successful, more popular, or more desirable to another person or group. Examples of the power of advertising campaigns are boundless throughout history, but nothing exemplifies this power more than brand names. A brand name box of chocolate cereal is twice as expensive as the generic kind, but the ingredients are the same. Debord would ask why a person would spend double for the same item, and the answer would be the spectacle. Over the course of decades, the consumer has been led to believe that price directly relates to quality. The brand name can charge more since consumers believe the brand name is higher quality because it is more expensive. Car makers use a similar tactic. Many car manufacturers have a standard vehicle line and a luxury vehicle line. The cars are often built in the same factory, by the same people, and even on the same frame. The luxury model even has a similar body style. However, the luxury model costs thousands and sometimes tens of thousands more. Debord believes consumers are willing to pay so much more for two reasons. The first reason is the assumption that the expensive model must be better quality because it costs more. The perception is that cost directly relates to quality, so the higher cost, the higher quality. The second reason is the spectacle created by the luxury car. The consumer believes that if they own the luxury car, wealthy people will consider them part of their group. The consumer begins to feel like their life is different somehow because of the image of the car.</p><hr><a href=#glossary><h1 id=glossary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Glossary</h1></a><p><strong>bourgeoisie:</strong>Â <em>(n)</em>Â a social order dominated by the middle class who own most of the means of production</p><p><strong>capitalism:</strong>Â <em>(n)</em>Â an economic and political system in which a country&rsquo;s trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit rather than by the state</p><p><strong>commodification:</strong>Â <em>(n)</em>Â the action or process of treating something as a mere commodity</p><p><strong>commodity fetishism:</strong>Â <em>(n)</em>Â the tendency to attribute to commodities a power that really inheres only in the labor expended to create commodities</p><p><strong>consumerism:</strong>Â <em>(n)</em>Â the protection or promotion of the interests of consumers who buy goods and services</p><p><strong>communism:</strong>Â <em>(n)</em>Â a political theory derived from Karl Marx (1818â€“83) that advocates class war leading to a society in which all property is publicly owned and each person works and is paid according to their abilities and needs</p><p><strong>cultural authenticity:</strong>Â <em>(n)</em>Â an analysis of the extent to which an image or spectacle reflects the worldview of beliefs and values and depicts the accurate details of everyday life and language for a specific cultural group</p><p><strong>FOMO:</strong>Â <em>(n)</em>Â acronym for &ldquo;fear of missing out&rdquo; which describes the feeling a person gets when they see others doing something that they are not</p><p><strong>proletariat:</strong>Â <em>(n)</em>Â working-class people who own much less of the means of production than the bourgeoisie</p><p><strong>situationism:</strong>Â <em>(n)</em>Â the theory that human behavior is determined by surrounding circumstances rather than by personal qualities</p><p><strong>spectacle:</strong>Â <em>(n)</em>Â an event or grand imagery that is contemplated based on its visual impact</p><p><strong>static society:</strong>Â <em>(n)</em>Â a society that is mostly stable and transfers its rules and norms from generation to generation without changing its original form</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://potatomat0.github.io/obsidian-public-vault/js/graph.6579af7b10c818dbd2ca038702db0224.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Nhat Hoang Â© 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://potatomat0.github.io/obsidian-public-vault/>Home</a></li><li><a href=http://nhatkothieunang.web.app/>Other hobby links</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/potatomat0/obsidian-public-vault>GitHub</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
