As a movement, it tends to promote the interests of a particular nation (as in a group of people), especially with the aim of gaining and maintaining the nation&rsquo;s sovereignty (self-governance) over its homeland to create a nation-state. It holds that each nation should govern itself, free from outside interference (self-determination), that a nation is a natural and ideal basis for a polity, and that the nation is the only rightful source of political power. It further aims to build and maintain a single national identity, based on a combination of shared social characteristics such as culture, ethnicity, geographic location, language, politics (or the government), religion, traditions and belief in a shared singular history, and to promote national unity or solidarity. Nationalism, therefore, seeks to preserve and foster a nation&rsquo;s traditional culture. There are various definitions of a &ldquo;nation&rdquo;, which leads to different types of nationalism. The two main divergent forms are ethnic nationalism and civic nationalism.</p><p>Beginning in the late 18th century, particularly with the French Revolution and the spread of the principle of popular sovereignty or self determination, the idea that &ldquo;the people&rdquo; should rule is developed by political theorists. Three main theories have been used to explain the emergence of nationalism:</p><p>Primordialism (perennialism) developed alongside nationalism during the romantic era and held that there have always been nations. This view has since been rejected by most scholars, and nations are now viewed as socially constructed and historically contingent.
Modernization theory, currently the most commonly accepted theory of nationalism, adopts a constructivist approach and proposes that nationalism emerged due to processes of modernization, such as industrialization, urbanization, and mass education, which made national consciousness possible.[12][14] Proponents of this theory describe nations as &ldquo;imagined communities&rdquo; and nationalism as an &ldquo;invented tradition&rdquo; in which shared sentiment provides a form of collective identity and binds individuals together in political solidarity.[12][15][16]
A third theory, ethnosymbolism explains nationalism as a product of symbols, myths, and traditions, and is associated with the work of Anthony D. Smith.[10]
The moral value of nationalism, the relationship between nationalism and patriotism, and the compatibility of nationalism and cosmopolitanism are all subjects of philosophical debate.[12] Nationalism can be combined with diverse political goals and ideologies such as conservatism (national conservatism and right-wing populism) or socialism (left-wing nationalism).[4][17][18] In practice, nationalism is seen as positive or negative depending on its ideology and outcomes. Nationalism has been a feature of movements for freedom and justice,[19] has been associated with cultural revivals,[8] and encourages pride in national achievements.[20] It has also been used to legitimize racial, ethnic, and religious divisions, suppress or attack minorities, and undermine human rights and democratic traditions.[12]</p><hr><a href=#criticsism><h1 id=criticsism><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Criticsism</h1></a><p>Critics of nationalism have argued that it is often unclear what constitutes a nation, or whether a nation is a legitimate unit of political rule. Nationalists hold that the boundaries of a nation and a state should coincide with one another, thus nationalism tends to oppose multiculturalism[233] and anti-racism.[217][218] It can also lead to conflict when more than one national group finds itself claiming rights to a particular territory or seeking to take control of the state.[6]</p><p>Philosopher A. C. Grayling describes nations as artificial constructs, &ldquo;their boundaries drawn in the blood of past wars&rdquo;. He argues that &ldquo;there is no country on earth which is not home to more than one different but usually coexisting culture. Cultural heritage is not the same thing as national identity&rdquo;.[234]</p><p>Nationalism is considered by its critics to be inherently divisive, as adherents may draw upon and highlight perceived differences between people, emphasizing an individual&rsquo;s identification with their own nation. They also consider the idea to be potentially oppressive, because it can submerge individual identity within a national whole and give elites or political leaders potential opportunities to manipulate or control the masses.[235] Much of the early opposition to nationalism was related to its geopolitical ideal of a separate state for every nation. The classic nationalist movements of the 19th century rejected the very existence of the multi-ethnic empires in Europe, contrary to an ideological critique of nationalism which developed into several forms of internationalism and anti-nationalism. The Islamic revival of the 20th century also produced an Islamist critique of the nation-state. (see Pan-Islamism)[236]</p><p>At the end of the 19th century, Marxists and other socialists and communists (such as Rosa Luxemburg) produced political analyses that were critical of the nationalist movements then active in Central and Eastern Europe, although a variety of other contemporary socialists and communists, from Vladimir Lenin (a communist) to Józef Piłsudski (a socialist), were more sympathetic to national self-determination.[237]</p><p>In his classic essay on the topic, George Orwell distinguishes nationalism from patriotism which he defines as devotion to a particular place. More abstractly, nationalism is &ldquo;power-hunger tempered by self-deception&rdquo;.[238] For Orwell, the nationalist is more likely than not dominated by irrational negative impulses:</p><p>There are, for example, Trotskyists who have become simply enemies of the U.S.S.R. without developing a corresponding loyalty to any other unit. When one grasps the implications of this, the nature of what I mean by nationalism becomes a good deal clearer. A nationalist is one who thinks solely, or mainly, in terms of competitive prestige. He may be a positive or a negative nationalist—that is, he may use his mental energy either in boosting or in denigrating—but at any rate his thoughts always turn on victories, defeats, triumphs and humiliations. He sees history, especially contemporary history, as the endless rise and decline of great power units and every event that happens seems to him a demonstration that his own side is on the upgrade and some hated rival is on the downgrade. But finally, it is important not to confuse nationalism with mere worship of success. The nationalist does not go on the principle of simply ganging up with the strongest side. On the contrary, having picked his side, he persuades himself that it is the strongest and is able to stick to his belief even when the facts are overwhelmingly against him.[238]</p><p>In the liberal political tradition there was mostly a negative attitude toward nationalism as a dangerous force and a cause of conflict and war between nation-states. The historian Lord Acton put the case for &ldquo;nationalism as insanity&rdquo; in 1862. He argued that nationalism suppresses minorities, places country above moral principles and creates a dangerous individual attachment to the state. He opposed democracy and tried to defend the pope from Italian nationalism.[239] Since the late 20th century, liberals have been increasingly divided, with some philosophers such as Michael Walzer, Isaiah Berlin, Charles Taylor and David Miller emphasizing that a liberal society needs to be based in a stable nation state.[240]</p><p>The pacifist critique of nationalism also concentrates on the violence of some nationalist movements, the associated militarism, and on conflicts between nations inspired by jingoism or chauvinism. National symbols and patriotic assertiveness are in some countries discredited by their historical link with past wars, especially in Germany. British pacifist Bertrand Russell criticized nationalism for diminishing the individual&rsquo;s capacity to judge his or her fatherland&rsquo;s foreign policy.[241][242] Albert Einstein stated that &ldquo;Nationalism is an infantile disease. It is the measles of mankind&rdquo;.[243] Jiddu Krishnamurti stated that &ldquo;Nationalism is merely the glorification of tribalism&rdquo;.[244]</p><p>Transhumanists have also expressed their opposition to nationalism, to the extent that some transhumanists believe national identities should be dissolved entirely. The influential transhumanist FM-2030 refused to identify with any nationality, referring to himself as &lsquo;universal&rsquo;.[245] Furthermore, in The Transhumanist Handbook, Kate Levchuk stated that a transhumanist &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t believe in nationality&rdquo;</p><hr><a href=#sociology><h1 id=sociology><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Sociology</h1></a><p>The sociological or modernist interpretation of nationalism and nation-building argues that nationalism arises and flourishes in modern societies that have an industrial economy capable of self-sustainability, a central supreme authority capable of maintaining authority and unity, and a centralized language understood by a community of people.[150] Modernist theorists note that this is only possible in modern societies, while traditional societies typically lack the prerequisites for nationalism. They lack a modern self-sustainable economy, have divided authorities, and use multiple languages resulting in many groups being unable to communicate with each other.[150]</p><p>Prominent theorists who developed the modernist interpretation of nations and nationalism include: Carlton J. H. Hayes, Henry Maine, Ferdinand Tönnies, Rabindranath Tagore, Émile Durkheim, Max Weber, Arnold Joseph Toynbee and Talcott Parsons.[150]</p><p>In his analysis of the historical changes and development of human societies, Henry Maine noted that the key distinction between traditional societies defined as &ldquo;status&rdquo; societies based on family association and functionally diffuse roles for individuals and modern societies defined as &ldquo;contract&rdquo; societies where social relations are determined by rational contracts pursued by individuals to advance their interests. Maine saw the development of societies as moving away from traditional status societies to modern contract societies.[151]</p><p>In his book Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft (1887), Ferdinand Tönnies defined a Gemeinschaft (&ldquo;community&rdquo;) as being based on emotional attachments as attributed with traditional societies while defining a Gesellschaft (&ldquo;society&rdquo;) as an impersonal society that is modern. Although he recognized the advantages of modern societies, he also criticized them for their cold and impersonal nature that caused alienation while praising the intimacy of traditional communities.[151]</p><p>Émile Durkheim expanded upon Tönnies&rsquo; recognition of alienation and defined the differences between traditional and modern societies as being between societies based upon &ldquo;mechanical solidarity&rdquo; versus societies based on &ldquo;organic solidarity&rdquo;.[151] Durkheim identified mechanical solidarity as involving custom, habit, and repression that was necessary to maintain shared views. Durkheim identified organic solidarity-based societies as modern societies where there exists a division of labour based on social differentiation that causes alienation. Durkheim claimed that social integration in traditional society required authoritarian culture involving acceptance of a social order. Durkheim claimed that modern society bases integration on the mutual benefits of the division of labour, but noted that the impersonal character of modern urban life caused alienation and feelings of anomie.[151]</p><p>Max Weber claimed the change that developed modern society and nations is the result of the rise of a charismatic leader to power in a society who creates a new tradition or a rational-legal system that establishes the supreme authority of the state. Weber&rsquo;s conception of charismatic authority has been noted as the basis of many nationalist governments.[151]</p><hr><a href=#further-reading><h1 id=further-reading><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>further reading:</h1></a><p><a href=/obsidian-public-vault/notes/Han-Ryner-on-Anti-patriotism-theanarchistlibrary rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/obsidian-public-vault/notes/Han-Ryner-on-Anti-patriotism-theanarchistlibrary>Han Ryner on Anti-patriotism - theanarchistlibrary</a></p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://potatomat0.github.io/obsidian-public-vault/js/graph.6579af7b10c818dbd2ca038702db0224.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Nhat Hoang © 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://potatomat0.github.io/obsidian-public-vault/>Home</a></li><li><a href=http://nhatkothieunang.web.app/>Other hobby links</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/potatomat0/obsidian-public-vault>GitHub</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
