a series of essays Barthes wrote in a weekly column published for a French literary magazine. The essays investigate popular culture and the stories revealed in the popular press. Barthes uncovers some common mythical threads running throughout French culture. Part 2 of the book contains his reflections about how and why certain myths have gained hold of the collective imagination. Barthes&rsquo;s <em>Mythologies</em> is credited with pioneering the art of critiquing the mass media to uncover its influence on thought, life, and culture.</p><a href=#perspective-and-narrator><h3 id=perspective-and-narrator><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Perspective and Narrator</h3></a><p><em>Mythologies</em> is a series of essays written using the first-person point of view.

Myths are types of speech that take familiar forms and shape people&rsquo;s understanding of life.</p><a href=#main-ideas><h1 id=main-ideas><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Main Ideas</h1></a><a href=#the-bourgeoisie-ideology><h2 id=the-bourgeoisie-ideology><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Bourgeoisie Ideology</h2></a><p>Roland Barthes conveys the ideas and perspectives associated with the rising middle class known in French as the &ldquo;bourgeoisie.&rdquo; Barthes contends that the media passes along the bourgeois ideology through the use of myths. Myths help to perpetuate bourgeois ideology as if it were the norm or official perspective of the nation. Barthes writes that &ldquo;bourgeois ideology invests in this figure interests which are bound to its very essence: universalism, the refusal of any explanation, an unalterable hierarchy of the world.&rdquo; Barthes alleges that a key feature of bourgeois thinking is its universalism that involves a refusal to acknowledge diverse perspectives. Barthes analyzes the film <em>Lost Continent</em> (1951) about scientists traveling in South Asia and reveals an underlying bourgeois universalism. He writes that the film presents &ldquo;an East formally exotic, in reality deeply resembling the West.&rdquo; The bourgeois way of thinking is presented as if it were common to all people in all places and times. Barthes argues that this amounts to a denial of diversity by means of myth.</p><p>Another feature of bourgeois thinking that Barthes discusses throughout <em>Mythologies</em> is a reliance on common sense. Barthes writes that &ldquo;the war against intelligence is always waged in the name of <em>common sense</em>.&rdquo; Barthes alleges that common sense prioritizes quantitative measures over qualitative ones. The bourgeoisie must measure and weigh everything to determine its value. This results in an oversimplification of complex realities. Barthes provides an example of this oversimplification in &ldquo;Criticism Blind and Dumb.&rdquo; He describes a growing bourgeois trend among theater critics to dismiss plays containing abstract philosophical ideas as incomprehensible. Barthes blames &ldquo;the old obscurantist myth&rdquo; for this resistance to ideas. He writes that &ldquo;an idea is noxious if it is not controlled by &lsquo;common sense.&rsquo;&rdquo; Barthes describes an &ldquo;ideal culture&rdquo; that is bourgeois. He writes that &ldquo;any reservations about culture is a terrorist position.&rdquo; Barthes suggests that the bourgeois ideology demands that it remain the dominant force in popular culture. Barthes attempts to demonstrate the ways that this ideology masquerades as the official and best way to interpret the world.</p><a href=#anti-intellectualism-among-critics><h2 id=anti-intellectualism-among-critics><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Anti-Intellectualism Among Critics</h2></a><p>Roland Barthes suggests that there is a trend developing in France that seeks to demonize intellectualism and concern for abstract ideas. Barthes sees evidence of this trend in the way that popular media outlets dismiss or simplify complex works of art and literature. &ldquo;Criticism Blind and Dumb&rdquo; addresses a French theater critic&rsquo;s dismissal of a play reflecting challenging philosophical themes. Barthes alleges that the critic redefines the role of literary criticism to endorse a mentality of exclusion. Barthes asks &ldquo;why become a critic&rdquo; if complex ideas are inaccessible?</p><p>Barthes writes about the &ldquo;<em>Neither/Nor</em> Criticism&rdquo; that he observes in a French daily newspaper. He discusses a journalist&rsquo;s insistence that literary criticism should be neither &ldquo;reactionary&rdquo; nor &ldquo;political.&rdquo; Barthes blames the source of this &ldquo;double exclusion&rdquo; on an overly simplistic logic that seeks to measure and quantify all things. He suggests that even justice itself is conceived of as a scale balancing two opposing positions whose weight is compared. He contends that ideas are on the chopping block and that they are unfairly labeled &ldquo;reactionary&rdquo; or &ldquo;political.&rdquo; Barthes insinuates that a malignant influence wishes to push an ideology or the science of ideas away in favor of a culture of ease. He sees this force reflected in the middle-class or &ldquo;bourgeois&rdquo; habit of preferring comfort to all other values. Barthes resists this trend in an attempt to defend the importance of complex ideas. Barthes instead champions resistance against any urge to silence political discourse.</p><a href=#myth-as-mask><h2 id=myth-as-mask><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Myth as Mask</h2></a><p>Roland Barthes writes in &ldquo;Myth Today&rdquo; that a myth is like a mask that shields people from direct access to reality. Barthes suggests that the popular imagination consists primarily of stories that take the form of myths that shape the mind. He contends that &ldquo;myth deprives the object of which it speaks of all History.&rdquo; Myth imposes a new concept on an image and drains the image of its particularities. Concepts are consumed directly when a myth is adopted. Barthes maintains that only journalists and mythologists can see myths for what they are. The popular imagination is easily manipulated by the masks that the media parades before it.</p><p>Barthes writes that &ldquo;man in a bourgeois society is at every turn plunged into a false Nature.&rdquo; Myths present concepts that deform reality and issue an illusory view of &ldquo;Nature.&rdquo; Barthes argues that myths are often used to support a specific view of what should be considered normal and natural. Barthes cites advertisements as examples of the introduction of myths aimed at distorting unpleasant realities. He discusses advertisements for laundry detergents that depict powdered detergents as luxurious. The advertisements present the myth of luxury to cover up the unpleasant reality associated with dirty laundry. The myth of luxury is made to appear as if it were natural and representative of the homemaker&rsquo;s fixed reality. The grit associated with the task of doing laundry is displaced by the beauty of the new detergent. The only way to recover reality is to recognize the role that the myth plays in altering the consumers&rsquo; perception. Barthes contends that mythology is the best way to do this. Barthes views mythology as a form of protest against the manipulation of people&rsquo;s understanding of the world. Mythology unmasks reality and is the best method for identifying the sources that seek to distort public opinion.</p><hr><a href=#context><h1 id=context><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Context</h1></a><a href=#semiotics><h2 id=semiotics><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Semiotics</h2></a><p>Semiotics is the term used to describe 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/key-figure-analysis/#Roland_Barthes rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a>&rsquo;s work interpreting the meaning of the signs that appear in popular culture. Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure (1857–1913) is often credited with inventing the style of semiotics that Barthes pursued. De Saussure identified a system for studying signs that distinguished between the linguistic sign and the object signified by it. De Saussure further argued that signs alone lack meaning. De Saussure&rsquo;s view that individual signs gain meaning from the linguistic system as a whole came to be known as &ldquo;structuralism.&rdquo;</p><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/author/ rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> inherited de Saussure&rsquo;s structuralist approach to analyzing signs and their meanings. Barthes added to the structuralist approach by emphasizing the importance of the historical as well as cultural factors that surround the language as a whole. Barthes&rsquo;s <em>Mythologies</em> identifies the important signs that emerge in the popular press in France and engages in a discussion of their wider meanings. His investigation includes references both to France&rsquo;s history as well as to its culture.</p><a href=#structuralism-and-post-structuralism><h2 id=structuralism-and-post-structuralism><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Structuralism and Post-Structuralism</h2></a><p>Structuralism emerged from Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure&rsquo;s (1857–1913) pioneering work in linguistics. Saussure argued that each linguistic sign consisted both of a particular word as well as the concept or object the word pointed to. Saussure insisted that the particular signs within any language are arbitrary. The fact that the word &ldquo;screen&rdquo; is used to refer to a computer is random. Some other word could just as well have been used to point to the same object. The particular letters or sounds in the word do not establish the word&rsquo;s meaning. Saussure insisted that the meaning of a word depends on how the word functions within the language as a whole. In other words meaning is produced from the &ldquo;structure&rdquo; of the entire linguistic system.</p><p>Roland Barthes&rsquo;s work continued Saussure&rsquo;s structuralist project. Barthes&rsquo;s book <em>Mythologies</em> interprets the meaning of particular signs by analyzing their place in French culture and history. Barthes extends Saussure&rsquo;s structuralism by focusing more closely on society and culture as key components of the linguistic system. His book <em>Mythologies</em> expresses Barthes&rsquo;s observations that many popular signs are meaningful only in light of class differences in French society. Barthes writes particularly about the class known as the &ldquo;petit bourgeoisie&rdquo; or middle class. He examines the myths or stories that arise from the experiences of people who are members of the middle class. The social structure becomes the focus of Barthes&rsquo;s exploration of meaning in the popular stories of his day.</p><p>Developments in linguistics in the 1960s increasingly included skepticism about the assumptions associated with structuralism. Barthes traveled to Japan in 1966 and discovered that Japanese culture lacks any concept of ultimate stability or structure from which signs draw meaning. At around the same time, the French philosopher Jacques Derrida (1930–2004) introduced his method of deconstruction. Deconstruction involved examining divisions within language as a way to establish meaning in any text. Derrida&rsquo;s work initiated a rejection of structuralism with its emphasis on the predictable manner in which signs create meaning. Post-structuralism was born out of this rejection of structuralism.</p><p>Post-structuralism denies that language refers to any external reality or truth. Post-structuralism takes aim with structuralism&rsquo;s idea that language is a stable structure that produces signs with reliable meanings. Barthes&rsquo;s book <em>Empire of Signs</em> (1970) expresses his increasingly post-structuralist tendencies to resist the idea that meaning must come from some overarching structure. Barthes&rsquo;s travels in Japan caused him to reconsider his assumptions about language and meaning. Japanese signs often appear meaningful on their own without references to anything external to them. Barthes&rsquo;s later works adopt the post-structuralist call for a more fluid understanding of the concept of meaning.</p><a href=#life-in-france-in-the-1950s><h2 id=life-in-france-in-the-1950s><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Life in France in the 1950s</h2></a><p>Roland Barthes&rsquo;s <em>Mythologies</em> is a series of essays that he wrote about the stories that inform popular culture in France in the 1950s. Barthes adopts an overarching critique of the social structure in France at the time with its growing &ldquo;petit bourgeoisie&rdquo; or lower-middle class. Many of the publications that Barthes examines such as the French <em>Elle</em> fashion magazine and the French news magazine <em>Match</em> target a petit- bourgeois audience. Barthes examines the stories with an eye toward the cultural myths that inform the petit-bourgeois way of thinking. He examines popular bourgeois myths about red wine, steak, and music hall performances to construct a critique of the bourgeois way of life. Barthes looks at the popular political rhetoric in France in the 1950s as well to demonstrate that the same bourgeois myths emerge. Barthes&rsquo;s essays critically examine the class divisions in France in the 1950s by examining the way that myths function to sustain them.</p><hr><a href=#key-figures><h1 id=key-figures><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span> Key Figures</h1></a><table><thead><tr><th>Key Figure</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Roland Barthes</td><td>Roland Barthes (1915–80) was a French semiotician who studied language and symbols.

<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/part-2-summary/ rel=noopener>Part 2</a> contains an extended analysis of myth divided into 11 sections. This study guide covers two or three essays from Part 1 per section and three sections covering Part 2 of the book. The guide contains 23 sections of summary in total.</p><a href=#part-1-mythologies><h3 id=part-1-mythologies><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 1: Mythologies</h3></a><p>Part 1 of <em>Mythologies</em> contains the short essays that 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/author/ rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> wrote for the French literary magazine <em>Les Lettres Nouvelles</em> (1953–57). Barthes describes his aim in a <em>Preface to the 1970 Edition</em> as advancing &ldquo;an ideological critique of the language of the so-called mass culture.&rdquo; He also expresses his goal of &ldquo;dismantling&rdquo; language using semiology or the study of signs. His essays cover a broad array of popular topics including wrestling, wine, the Tour de France bicycle race, movies, and fashion trends. Each essay presents an analysis of the myths that operate to shape public opinion about the specific trend that Barthes examines. 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/symbols/#Wine rel=noopener>Wine</a> is shown to involve myths about health and vitality, and wrestling communicates a story of victory and defeat. Barthes shows how stories about the Tour de France employ language similar to that of ancient epic poetry with a familiar cast of characters. The essays all feature an exploration of particular cultural phenomena in light of the social and historical situation in France in the 1950s. Barthes demonstrates that the media uses myths to represent middle-class or &ldquo;bourgeois&rdquo; views as the norm in each of the popular stories. Barthes contends that mythology is the vehicle by which power is maintained and established by the dominant group. His attempt to expose mythology for what it is highlights the hidden structural inequalities within his society.</p><a href=#part-2-myth-today><h3 id=part-2-myth-today><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 2: Myth Today</h3></a><p>Part 2 of <em>Mythologies</em> contains an extended discussion of Barthes&rsquo;s view that myth is a type of speech that communicates a concept by means of a signifier. This section of the book presents a theoretical analysis of Barthes&rsquo;s project. Barthes&rsquo;s semiology or study of signs builds on the work of the pioneering Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure (1857–1913). Barthes employs Saussure&rsquo;s distinction between a &ldquo;signifier&rdquo; and a &ldquo;signified&rdquo; to argue that myth occurs as a &ldquo;second-order&rdquo; system. Myth begins with a signifier that is the sign formed in a linguistic interaction between a signifier and a meaning. Myth builds on a foundation with an established history and significance. Barthes contends that the myth imposes a new form on a sign by emptying the sign of its prior meaning. He communicates his sense that &ldquo;there is no fixity in mythical concepts: they can come into being, alter, disintegrate, disappear completely.&rdquo; Barthes argues that myth has a use-value and achieves a specific end by &ldquo;stealing language.&rdquo; This is why the myth is the perfect vehicle for promoting a particular political agenda. Myth has the power to make the agenda appear perfectly normal and natural. Only the analyst suspects any duplicitous intentions.

Barthes calls wrestling &ldquo;a spectacle of excess&rdquo; akin to the performances held in ancient theaters. Barthes contends that wrestling is &ldquo;not a sport&rdquo; like boxing but is a &ldquo;performance of Suffering&rdquo; containing gestures that the public expects. Barthes argues that the defeated wrestler is a tragic figure who &ldquo;knows how to cry&rdquo; and &ldquo;has a taste for tears.&rdquo; In the ring and the theater, the physique and costumes anticipate the events that will unfold. Barthes points to specific archetypes among wrestlers such as the <em>&ldquo;salaud</em> (bastard)&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>salope</em> (bitch).&rdquo; The performance is humorous and &ldquo;the subtlest nuances of intense feeling (complacency, entitlement, refined cruelty, retribution) invariably encounter the most explicit signs which can express them triumphantly.&rdquo; Wrestlers are actors expressing sorrow, defeat, pride, and victory in an exaggerated, yet predictable way.</p><a href=#the-harcourt-actor><h3 id=the-harcourt-actor><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;The Harcourt Actor&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/author/ rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> describes the importance of the Harcourt Studios&rsquo; photographs of actors. Barthes writes that &ldquo;The Harcourt actor is a god; gods never <em>do</em> anything, they&rsquo;re caught in repose.&rdquo; Barthes demonstrates that the image of the actor is of one who lives in an &ldquo;ideal town, the Players&rsquo; City, where nothing exists but festivities and love affairs.&rdquo; He contrasts the image of the resting actor from the one of the actor at work on the stage. At work the actor must speak, move, and gesture. While in repose the actor can be silent and at rest.</p><p>Barthes suggests that the angle with which Harcourt photographs are shot are &ldquo;privileged to capture this unearthly beauty.&rdquo; The photographs are headshots in which &ldquo;the face is a fictional object; its impassivity, its divine dough, suspends everyday truth.&rdquo; They intimate a heavenly realm where the actor has direct access to spiritual truths inaccessible to the ordinary person. Barthes believes this is the reason that the Harcourt photo is an &ldquo;initiation rite&rdquo; for young actors trying to make a name for themselves.</p><a href=#analysis><h2 id=analysis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><a href=#in-the-ring-1><h3 id=in-the-ring-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;In the Ring&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/key-figure-analysis/#Roland_Barthes rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> analyzes the mythology associated with wrestling as similar to the mythology associated with Greek tragic theater. In Greek tragic theater the audience could witness the downfall of a morally upright hero at the hands of an impossible fate. Barthes suggests that amateur wrestling offers the same delight to contemporary audiences. The purpose of a wrestling match is not the same as is the purpose of professional sports. Barthes makes it clear that he does not consider it to be a sport but a theatrical performance. Wrestling is so popular because when the audience sees the expected outcome and the bastard gets defeated, they feel instant relief. Wrestling projects the deepest human experiences into the ring and surrounds them with a lighthearted comedic context. The most difficult emotions are made to seem less intimidating and more manageable for the spectators.</p><a href=#the-harcourt-actor-1><h3 id=the-harcourt-actor-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;The Harcourt Actor&rdquo;</h3></a><p>&ldquo;The Harcourt Actor&rdquo; unmasks the myth of the god in a state of divine peace that 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/author/ rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> sees as the driving force behind the trend in popular portrait photography. He contrasts the headshot of the actor with the working public&rsquo;s sense of the body being a burden. Barthes contends that the fact that actors are only photographed from the neck up is meant to indicate that they have no need for legs. He writes that walking is &ldquo;the most trivial, hence the most human gesture.&rdquo; The truncated photograph calls forth the myth of the god that occupies an ideal space for an elite few that is beyond the reach of the masses. Barthes suggests that the Harcourt image is intended to reinforce the distinction between the privileged life of a celebrity and the mundane life of an ordinary person.</p><hr><a href=#part-2--romans-in-the-moviesthe-blue-blood-cruise--summary><h1 id=part-2--romans-in-the-moviesthe-blue-blood-cruise--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 2 : Romans in the Movies–The &ldquo;Blue Blood Cruise&rdquo; | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-2><h2 id=summary-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><a href=#romans-in-the-movies><h3 id=romans-in-the-movies><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Romans in the Movies&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/key-figure-analysis/#Roland_Barthes rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> investigates American director Joseph Mankiewicz&rsquo;s (1909–93) film <em>Julius Caesar</em> (1953). Barthes contends that the actors&rsquo; hairstyles with thick bangs represent &ldquo;Romanity&rdquo; in the film. Barthes writes that &ldquo;these frontal locks flood us with evidence, henceforth there can be no doubt we are in Ancient Rome.&rdquo; He comments that the bangs appear absurd on most of the actors but that the bangs look natural on the star actor Marlon Brando (1924–2004). All of the actors perspire, and Barthes believes that sweat is a sign of their concern for acting morally. He writes that &ldquo;to sweat is to think.&rdquo; Barthes claims that perspiration is an indirect way of signifying the agony of wanting to do the right thing.</p><a href=#the-writer-on-vacation><h3 id=the-writer-on-vacation><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;The Writer on Vacation&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/author/ rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> examines a story published in the conservative French newspaper <em>Le Figaro</em> that contains photographs of professional writers enjoying their vacations. Barthes notes that &ldquo;&lsquo;vacations&rsquo; are a recent social phenomenon&rdquo; that began as a practice among academics who would take extended leaves from work to write. Barthes observes that vacations have now become commonplace and are enjoyed by &ldquo;the proletarian&rdquo; or the working classes as well. Barthes is amused by the notion of a writer on vacation because a writer is &ldquo;a false worker.&rdquo; The &ldquo;labor&rdquo; the writer engages in is of a different character than the ordinary proletarian type of physical labor. The writer is admired by the middle class as a godlike figure &ldquo;whom society puts in a glass case to profit by.&rdquo; Barthes contends that the writer has become a &ldquo;prosaic spectacle&rdquo; characterized by dullness and a lack of imagination.</p><a href=#the-blue-blood-cruise><h3 id=the-blue-blood-cruise><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;The &lsquo;Blue Blood Cruise&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3></a><p>Roland Barthes discusses the cruise that European royalty took with Queen Frederika (1917–81) of Greece aboard the yacht <em>Agamemnon</em> in 1954. Barthes describes the cruise as a form of play by Kings who wish to pretend to be ordinary humans. He writes that &ldquo;in former days, kings disguised themselves as shepherds; nowadays, to wear garments from a chain store for two weeks is for them the sign of that kind of disguise.&rdquo; Barthes notes that kings are bred in much the same way as pedigreed pets. The fact that they are enclosed together on a ship &ldquo;preserves the main variants of the monarchic species.&rdquo; Barthes claims that the royal cruise conjures the myths of the &ldquo;God-King&rdquo; and the &ldquo;King-Object.&rdquo;</p><a href=#analysis-1><h2 id=analysis-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><a href=#romans-in-the-movies-1><h3 id=romans-in-the-movies-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Romans in the Movies&rdquo;</h3></a><p>The signs in the film <em>Julius Caesar</em> (1953) are &ldquo;peculiar to bourgeois art.&rdquo; &ldquo;Bourgeois&rdquo; art is middle-class art characterized by a &ldquo;duplicity.&rdquo; 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/key-figure-analysis/#Roland_Barthes rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> argues that the signs in the film do not straightforwardly point to the meaning that he would assign to them. He claims that usually signs are either intellectual as when a &ldquo;flag signifies a regiment&rdquo; or they are visceral and obvious. <em>Julius Caesar</em> breaks the mold by presenting an &ldquo;illegitimate&rdquo; and &ldquo;pretentious&rdquo; sign. Barthes&rsquo;s interpretation of the meaning of the film advances his critique of bourgeois art and values. Barthes communicates his view that the middle class produces a form of art that eludes and conceals &ldquo;naive truth&rdquo; out of fear.</p><a href=#the-writer-on-vacation-1><h3 id=the-writer-on-vacation-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;The Writer on Vacation&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/author/ rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> uses the lens of the concept of vacationing to explore the middle-class or &ldquo;bourgeois&rdquo; occupation of writing. Barthes expresses his feeling that the photographs in the newspaper of vacationing writers are absurd. He suggests that writing is not a vocation on par with more ordinary vocational forms. He contrasts the life of the writer with the life of the physical laborer. Barthes calls forth the myth of a writer who can &ldquo;exude&rdquo; words without any effort. It is as if the writer is a being who lacks the ability to choose any other occupation because writing is so natural to them. Barthes insinuates that the myth of writing as an imaginary type of labor is part of the contradictory artifice he associates with the middle class.</p><a href=#the-blue-blood-cruise-1><h3 id=the-blue-blood-cruise-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;The &lsquo;Blue Blood Cruise&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3></a><p>Roland Barthes calls the media&rsquo;s coverage of <em>Agamemnon&rsquo;s</em> voyage &ldquo;anecdotal jabber on which the national press intoxicates its readers.&rdquo; Barthes advances a sarcastic interpretation that hints at the mythology associated with the story of Noah&rsquo;s ark from the sacred religious text the Bible. The story revolves around God&rsquo;s request for Noah to place a male and female of each species in a boat to spare them from a flood. Barthes insinuates that a similar event has happened aboard the Queen&rsquo;s yacht. The yacht contains males and females of the royal species preserved from the &ldquo;flood&rdquo; of people not aboard the ship. He pokes fun at the idea of the &ldquo;divine right of Kings&rdquo; that holds that God handpicks the monarchs. Barthes portrays the European royalty as a group of animals God has selected to breed because of their superior genetics.</p><hr><a href=#part-3--criticism-blind-and-dumbthe-poor-and-the-proletariat--summary><h1 id=part-3--criticism-blind-and-dumbthe-poor-and-the-proletariat--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 3 : Criticism Blind and Dumb–The Poor and the Proletariat | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-3><h2 id=summary-3><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><a href=#criticism-blind-and-dumb><h3 id=criticism-blind-and-dumb><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Criticism Blind and Dumb&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/key-figure-analysis/#Roland_Barthes rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> addresses a trend among literary and theater critics of claiming in certain instances that criticism is either useless or impossible. Barthes asks, &ldquo;why do critics periodically proclaim their impotence or their incomprehension?&rdquo; Barthes contends that the act of refusing to issue a critique suggests that a work is so flawed that normal critical methods fail. He notes that this refusal enhances the feeling of power that the audience and the critic experience. Barthes recognizes an &ldquo;old obscurantist myth&rdquo; that privileges &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; at work in instances in which the critic plays &ldquo;blind and dumb.&rdquo; Critics and audiences are perceived as fully capable of recognizing worthy art and the refusal to critique signifies condemnation of the art.</p><a href=#saponids-and-detergents><h3 id=saponids-and-detergents><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Saponids and Detergents&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/author/ rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> discusses the advertising campaigns for detergents in France. Barthes writes that the advertising has been so widespread that detergents &ldquo;are now part of the level of French daily life which the various schools of psychoanalysis would do well to pay some attention to.&rdquo; Barthes points to the campaign for one specific detergent called <em>javel</em> which boasts that <em>javel</em> &ldquo;kills&rdquo; dirt. Barthes contends that the advertising reveals a mythology that depicts dirt as the enemy and cleanliness as a sign of social status. He argues that foam represents luxury and &ldquo;suggests that in the substance from which it issues there is a vigorous seed, a healthy and powerful essence.&rdquo; The foam conceals the harmful active ingredients contained in the chemical detergents and distracts the consumer from their concerns about product safety.</p><a href=#the-poor-and-the-proletariat><h3 id=the-poor-and-the-proletariat><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;The Poor and the Proletariat&rdquo;</h3></a><p>Roland Barthes provides a commentary on the British actor Charlie Chaplin&rsquo;s (1889–1977) decision to donate two million francs to charity. Chaplin&rsquo;s donation was part of the prize he was awarded by the World Peace Council in 1954. The Council was affiliated with the Soviet Communist party which was a political party in the Soviet Union that emphasized equality and the plight of the peasants. Barthes calls Chaplin&rsquo;s donation of the prize money an &ldquo;ultimate joke.&rdquo; He contends that Chaplin associates the poor with the workers known as the &ldquo;proletariat.&rdquo; Barthes claims that Chaplin&rsquo;s films depict &ldquo;epic&rdquo; hunger such as &ldquo;excessive size of sandwiches, rivers of milk, pieces of fruit.&rdquo; Barthes labels Chaplin&rsquo;s political position as ambiguous. He does not wish to adopt the plight of the poor or to endorse it as his cause. His work nevertheless provides a view of &ldquo;the proletarian still blind and mystified, defined by the immediate nature of his needs.&rdquo; Barthes contends that Chaplin&rsquo;s ability to capture the blindness of the poor without becoming affiliated with any group communicates his revolutionary spirit.</p><a href=#analysis-2><h2 id=analysis-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><a href=#criticism-blind-and-dumb-1><h3 id=criticism-blind-and-dumb-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Criticism Blind and Dumb&rdquo;</h3></a><p>&ldquo;Criticism Blind and Dumb&rdquo; considers a specific instance in which a critic in Paris refused to critique a play. The play was about the life of the famous Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard (1813–55). Kierkegaard is associated with the existentialist movement in philosophy that emphasizes the uniqueness of each individual. The fact that the critic refused to critique an existentialist piece can only be interpreted as a veiled rejection of existentialism as a whole. The existentialist maintains that each individual ought to take advantage of their freedom to express their unique perspective on the world. In rejecting the existentialist&rsquo;s work, the critic rejects the claim that each perspective is meaningful and worth trying to understand.</p><a href=#saponids-and-detergents-1><h3 id=saponids-and-detergents-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Saponids and Detergents&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/key-figure-analysis/#Roland_Barthes rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> pokes fun at the &ldquo;massive advertising campaign&rdquo; for the competing detergents available in France. He observes that the ads are based on the myth of cleanliness being akin to godliness. He writes that the abundant foam produced by the new detergents &ldquo;can even be the sign of a certain spirituality.&rdquo; This myth depicts dirt as the ultimate enemy against which &ldquo;housewives&rdquo; and &ldquo;peasants&rdquo; are at war. Barthes associates liquid detergents with peasants and powder detergents with housewives. He reveals a deeper political dimension to the detergent advertising campaigns. The type of detergent a consumer prefers becomes an indicator of their place within society. The peasant comes into direct contact with harsh chemicals, but the foam in powder detergent protects the middle-class housewife from harm.</p><a href=#the-poor-and-the-proletariat-1><h3 id=the-poor-and-the-proletariat-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;The Poor and the Proletariat.&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/author/ rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> makes it clear that there is an important political difference between &ldquo;The Poor and the Proletariat.&rdquo; His commentary on the British actor Charlie Chaplin&rsquo;s (1889–1977) charitable donation reveals this distinction as being significant. The connotations or meanings that surround the term &ldquo;proletariat&rdquo; derive from the use of the term in association with the Soviet Union&rsquo;s Communist party. The word &ldquo;poor&rdquo; does not have the same significance. The fact that Chaplin equates the hungry poor with the working proletariat is important because it indicates a rejection of established political categories. Barthes depicts Chaplin as an anarchist with a revolutionary tendency to resist all affiliation with any political organization. Barthes suggests that Chaplin&rsquo;s refusal to acknowledge the difference between the poor and the proletariat is an artistic form of political resistance.</p><hr><a href=#part-4--martiansconjugals--summary><h1 id=part-4--martiansconjugals--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 4 : Martians–Conjugals | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-4><h2 id=summary-4><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><a href=#martians><h3 id=martians><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Martians&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/key-figure-analysis/#Roland_Barthes rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> discusses the alleged UFO sightings in France. Barthes writes that &ldquo;the mystery of Flying Saucers was at first terrestrial: supposedly the saucer came from the Soviet unknown, that world as deprived of explicit intentions as another planet.&rdquo; Barthes contends that the mythology surrounding the Soviet Union is on par with that which surrounds talk of other planets. He writes that &ldquo;Western mythology attributes to the Communist world the very alterity of a planet.&rdquo; Barthes refers to the Soviet Union&rsquo;s Communist party which seems as foreign to Americans as a Martian from the planet Mars. Barthes thinks that American scientists endow Mars with the same &ldquo;historical determinism&rdquo; as Earth and imagine that progress on Mars is relatable. Scientists imagine that Martians will come as impartial judges to be onlookers to the conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union. Barthes recognizes an anthropomorphism depicting aliens as identical to humans in this myth. He contends that the imagined Mars looks like a &ldquo;petit-bourgeois Earth&rdquo; or a lower-middle class of Martians identical to their American counterparts.</p><a href=#operation-astra><h3 id=operation-astra><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Operation Astra&rdquo;</h3></a><p>&ldquo;Operation Astra&rdquo; launches a critique of the idea that a costly prejudice is too expensive to maintain and should be surrendered when common sense recommends it. Astra is a brand of French margarine. Its advertisement depicts a person appalled by &ldquo;mousse made with margarine.&rdquo; The margarine is then described as &ldquo;delicious nourishment, pleasant-tasting, digestible, economical, always useful.&rdquo; The result is that margarine is shown to be more efficient than butter at achieving its aim. The prejudice against it disappears. 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/author/ rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> contends that there is also a similar myth surrounding opposition to war and to religion. These oppositions are perceived as costly prejudices that must be given up in the face of the apparent efficiency of war and religion.</p><a href=#conjugals><h3 id=conjugals><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Conjugals&rdquo;</h3></a><p>&ldquo;Conjugals&rdquo; investigates some of the celebrity marriages that appeared in stories published by popular media outlets. Roland Barthes considers which myths surface in the discussions surrounding different types of celebrity marriages. The first type is the &ldquo;grand wedding&rdquo; between two equally influential and wealthy people and their families. The grand marriage is a public display of the power and influence of the new couple. Barthes calls this a &ldquo;potlatch&rdquo; wedding after the tradition among indigenous Americans of giving away property and money during grand ceremonies.</p><p>The grand marriage is contrasted with a second type of marriage that occurs between a celebrity and an ordinary person. These kinds of marriages Barthes labels &ldquo;love-stronger-than-glory.&rdquo; They are based on a standard established among the &ldquo;petit-bourgeois&rdquo; or the lower-middle classes. The couple in love will uphold the expectations of members of the lower-middle classes and will settle for a modest life together. Barthes writes that &ldquo;happiness, in this universe, is to act out a sort of domestic confinement.&rdquo; The marital bliss of the petit bourgeois is best expressed with the phrase &ldquo;two hearts, one hearth.&rdquo;</p><a href=#analysis-3><h2 id=analysis-3><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><a href=#martians-1><h3 id=martians-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Martians&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/key-figure-analysis/#Roland_Barthes rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> describes the myth surrounding the idea of &ldquo;Martians&rdquo; as reflecting a &ldquo;psychosis&rdquo; based on the concept of the &ldquo;Double.&rdquo; He writes that &ldquo;here, as always, the Double is ahead, the Double is a judge.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Other&rdquo; who is a stranger completely unlike anything previously encountered is unimaginable to the &ldquo;petit-bourgeois Earth.&rdquo; Barthes contends that the inability to imagine something vastly different is characteristic of the middle class. The coverage of the UFO sightings in the press shows the Martians as &ldquo;Doubles&rdquo; similar to common humans in every conceivable way. Barthes suggests that the middle class suffers from a failure of imagination. Worse yet is its narcissism or inability to recognize anything outside of itself. The middle class is like the self-absorbed Greek mythological character Narcissus who never sees beyond its reflection.</p><a href=#operation-astra-1><h3 id=operation-astra-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Operation Astra&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/author/ rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> articulates a myth at work in the advertisement for the margarine Astra. The myth he exposes reveals that efficiency and expediency are more valuable than anything else. The suggestion he makes is that it is now considered inconvenient to hold a view that runs counter to the most popular and acceptable one. Anyone opposed to margarine is advised to consider what life would be like without it. The assumption is that this situation would be far worse than the current one. The same is true of war and its associated moral problems. Barthes critiques the concept of conformity for the sake of convenience. He acknowledges the difficulty of maintaining moral principles when doing so costs far more than what a person would reasonably wish to pay. Barthes employs language associated with industry to describe the domain of ethics. He does so as a means of demonstrating the absurdity of formulating ethics in economic terms.</p><a href=#conjugals-1><h3 id=conjugals-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Conjugals&rdquo;</h3></a><p>Roland Barthes&rsquo;s analysis of celebrity marriages reveals that social status is the source of the myths that establish the context of marriage. Marriage is an institution with a meaning that depends on the stories that are told about it. Barthes assesses the marriage of a celebrity and an ordinary person and notes that their marriage is based on the &ldquo;love-stronger-than-glory&rdquo; myth. He observes that this type of marriage happens in spite of the fact that the celebrity has the ability to choose a grander union with a famous partner. The fact that the celebrity opts instead for the common type of marriage serves to reinforce the norm that is expected for members of the &ldquo;petit bourgeois&rdquo; or lower-middle class. Barthes writes that the marriage between two members of the petit bourgeois &ldquo;renews the social status quo&rdquo; or reinforces existing societal norms. Fashion magazines such as <em>Elle</em> &ldquo;glorify&rdquo; the &ldquo;slippered introversion&rdquo; of the typical bourgeois couple&rsquo;s &ldquo;enclosed hearth.&rdquo; Their union is a modest alternative to the grandiose and flamboyant conjugal bonds that bind the upper classes.</p><hr><a href=#part-5--dominici-or-the-triumph-of-literaturenovels-and-children--summary><h1 id=part-5--dominici-or-the-triumph-of-literaturenovels-and-children--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 5 : Dominici, or the Triumph of Literature–Novels and Children | Summary</h1></a><p>Share</p><a href=#summary-5><h2 id=summary-5><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p>&ldquo;Dominici, or the Triumph of Literature&rdquo;</p><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/key-figure-analysis/#Roland_Barthes rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> describes the events surrounding the trial of accused murderer Gaston Dominici (1877–1965). Barthes points to the fact that no real evidence was available that could prove this farmer in the southern Alps was a killer. In lieu of evidence, &ldquo;the motives and sequence of actions were reconstructed with a free hand but without the shadow of a doubt.&rdquo; The prosecutor told a compelling and familiar literary story of a criminal mastermind who brutally murdered three people. The story was so convincing, it resulted in Dominici&rsquo;s conviction and a life sentence. The trial was shrouded in controversy. Only years later did it eventually become clear that the judgment was not fair because it was based solely on testimonial evidence. Barthes draws the conclusion that the Dominici trial should serve as a warning to everyone. He writes that all are in danger of &ldquo;being judged by a power which will hear only the language it lends us.&rdquo;</p><a href=#iconography-of-abbé-pierre><h3 id=iconography-of-abbé-pierre><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Iconography of Abbé Pierre&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/author/ rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> discusses the images that accompany media coverage of the French Catholic priest and activist Abbé Pierre (1912–2007). Barthes writes that photographs of Pierre show &ldquo;a fine head, which offers unmistakable signs of apostleship.&rdquo; He likewise observes that Pierre&rsquo;s beard gives him the appearance of a missionary. Barthes thinks that Pierre&rsquo;s &ldquo;quite artless&rdquo; haircut is meant to function as a sign of &ldquo;a being without formal context.&rdquo; The myth of the saint is of a person completely unconcerned with their appearance or with current fashion trends. Barthes finds it amusing that Pierre&rsquo;s fame has turned his haircut into a popular symbol of sanctity. He writes that &ldquo;the zero haircut, then, quite simply <em>means</em> Franciscanism.&rdquo; Franciscanism is the specific type of Catholicism that Pierre practices. It is associated with concern for the poor in the tradition of its namesake St. Francis of Assisi (c. 1181/82–1226).</p><a href=#novels-and-children><h3 id=novels-and-children><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Novels and Children&rdquo;</h3></a><p>&ldquo;Novels and Children&rdquo; examines the coverage of women writers that appears in the popular women&rsquo;s magazine <em>Elle</em>. Roland Barthes expresses his surprise at the way the magazine reports the number of novels each woman has published alongside the number of children each has. He believes that the story in <em>Elle</em> demonstrates that women are encouraged to &ldquo;compensate for your novels by your children.&rdquo; The message sent affirms women&rsquo;s powers to create works of art while at the same time reassuring men that women will continue to prioritize children. Barthes describes &ldquo;the world of <em>Elle</em>&rdquo; as a world in which &ldquo;women are always a homogeneous species&rdquo; defined primarily by their identities as mothers.</p><a href=#analysis-4><h2 id=analysis-4><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><a href=#dominici-or-the-triumph-of-literature><h3 id=dominici-or-the-triumph-of-literature><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Dominici, or the Triumph of Literature&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/key-figure-analysis/#Roland_Barthes rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> demonstrates that the court is a space like any other that is influenced and shaped by dominant mythologies. Barthes assumes that the audience will perceive the court as a neutral and impartial place where each trial is heard in a fair and free manner. Barthes&rsquo;s analysis of the trial of accused murderer Gaston Dominici (1877–1965) casts doubt on this assumption. He contends that literary narratives that juries and judges accept help to shape their judgment of guilt or innocence. Real evidence was lacking in Dominici&rsquo;s case, and this caused an even greater reliance upon the reconstruction of a myth about murder.</p><p>Barthes finds it shocking to realize that the prosecutors &ldquo;steal&rdquo; Dominici&rsquo;s language &ldquo;in the very name of language.&rdquo; Barthes refers to their accounts of Dominici&rsquo;s psychology. The prosecutor attributes pathological characteristics to Dominici based on common narratives that inform clinical psychology practices. Barthes calls the prosecutor an &ldquo;extraordinary storyteller&rdquo; who portrays Dominici the farmer as a criminal mastermind. The prosecutor&rsquo;s account of the murder is so convincing that Dominici is sentenced to life in prison. Barthes notes the importance of the role of language to the outcome of Dominici&rsquo;s case. Barthes&rsquo;s analysis exposes the flaws in the assumption that the language of law straightforwardly captures the truth. Barthes demonstrates that myth impacts legal judgments and the fate of the accused.</p><a href=#iconography-of-abbé-pierre-1><h3 id=iconography-of-abbé-pierre-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Iconography of Abbé Pierre&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/author/ rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> scrutinizes the media&rsquo;s coverage of Catholic priest Abbé Pierre&rsquo;s (1912–2007) charitable work with the homeless. Barthes maintains that Pierre&rsquo;s appearance is intended to make it obvious to the audience that he is a holy man. His hair is cut without attention to style in a manner that has become associated with being a priest. Barthes writes of his shock at the &ldquo;enormous consumption of such signs that the public makes&rdquo; of Pierre. Barthes asks whether Pierre&rsquo;s popularity could serve as proof of the guilt people feel about the lack of justice in the world.</p><a href=#novels-and-children-1><h3 id=novels-and-children-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Novels and Children&rdquo;</h3></a><p>The intended audience for the popular women&rsquo;s magazine <em>Elle</em> is not only women but men as well. Roland Barthes&rsquo;s discussion of an article about professional women writers highlights the fact that the article focuses equal attention on the women&rsquo;s role as mothers. Barthes sees this as important evidence that the myths surrounding motherhood confine women to their secondary status within society. He argues that &ldquo;<em>Elle</em> says to women; you&rsquo;re worth just as much as men; and to men: your wives will never be anything but women.&rdquo; In this context, women&rsquo;s careers are little more than &ldquo;the touching decor of the nursery.&rdquo; Barthes contends that the article in <em>Elle</em> seems to suggest that man is &ldquo;nowhere and everywhere, like a sky, a horizon, and authority.&rdquo; <em>Elle&rsquo;s</em> celebration of women&rsquo;s &ldquo;equality&rdquo; proves instead to be just another sign of their lack of it.</p><hr><a href=#part-6--toysbichon-among-the-blacks--summary><h1 id=part-6--toysbichon-among-the-blacks--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 6 : Toys–Bichon Among the Blacks | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-6><h2 id=summary-6><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><a href=#toys><h3 id=toys><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Toys&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/key-figure-analysis/#Roland_Barthes rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> laments the increasing popularity of artificial plastic toys that are proliferating in France.

Barthes contends that the popular new toys produced using chemical plastics convey to children the idea that everything is disposable. He writes that &ldquo;the French toy <em>always signifies something</em>.&rdquo; 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/symbols/#Plastic rel=noopener>Plastic</a> toys also teach children to learn how to view their place in the world.

What might have been a &ldquo;catastrophe&rdquo; became an &ldquo;ample rupture of the everyday.&rdquo; Barthes explains that the excess water created a spectacular visual effect and never became too unwieldy. The &ldquo;calm&rdquo; waters of the river instead broke free of its banks and shifted &ldquo;from line to plane.&rdquo; Barthes describes the photos of the flood as charming in their depiction of the &ldquo;childish dream of walking on water.&rdquo; Barthes argues that the flood motivated the press to construct a &ldquo;myth of value&rdquo; that described community &ldquo;solidarity&rdquo; and &ldquo;unity.&rdquo; The flood showed that the Parisians were people capable of fortifying, mobilizing, and rebuilding their homes.</p><a href=#bichon-among-the-blacks><h3 id=bichon-among-the-blacks><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Bichon Among the Blacks&rdquo;</h3></a><p>Roland Barthes offers critical commentary on a story that appeared in the popular French magazine <em>Match</em>. The story described a family of academics who visited Africa in search of artistic inspiration. The images in the magazine show the couple&rsquo;s beautiful blond toddler named Bichon sitting among a group of Africans. Barthes explains that the area Bichon visited in Africa was known in France as &ldquo;Cannibal country.&rdquo; The French told wild stories about the &ldquo;savage&rdquo; people of the region. The piece in <em>Match</em> showed that the blond toddler had the power to subdue a group of wild Africans with his charm. Barthes contends that this myth functions as a way of revealing &ldquo;the Black world through the eyes of the white child; everything here looks like a puppet show.&rdquo; Barthes concludes by acknowledging the vast difference between the myths contained in ethnological academic research and the bigoted &ldquo;collective representations.&rdquo;</p><a href=#analysis-5><h2 id=analysis-5><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><a href=#toys-1><h3 id=toys-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Toys&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/key-figure-analysis/#Roland_Barthes rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> compares wooden toys to &ldquo;crude and hygienic&rdquo; plastic and cold metal toys. He makes it clear that he is fond of wooden toys because wood is &ldquo;poetic,&rdquo; soft, and durable. Unlike wood, plastic is made in a lab using toxic chemicals, but metal is chilly and hard. Barthes suggests that the surplus of cheap plastic toys communicates that objects are valuable only for a time. 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/symbols/#Plastic rel=noopener>Plastic</a> toys teach children to view themselves as consumers enjoying the pleasure of continuously replacing one item with another. Ready-made toys require little creative imagination because their function is built into them. The toys turn a child into &ldquo;a little stay-at-home householder&rdquo; who is handed everything and has no need to create anything from scratch.</p><a href=#paris-not-flooded-1><h3 id=paris-not-flooded-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Paris Not Flooded&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/author/ rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> depicts the flooding of Paris in January of 1955, as a visually spectacular event that turned everyday life upside down. He likens the shimmering flood water to the special effects of cinematography. He describes the change of perception that accompanied the displacement of ordinary objects. Images of people in &ldquo;little boats&rdquo; traveling to the stores in a surprisingly &ldquo;more accessible&rdquo; world convey the changes that the flood brought. The myth surrounding the flood is not one of terror and calamity as can be seen in other related meteorological events. What is unique about the Paris flood is the way that the community came together and found a way to navigate in spite of it. Barthes demonstrates that the myths captured by the press helped to shape this narrative of people united by historic flooding. The result was a record containing the story of a peculiar time in January of 1955, when the waters rose and the people in Paris came together.</p><a href=#bichon-among-the-blacks-1><h3 id=bichon-among-the-blacks-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Bichon Among the Blacks&rdquo;</h3></a><p>There is a divide between popular myths about African people and academic research centering on the African continent. Roland Barthes contends that &ldquo;we still live in a pre-Voltairean mentality&rdquo; in reference to the French philosopher Voltaire (1694–1778). Voltaire is associated with the advent of moral progress and the campaign to end bigotry and tyranny. Barthes insinuates that the popular imagination lags behind the forward thinking of intellectuals. Ordinary people cannot recognize the blatant ignorance of the myth of white purity and black savagery depicted in the article in <em>Match</em>. Barthes thinks that Voltaire would have written the story of the blond toddler in Africa using an altogether different myth. He writes that &ldquo;he would imagine some cannibal (or Korean) Bichon contending with the napalmed puppet show of the West.&rdquo; Barthes suggests that it is the West with its chemical weapons rather than Africa that needs a savior.</p><hr><a href=#part-7--a-sympathetic-workerpower-and-cool--summary><h1 id=part-7--a-sympathetic-workerpower-and-cool--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span> Part 7 : A Sympathetic Worker–Power and &ldquo;Cool&rdquo; | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-7><h2 id=summary-7><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><a href=#a-sympathetic-worker><h3 id=a-sympathetic-worker><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;A Sympathetic Worker&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/key-figure-analysis/#Roland_Barthes rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> takes a critical look at the film <em>On the Waterfront</em> (1954) starring the American actor Marlon Brando (1924–2004). The film deals with corruption within the labor unions that protect the rights of longshoremen who work on the ships at the seaport. Barthes contends that the film is neither courageous nor &ldquo;leftist&rdquo; as many have suggested it is. Instead it does little more than reinforce the unjust order associated with the State which &ldquo;is identical with absolute Justice.&rdquo; The audience&rsquo;s obsession with Marlon Brando causes a total identification with the &ldquo;sympathetic worker&rsquo;s&rdquo; plight. The result is that the audience consents to &ldquo;<em>restoration of order</em>&rdquo; instead of rebellion as the best means of tackling Brando&rsquo;s problems with the system.</p><a href=#garbos-face><h3 id=garbos-face><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Garbo&rsquo;s Face&rdquo;</h3></a><p>Swedish American actress Greta Garbo&rsquo;s (1905–90) face is &ldquo;an Idea.&rdquo; 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/author/ rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> contends that her beauty represents the ideal human face &ldquo;in that same realm of <em>amour courtis</em>&rdquo; which is French for courtly love. Courtly love is associated with the history of chivalry when knights would act heroically to win a woman&rsquo;s love. Barthes sees the excessive makeup Garbo wears in <em>Queen Christina</em> (1933) as further evidence of the fact that her face is a symbol of eternal beauty. The presence of wrinkles must be covered for the symbol to continue to represent perfection. Barthes writes of the struggle against &ldquo;that fragile moment when cinema is about to extract an existential beauty from an essential beauty.&rdquo; It is as if Garbo&rsquo;s face is beauty itself in human form.</p><a href=#power-and-cool><h3 id=power-and-cool><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Power and &lsquo;Cool&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3></a><p>Roland Barthes describes the &ldquo;gangster world&rdquo; of crime and detective films.

Barthes does not see the presence of the gun as a threat in these films. He sees the gun instead as &ldquo;argumentative&rdquo; and transformative. It rearranges the situation that the gangster encounters &ldquo;to elude time&rsquo;s closure.&rdquo; Barthes says that the gangster&rsquo;s world is unique because it is a world of actions rather than language.</p><a href=#analysis-6><h2 id=analysis-6><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><a href=#a-sympathetic-worker-1><h3 id=a-sympathetic-worker-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;A Sympathetic Worker&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/key-figure-analysis/#Roland_Barthes rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> details the plight of a &ldquo;conscientious good worker&rdquo; played by the American actor Marlon Brando (1924–2004) in the film <em>On the Waterfront</em> (1954). Barthes remarks that the fact that the film deals with the subject of the labor rights of workers might at first indicate that it is politically progressive or &ldquo;leftist.&rdquo; He argues that this view of the film is mistaken. A closer look reveals that the film does little more than to glorify the status quo or what is deemed normal.</p><p><em>On the Waterfront</em> (1954) depicts &ldquo;a small gang of mobsters&rdquo; who symbolizes the group of people who function as employers. Barthes contends that Brando&rsquo;s problems with the mobsters in charge at work are resolved by enlisting the help of the police and the priests. This aspect of the film suggests that the Church and the police are necessary to mediate the relationship between the worker and the State. Barthes laments the fact that the director Elia Kazan (1909–2003) missed his opportunity to use the film as a way to offer a critique of the State. Barthes imagines an alternative version of the film in which Kazan makes it clear to the audience that they are completely identified with Brando&rsquo;s character. Barthes wants the audience to recognize that their obsession with &ldquo;this new Christ&rdquo; Brando results in their consent to an oppressive order. Barthes expresses his disappointment with the fact that the film merely offers another reason to silently accept the State&rsquo;s power over workers.</p><a href=#garbos-face-1><h3 id=garbos-face-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Garbo&rsquo;s Face&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/author/ rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> labels actress Greta Garbo (1905–90) a &ldquo;Platonic idea of the human creature.&rdquo; Barthes alludes to the Greek philosopher Plato&rsquo;s (c. 428/27–348/47) theory of ideas. Plato wrote about pure ideas that informed encounters with all of the shadows of ideas in the physical world. Barthes calls Greta Garbo&rsquo;s face &ldquo;beauty&rdquo; in its ideal form. He imagines that Garbo represents what it would be for a pure idea to take a human incarnation. Barthes observes that Garbo&rsquo;s face in films is covered in heavy makeup so as to prevent any imperfections from appearing. He describes the appearance of imperfections in terms borrowed from Plato when he writes, &ldquo;the clarity of carnal essences will give way to a lyric expression.&rdquo; Plato describes pure ideas as spiritual &ldquo;essences&rdquo; expressed in the physical world. Barthes sees Garbo&rsquo;s face as a physical object that appears on screen as pure perfection in an untarnished spiritual form. This is what Barthes thinks makes her face so extraordinary.</p><a href=#power-and-cool-1><h3 id=power-and-cool-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Power and &lsquo;Cool&rsquo;&rdquo;</h3></a><p>Roland Barthes employs the philosophical distinction between &ldquo;Logos&rdquo; or logic and &ldquo;praxis&rdquo; or practice. This distinction is more commonly referred to as the difference between thought and deed. Barthes maintains that the gangster&rsquo;s &ldquo;cool&rdquo; consists in the fact that they are never lost in thought or caught up in strenuous conversations. Instead the gangster&rsquo;s actions are executed as gracefully as &ldquo;ballet&rdquo; and without fear or insecurity of any sort. The myth of the gangster reveals that it is &ldquo;cooler&rdquo; to act than to think and that talk is a waste of time. Power is represented by praxis and not logos. Logic is beside the point when the gangster demonstrates composure in the face of the execution of power.</p><hr><a href=#part-8--wine-and-milksteak-frites--summary><h1 id=part-8--wine-and-milksteak-frites--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 8 : Wine and Milk–Steak-Frites | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-8><h2 id=summary-8><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><a href=#wine-and-milk><h3 id=wine-and-milk><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Wine and Milk&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/key-figure-analysis/#Roland_Barthes rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> details the French campaign in 1954 aimed at promoting milk as a healthy alternative to wine. Barthes acknowledges that &ldquo;wine is felt by the French nation to be a possession as much its own as its 360 kinds of cheese and its culture.&rdquo; The French campaign against alcoholism in France was an uphill battle that involved more than just combating an unhealthy habit. Barthes dissects the symbolism associated with wine as &ldquo;a galvanic substance&rdquo; that is &ldquo;capable of reversing states and situations.&rdquo; 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/symbols/#Wine rel=noopener>Wine</a> is to France what tea is to England. Barthes argues that &ldquo;in France intoxication is a consequence, never a goal.&rdquo; The act of drinking wine &ldquo;exalts every kind of atmosphere&rdquo; regardless of the health risks associated with alcohol. The introduction of milk as an alternative can only succeed if milk is endowed with equally powerful mythology. Barthes suggests that milk becomes a sign of innocence and purity and earns its identity as the &ldquo;true antiwine.&rdquo;</p><a href=#steak-frites><h3 id=steak-frites><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Steak-Frites&rdquo;</h3></a><p>The popular French steak and potatoes meal is a sign of sustenance and strength.

The mythology surrounding steak depicts it as elegant.

He ponders the fact that wine has become tied to the French national identity. The French government&rsquo;s campaign to replace wine with milk in 1954 involved public displays of French leaders drinking milk &ldquo;during speeches to the Chamber.&rdquo; The mythology of milk had to displace the lure of wine, and this could only be accomplished by highlighting milk&rsquo;s purity. Barthes describes milk as &ldquo;cosmetic, it fastens, covers up, restores.&rdquo; 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/symbols/#Wine rel=noopener>Wine</a> is the opposite. Wine &ldquo;is mutilating, surgical, it transmutes and brings to birth.&rdquo; The French government understood that milk could only replace wine if its story lured people to it. Barthes uses the story of milk in France to demonstrate the power of mythology to impact people&rsquo;s choices and alter their behavior.</p><a href=#steak-frites-1><h3 id=steak-frites-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Steak-Frites&rdquo;</h3></a><p>The association between steak and fries establishes French national identity.

Even the cheap restaurants offer a &ldquo;shoe-leathery&rdquo; version of steak. Barthes&rsquo;s discussion of steak does not address any ethical concerns surrounding meat that often arise when eating meat becomes the subject of analysis. Also missing is any mention of the health risks associated with eating steak. Barthes&rsquo;s discussion is intended solely as a demonstration of steak as a symbol of being French.

Barthes associates the joys of reading Verne&rsquo;s novels with the joys of childhood and its &ldquo;delight in the finite.&rdquo; Barthes describes the tendency of children to seek confined spaces such as cabins and tents as a &ldquo;continuous gesture of enclosure.&rdquo; Barthes believes that Verne&rsquo;s adventure novel <em>The Mysterious Island</em> (1874) successfully accomplishes &ldquo;the archetype of this dream.&rdquo; Barthes details Verne&rsquo;s description of a submarine called the <em>Nautilus</em> which is a perfectly enclosed habitat. Barthes views Verne&rsquo;s invention of the <em>Nautilus</em> as reflecting his desire to shrink the world into &ldquo;an enclosed space which mankind can comfortably inhabit.&rdquo; Barthes labels this desire &ldquo;bourgeoisie&rdquo; and associates it with the material desires of the middle class. He contrasts this with the French poet Arthur Rimbaud&rsquo;s (1854–91) poem <em>Bateau ivre</em> (1871) which depicts &ldquo;a true poetics of exploration.&rdquo; Barthes views Rimbaud&rsquo;s poem as &ldquo;the really contrary object to Verne&rsquo;s <em>Nautilus</em>.&rdquo;</p><a href=#depth-advertising><h3 id=depth-advertising><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Depth Advertising&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/author/ rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> investigates a trend that he observes in advertisements for skin products that are marketed to women.

Instead the consumer must settle for a generic description of the &ldquo;two warring substances subtly opposed to the advance of &rsquo;essences&rsquo; and &lsquo;principles&rsquo; toward the field of depth.&rdquo; Barthes contends that the two substances at war are water and grease. He calls both &ldquo;morally ambiguous&rdquo; which means that neither is good or bad on its own. The struggle for beauty involves a conflict between water and grease.

Poujade organized a strike among small business owners in 1953 to oppose what he considered to be an unjust policy of taxation. Poujade&rsquo;s rhetoric targeted the &ldquo;petit bourgeois&rdquo; or the French lower-middle class. Barthes describes it as &ldquo;the rhetoric of retaliation&rdquo; that appeals to petit-bourgeois common sense. Barthes accuses the petit bourgeois of being incapable of qualitative evaluations of the world. They are instead forced into a strictly quantitative reality in which an eye is just compensation for an eye and a &ldquo;penny for a penny.&rdquo; The result is an insistence on homogeneity and incapacity for the recognition of difference.

Barthes veils his critique of Verne&rsquo;s imperialistic invention of &ldquo;an excellent novelistic means of glamorizing this appropriation of the world.&rdquo; He compares Verne&rsquo;s literary appropriation to the middle-class or &ldquo;bourgeois&rdquo; habit of material appropriation.</p><p>Verne&rsquo;s description of the boat called the <em>Nautilus</em> communicates the comfort of a vessel that can both navigate and house simultaneously. Barthes hints at a fundamental desire for regression or a return to childhood evidenced both by Verne&rsquo;s <em>Nautilus</em> as well as by bourgeois spending habits. Barthes contrasts his feelings about the <em>Nautilus</em> with his admiration for French poet Arthur Rimbaud&rsquo;s (1854–91) poem <em>Bateau ivre</em> (1871). Barthes sees Rimbaud&rsquo;s poem as celebrating expansion and exploration. By painting Rimbaud&rsquo;s poetry as more mature than Verne&rsquo;s childish fantasies, Barthes recommends a more poetic and less bourgeois approach to life.</p><a href=#depth-advertising-1><h3 id=depth-advertising-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Depth Advertising&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/author/ rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> analyzes the myths that emerge in advertisements for cleaning products and beauty products.

Dialectics in logic involves the movement of thought between opposing ideas which are called the &ldquo;thesis&rdquo; and its &ldquo;antithesis.&rdquo; Barthes labels the dialectic method &ldquo;the capital enemy of this tautological system.&rdquo; Tautologies are statements that appear as truth claims but do not contain new information. Tautologies are true solely by definition. Barthes refers to Poujade&rsquo;s rhetoric as a &ldquo;tautological system&rdquo; because it offers nothing but the maintenance of the social norm in the guise of &ldquo;common sense.&rdquo; Barthes accuses the petit bourgeoisie or lower-middle class of intellectual stagnation and an obsession with material comfort. Barthes contends that Poujade&rsquo;s rhetorical appeal came from Poujade&rsquo;s ability to alleviate the petit-bourgeoisie&rsquo;s fear of change.

Barthes sees the increasing frequency of tautologies as a symptom of a broader resistance to intellectual concerns. Barthes writes that &ldquo;we know the old saws: too much intelligence is ruinous, philosophy is a useless jargon, you must leave room for feeling, intuition, innocence, simplicity.&rdquo; The actress&rsquo;s tautology reveals the reduction of complexity of Racine&rsquo;s plays to discourage the audience from engaging in further contemplation of them.

Barthes suggests a declining popularity in a humanistic worldview that celebrates the human being&rsquo;s power to affect change in the world. The myth surrounding the &ldquo;jet-man&rdquo; incorporates technology and suggests that the jet-man defeats all limitations through gaining control over his human desires. Barthes writes that &ldquo;mythically the jet-man is defined less by his courage than by his weight, his diet, and his habits.&rdquo; His strict control over his body and mind lends the jet-man his superiority over the aviators of the past.</p><a href=#racine-is-racine-1><h3 id=racine-is-racine-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Racine Is Racine&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/author/ rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> describes the press coverage of a performance of Jean Racine&rsquo;s (1639–99) <em>Athalie</em> (1691) in 1955 at the French national theater. Barthes argues that the discussion recorded about the play in the press includes tautologies which are statements that are true by definition. Barthes sees tautologies as &ldquo;always aggressive.&rdquo; They reflect the desire to avoid thought and to &ldquo;play our common sense close to the chest.&rdquo; Barthes believes that Racine is a playwright whose work is complex. Barthes is irritated by the way that the press represents &ldquo;a Racine as &lsquo;concrete&rsquo; as the Internal Revenue Service.&rdquo; He views this as evidence of the increasing popularity of demonizing intellectualism.</p><p>The anti-intellectual trend that Barthes observes in the press causes him to protest that &ldquo;tautology dispenses us from having ideas.&rdquo; He contends that this is the result of an intellectual &ldquo;laziness&rdquo; that has been &ldquo;promoted to the rank of rigor.&rdquo; Tautologies are useless because they do not provide any new ideas. Barthes values intellectual vitality and worries that the press coverage of <em>Athalie</em> reveals a broader anti-intellectualism that is sweeping across France.

Barthes laments the fact that &ldquo;a Papuan witch doctor was not at the Vel&rsquo; d&rsquo;Hiv&rsquo; to describe the ceremony presided over by Dr. Graham under the name of an evangelizing campaign.&rdquo; Barthes sarcastically refers to the historical record of religious attempts to convert the &ldquo;Primitives&rdquo; from their &ldquo;&lsquo;savage&rsquo; cults&rdquo; to the popular religion of Christianity. He makes it clear that he views Graham&rsquo;s appearance in France as similarly patterned. Barthes writes that &ldquo;we recognize in it the three great phases of every religious action: Expectation, Suggestion, Initiation.&rdquo; Billy Graham does not immediately take the stage but instead makes the audience wait to hear his message. There is an entire assembly of &ldquo;hymns, invocations, any number of futile little speeches&rdquo; that precede his grand entrance onto the stage. Barthes finds the speech itself to be lacking. He writes that it &ldquo;stuns us by its platitude, its childishness.&rdquo; Barthes argues that Graham&rsquo;s appearance in France is politically motivated by America&rsquo;s fear of French atheism.</p><a href=#the-dupriez-trial><h3 id=the-dupriez-trial><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;The Dupriez Trial&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/author/ rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> issues a critique of the criminal justice system.

Barthes writes that &ldquo;here we have the example of what Justice regards as criminal causality: the murderer&rsquo;s parents happen to be in the way.&rdquo; The psychologists who testified at the trial alleged that Dupriez murdered his parents out of a &ldquo;rational anger&rdquo; at them for opposing him.

Barthes makes it clear that he finds Graham&rsquo;s message to be unintelligent. Barthes writes that &ldquo;Billy Graham&rsquo;s &lsquo;success&rsquo; manifests the mental fragility of the French petite bourgeoisie&rdquo; or the lower-middle classes who are his fans. The fact that French atheism is now a target for Graham demonstrates that &ldquo;atheism is seen as the incipient phase of Communism.&rdquo; Communism is a political and economic doctrine that opposes private property and inequalities in wealth. The fear of Communism informed American politics in the mid-20th century.

Prosecutors in cases without tangible evidence frequently try to show that the perpetrator intended to commit the crime by establishing a motive. Barthes argues that legal reasoning &ldquo;is of a &lsquo;psychological&rsquo; and thereby &rsquo;literary&rsquo; order.&rdquo; He highlights the importance of the court&rsquo;s narration of a hypothetical scenario in which the crime appears to arise from a &ldquo;reasonable origin.&rdquo; Barthes finds it hard to believe that Dupriez would have killed his parents simply to remove them as obstacles. Certainly murder is not a rational solution to the problem of encountering an obstacle that blocks the preferred course. Barthes maintains that it only matters to so-called &ldquo;Justice&rdquo; that the motive achieves the goal regardless of any unintended negative consequences that follow. Barthes casts a shadow of doubt on the concept of justice by calling it &ldquo;a Justice born in the bourgeois era, and as such trained to rationalize the world.&rdquo; He makes it clear that he sees psychologists as mere handmaidens to the executioners who dispense with true justice in favor of a good story.</p><hr><a href=#part-13--shock-photosthe-tour-de-france-as-epic--summary><h1 id=part-13--shock-photosthe-tour-de-france-as-epic--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 13 : Shock Photos–The Tour de France as Epic | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-13><h2 id=summary-13><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><a href=#shock-photos><h3 id=shock-photos><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Shock Photos&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/key-figure-analysis/#Roland_Barthes rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> considers a gallery exhibit of photography intended to surprise viewers. Barthes notes that many of the photographs contained in the exhibit do not have the desired shock effect because they are &ldquo;over-constructed&rdquo; and obvious. Barthes writes that &ldquo;capture of the unique moment appears gratuitous, too intentional, the product of an encumbering will to language, and these successful images have no effect on us.&rdquo; Barthes contends that photographers who leave nothing to the imagination present images that contain their personal analysis and interpretation. Photos that shock the audience are genuinely surprising because their meaning is initially inaccessible. Barthes argues that painters are more successful at capturing the &ldquo;numen&rdquo; or the subtle aspects of a scene that can evoke intense emotions. Shock photos are &ldquo;too intentional for photography and too exact for painting.&rdquo; Barthes concludes that the result is that the photos intended to shock the audience do little more than make the photographer seem scandalous.</p><a href=#two-myths-of-the-theater><h3 id=two-myths-of-the-theater><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Two Myths of the Theater&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/author/ rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> contrasts the new &ldquo;bourgeois&rdquo; or middle-class theater with the old theater. Barthes asserts that &ldquo;the new theater angrily inherits the myths of the old.&rdquo; Actors in the past were expected to &ldquo;seethe at all costs&rdquo; and to make their passion believable. The same myth applies to actors in the new theater. The new theater simply adds a more visceral dimension by encouraging visual displays of the actors&rsquo; efforts. Barthes offers an example from a recent prize-winning play in which &ldquo;two male partners spread themselves in liquids of all kinds, tears, sweat, and saliva.&rdquo; The result is that the audience felt that they had experienced something worth the money they paid for their tickets. The second inherited myth emerges when directors of the new theater insist on novel &ldquo;finds&rdquo; for staging plays. Barthes suggests that directors realize that audiences want novelty and that the bourgeoisie audiences demand visual novelty. Barthes claims that the audience will be more likely to feel satisfactorily compensated for their time and money if they witness something unusual on stage.</p><a href=#the-tour-de-france-as-epic><h3 id=the-tour-de-france-as-epic><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;The Tour de France as Epic&rdquo;</h3></a><p>Roland Barthes describes the prestigious Tour de France bicycle race in the language of epic poetry.

Others seem to be &ldquo;beloved of the gods&rdquo; and can count on the ability to &ldquo;leap&rdquo; and take the lead. Barthes contends that the tour includes &ldquo;the epic necessity of ordeal.&rdquo; The course spans wide geography with mountains and valleys that challenge the riders to demonstrate their power to confront &ldquo;Nature-as-substance.&rdquo; The riders sometimes embrace. At other times they hurl insults at one another. Their saga unfolds before an audience witnessing this &ldquo;heroic world.&rdquo; Barthes compares the epic tale of the Tour de France with the Greek poet Homer&rsquo;s (c. 8/9 BCE) <em>Odyssey</em> (c. 675–725 BCE) in which the hero &ldquo;Ulysses reached the ends of the Earth several times.&rdquo; The story of the Tour de France shows the riders&rsquo; struggle to reach the end of a rigorous and grueling course. Barthes describes the Tour as &ldquo;an uncertain conflict of certain essences; nature, customs, literature, and rules.&rdquo; Barthes includes a &ldquo;characterial lexicon&rdquo; where he analyzes each of the central characters in the 1955 race and demonstrates a detailed typology.</p><a href=#analysis-12><h2 id=analysis-12><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><a href=#shock-photos-1><h3 id=shock-photos-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Shock Photos&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/key-figure-analysis/#Roland_Barthes rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> introduces an idea that he attributes to the German dramatist Bertolt Brecht (1898–1956). Brecht&rsquo;s work criticized the rising middle-class or &ldquo;bourgeois&rdquo; values that he observed reflected in popular art. Brecht&rsquo;s plays inspired a detached and critical perspective in the audience that motivated deeper philosophical and political thinking.</p><p>Barthes contrasts Brecht with the photographers whose &ldquo;shock photos&rdquo; are on display. Barthes contends that the &ldquo;shock photos&rdquo; fail to cause shock because they demand nothing of the audience. They leave nothing to the imagination and instead contain too much detail to inspire any reaction whatsoever. Barthes argues that Brecht&rsquo;s plays do a better job of shocking the audience by demanding &ldquo;critical catharsis&rdquo; of the buried emotions that his plays evoke. Great art captures what Barthes calls the &ldquo;numen&rdquo; or the elusive spiritual truths that motivate artists to create.

Barthes contends that the myths of the new theater are actually inherited from the old and that the new and old are scarcely distinguishable. He argues that actors in both the new and old theater aim to achieve believable performances. In the new bourgeois theater, believability and acting talent must be quantifiable and measurable. He writes that &ldquo;passion, too, becomes a merchandise like any other, an object of commerce inserted in a numerical system of exchange.&rdquo; The audience is satisfied with their purchase of the theater ticket only if they witness &ldquo;real tears, real sweat.&rdquo; The conclusion Barthes arrives at is that the myths of the old theater regarding acting and directing talent reappear in the new. The only difference is that these myths manifest in the new theater in a visual and physical rather than a subtle and intellectual form.</p><a href=#the-tour-de-france-as-epic-1><h3 id=the-tour-de-france-as-epic-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;The Tour de France as Epic&rdquo;</h3></a><p>Roland Barthes describes the famous Tour de France bicycle race as a saga.

Barthes claims that initiation into the race requires a memorable nickname. He writes that &ldquo;Bobet becomes Louison, Lauredi becomes Nello&rdquo; and the racers&rsquo; distinct identities are presented to the public. The competitors battle in the tent which is &ldquo;the public threshold where the warrior elaborates his intentions.&rdquo; The race poses the &ldquo;necessity of ordeal&rdquo; that characterizes all great epic sagas. The terrain contains mountains and passes that are spoken of as if they were either humans and gods. Barthes describes the cyclist&rsquo;s challenge as to courageously &ldquo;vanquish the dragon.&rdquo; A cyclist can rely only upon their physical body and the hope that &ldquo;the gods inhabit him and he works wonders.&rdquo; Barthes contends that the Tour de France owes its prestige to the structure of epic drama and a compelling storyline.

Barthes mockingly observes a preference for mountains and gorges over plateaus and plains in the <em>Guide.</em> Barthes writes that &ldquo;a trip according to the <em>Blue Guide</em> is revealed as an economic management of work.&rdquo; He contends that the <em>Guide&rsquo;s</em> mythology refers to the birth of the middle class in an earlier century. Barthes argues that the <em>Guide</em> promotes famous monuments and &ldquo;types&rdquo; of people unique to each location. He asserts that the <em>Guide</em> for Spain describes Spaniards as tradesmen, mountaineers, gardeners, and sailors. Barthes observes that all political and historical details are stripped from the <em>Guide</em> and it offers &ldquo;a cultural alibi as &rsquo;escapist.&rsquo;&rdquo; Barthes imagines that a more contemporary version of the <em>Guide</em> would reveal an entirely different &ldquo;Spain&rdquo; than the one depicted in the current version.</p><a href=#agony-columns-2><h3 id=agony-columns-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Agony Columns&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/author/ rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> calls journalism a &ldquo;technocracy&rdquo; that divides the world into concrete subjects and assigns an expert to cover each area.

The female columnist delicately handles &ldquo;moral cardiology&rdquo; by displaying &ldquo;an eternal youth of the Heart&rdquo; alongside ample experience. Barthes claims that the column divides women into &ldquo;three classes, of distinct status: <em>puella</em> (virgin), <em>conjunx</em> (wife), and <em>mulier</em> (unmarried woman, widow, adulteress).&rdquo; The column describes women&rsquo;s problems as primarily connected to their experiences with men in the context of the family.

He writes that &ldquo;the fine morality of the Middle Party ends up with a new dichotomy quite as simplistic.&rdquo; Barthes alleges that the critic writing in <em>L&rsquo;Express</em> is guilty of assuming that certain words are prejudiced while others are not. Barthes contends that this dichotomy is naive and fails to recognize the biases built into all linguistic expressions. Barthes writes that &ldquo;we may quite safely challenge anyone&rsquo;s ever exercising an <em>innocent</em> criticism.&rdquo; He communicates his sense that the critic&rsquo;s call to only employ language that is neutral is an impossible request.

<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/author/ rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> contends that the purpose of having strippers perform dances in which they undress is to &ldquo;desexualize&rdquo; women. He argues that striptease is advertised as a means of exorcising perceived &ldquo;evil.&rdquo; Barthes notes that the ritual of striptease requires elaborate costumes such as &ldquo;furs, fans, gloves, feathers, fishnet stockings.&rdquo; He argues that luxurious accessories &ldquo;surround man with a magical decor&rdquo; and are an essential feature of the context of the performance. Barthes does not believe that the strippers&rsquo; dances are erotic. He writes that &ldquo;here the faintly rhythmic undulation exorcises the fear of immobility.&rdquo; He sees the dance as a way of hiding nakedness. Barthes contrasts the dancers of France&rsquo;s famous cabaret Moulin-Rouge with amateur strippers to demonstrate that eroticism is &ldquo;domesticated&rdquo; by the professional dancers. Striptease becomes a &ldquo;familiar&rdquo; feature of popular French entertainment.</p><a href=#the-new-citroën><h3 id=the-new-citroën><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;The New Citroën&rdquo;</h3></a><p>Advertisements for the popular French car called the Citroën reveal a change in orientation.

Barthes comments that &ldquo;such spiritualization can be discerned in the importance, the quality, and the actual substance of the glazed surfaces.&rdquo; He notes the change of the car&rsquo;s emblem from arrows to wings. Barthes contends that this reflects a &ldquo;humanized art&rdquo; and a &ldquo;change in automobile mythology.&rdquo; No longer is the car a symbol of power. It is now &ldquo;more <em>domestic.</em>&rdquo; The new dashboard looks more like a kitchen table than a control room.

He contends that this black and white style of thinking is too elementary to adequately capture the complexity of reality. Barthes observes bourgeois logic in an article in the French news magazine <em>L&rsquo;Express</em> where the writer issues a plea for impartiality. Barthes interprets the writer as requesting that all criticism be &ldquo;neither reactionary nor Communist, neither gratuitous nor political.&rdquo; He suggests an image of a scale holding &ldquo;dubious words&rdquo; on one end and &ldquo;light, pure, immaterial&rdquo; words on the other. Barthes shares his feeling that this type of thinking doesn&rsquo;t work when applied to the examination of language. He alleges that &ldquo;the <em>Neither/Nor</em> critics are indeed committed to a system, which is not necessarily the one to which they proclaim allegiance.&rdquo; Barthes insinuates that the critics are ignorant of their biases and unintentionally promote the popular ideology of the middle class.</p><a href=#striptease-1><h3 id=striptease-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Striptease&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/author/ rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> evaluates the erotic dances associated with stripping in light of the myths surrounding nudity. Barthes argues against the popular understanding of the striptease dance as an erotic performance intended to sexually please an audience. Instead he contends that striptease reflects a rejection of women&rsquo;s sexuality and resistance to the expression of true eroticism. He writes that &ldquo;the accessories of the music hall, here mobilized without exception, also constantly alienate the revealed body.&rdquo; Barthes suggests that the dancers&rsquo; elaborate costumes are a way of situating the female body within the context of &ldquo;luxurious objects.&rdquo; He maintains that the function of striptease is to objectify nakedness and to turn it into a commodity that can be bought and sold. The commodification of nakedness enables society to &ldquo;exorcise&rdquo; sexuality and to &ldquo;domesticate&rdquo; eroticism. Barthes concludes that nakedness is thereby stripped of its forbidden essence. It is instead &ldquo;nationalized&rdquo; as a French pastime and a &ldquo;household propriety.&rdquo;</p><a href=#the-new-citroën-1><h3 id=the-new-citroën-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;The New Citroën&rdquo;</h3></a><p>The mythology associated with the automobile in France is changing. The newest version of the popular Citroën auto features a dashboard that resembles &ldquo;the worktable of a modern kitchen.&rdquo; Roland Barthes observes that this is indicative of a larger shift away from stories of the automobile&rsquo;s &ldquo;power&rdquo; and toward stories about its comforts. Barthes insinuates that this change is due to the influence of the lower-middle-class or the &ldquo;petit-bourgeois&rdquo; consumers. He claims that the petit bourgeois have &ldquo;annexed&rdquo; the car as part of their ongoing quest to acquire novel items. Barthes describes the showroom for automobiles as an arena where &ldquo;the object is totally prostituted.&rdquo; Barthes mocks the fascination with objects that he claims characterize the middle class. The new Citroën is just the latest item trending on petit-bourgeois wish lists.</p><hr><a href=#part-17--literature-according-to-minou-drouetlost-continent--summary><h1 id=part-17--literature-according-to-minou-drouetlost-continent--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 17 : Literature According to Minou Drouet–Lost Continent | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-17><h2 id=summary-17><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><a href=#literature-according-to-minou-drouet><h3 id=literature-according-to-minou-drouet><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Literature According to Minou Drouet&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/key-figure-analysis/#Roland_Barthes rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> describes the story of Minou Drouet (b. 1947) who was a child alleged to have written poetry published by the French publishing house Julliard. Doubt emerged as to whether the eight-year-old child in fact authored the poetry. Many demanded that her skills be proved legitimate. Barthes offers his opinion about the affair which he calls &ldquo;a new example of that illusory detective science.&rdquo; He contends that the &ldquo;&lsquo;poetic&rsquo; riddle&rdquo; can only be solved with an adequate understanding of &ldquo;what childhood is and what poetry is.&rdquo; This requires a linguistic analysis rather than a police investigation. Barthes notes that the whole affair reveals a view of the child as &ldquo;an asocial being&rdquo; completely immune to &ldquo;all trace of &lsquo;culture.&rsquo;&rdquo; Barthes argues that the Drouet affair brought the myth of the genius into the spotlight. The myth of genius has transformed over time. Barthes claims that &ldquo;the triumph of the bourgeoisie&rdquo; or the middle class makes childhood appear more glamorous now than it ever has before.</p><a href=#electoral-photogeny><h3 id=electoral-photogeny><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Electoral Photogeny&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/author/ rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> analyzes the use of &ldquo;photogeny&rdquo; which is another word for &ldquo;photography&rdquo; in election campaigns. Barthes calls into question the &ldquo;hypothesis that photography has a power of conversion.&rdquo; Barthes alleges that photographs of candidates reveal only their motives for running and add no substantial information of use to voters. He suggests that photographs of the candidates add details about their social position and their community affiliations. Candidates are glorified in their photos. Barthes contends that &ldquo;it is this glorification which quite precisely defines <em>photogeny</em>: the elector finds himself simultaneously expressed and heroized.&rdquo; Barthes argues that certain candidate types emerge in photographs. Voters choose between the &ldquo;intellectual,&rdquo; the &ldquo;well fed,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;distinguished&rdquo; candidates. Barthes observes an upward gaze trending in recent photography. He describes the upward gaze as &ldquo;raised toward a supernatural light&rdquo; which presents an image of the candidate as godlike and powerful.</p><a href=#lost-continent><h3 id=lost-continent><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Lost Continent&rdquo;</h3></a><p>Roland Barthes provides a critique of a &ldquo;full-length documentary on &rsquo;the East.&rsquo;&rdquo; The film depicts &ldquo;some vague ethnographic expedition&rdquo; in the Malay Archipelago of Southeast Asia. The ethnographers researching the area &ldquo;are fine fellows, occupying their leisure with childish diversions.&rdquo; Barthes sarcastically describes their lack of concern for sociological or historical issues. He contends that the film irresponsibly depicts a false perspective of Asia that makes it appear as similar to the West. Barthes alleges that the film emphasizes &ldquo;the identity of all religions&rdquo; and blurs important differences. He writes that the film displays &ldquo;a superior catholicity&rdquo; or Christianity which is the major religion of the West.

He argues that the mythology that emerged in discussions about Drouet&rsquo;s poetry revealed a &ldquo;bourgeois&rdquo; or middle-class view of childhood and of literature. Barthes alleges that the bourgeoisie endow childhood with &ldquo;a special status, a kind of ineffable and intransmissible essence.&rdquo; Barthes suggests that Drouet&rsquo;s case is &ldquo;an admirable object&rdquo; because it presents a child prodigy who produces adult poetry. The myth involves the idea that the prodigy outsmarts time and accelerates life achievements. Barthes writes that the story of the child prodigy &ldquo;fulfills the ideal function of all capitalist activity: to gain time.&rdquo; Barthes concludes that Drouet is &ldquo;the victim&rdquo; of society &ldquo;sacrificed so that the world will be bright.&rdquo; Barthes does not see Drouet&rsquo;s poetry as reflective of actual poetic talent. He claims Drouet&rsquo;s poetry instead reflects a specific myth of genius which complements the bourgeois dream of enhanced productivity.</p><a href=#electoral-photogeny-1><h3 id=electoral-photogeny-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Electoral Photogeny&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/author/ rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> mocks election &ldquo;photogeny&rdquo; also called &ldquo;photography.&rdquo; Barthes dissects the electoral candidates&rsquo; photographs to reveal that they are merely self-congratulatory fabrications. Barthes jokes that the photographs of a candidate invite the candidate &ldquo;to elect himself.&rdquo; Barthes finds that there is little variation in the images distributed by the candidates. Specific types of people are represented in each. Barthes insinuates that candidates who embody more than one type of person gain an advantage. He alleges that &ldquo;photography here constitutes a veritable blackmail by moral values: country, army, family, honor, fighting trim.&rdquo; Barthes concludes that election photographs serve only to cheapen the entire election by reducing the politicians to familiar character types.</p><a href=#lost-continent-1><h3 id=lost-continent-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Lost Continent&rdquo;</h3></a><p>Roland Barthes includes his thoughts about the history of &ldquo;assimilation&rdquo; which he associates with the major Western religion of Christianity. He references Christianity&rsquo;s legacy of attempting to convert the non-Christian world to its system of beliefs. Barthes insinuates that the attempt to convert non-Christian people to a Western religion is a veiled means of erasing their history. Barthes argues that disregard for differences is a feature of the West&rsquo;s involvement on the Asian continent. Barthes calls <em>Lost Continent</em> &ldquo;irresponsible&rdquo; for depicting Southeast Asia as if it were identical to the familiar Western world. He alleges that the film intentionally erases historical and religious differences. It is not a surprise to Barthes that the title acknowledges the loss of the continent. Barthes laments the fact that <em>Lost Continent</em> appears to mindlessly depict the loss of Southeast Asia&rsquo;s history and diversity for the sake of entertainment.</p><hr><a href=#part-18--astrologyplastic--summary><h1 id=part-18--astrologyplastic--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 18 : Astrology–Plastic | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-18><h2 id=summary-18><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><a href=#astrology><h3 id=astrology><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Astrology&rdquo;</h3></a><p>What does the world look like through the lens of the astrology forecast in the French magazine for women <em>Elle</em>?

Barthes alleges that &ldquo;this is precisely what bourgeois art rejects; it always wants to treat its consumers as naive customers for whom it must chew up the work.&rdquo; The trend Barthes observes in middle-class art is toward the accumulation of too much detail. Barthes argues that music should instead &ldquo;produce the nuance from an internal zone.&rdquo; The addition of the &ldquo;fuss over each detail&rdquo; is absurd and unwelcome.</p><a href=#plastic><h3 id=plastic><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Plastic&rdquo;</h3></a><p>Roland Barthes describes an exhibition featuring a variety of types of plastic.

<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/symbols/#Plastic rel=noopener>Plastic</a> is involved in the construction of cheap reproductions of &ldquo;diamonds, silks, feathers, silvers.&rdquo; Plastic&rsquo;s value is in its use alone unlike the inherent value that precious natural materials exhibit.</p><a href=#analysis-17><h2 id=analysis-17><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><a href=#astrology-1><h3 id=astrology-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Astrology&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/key-figure-analysis/#Roland_Barthes rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> introduces both a critique of the French magazine <em>Elle</em> as well as a critique of contemporary literature. Barthes demonstrates the way that the astrology forecast in <em>Elle</em> targets the &ldquo;petit-bourgeois household&rdquo; or lower-middle-class family. He contends that the forecast is polite and suggests only minor and predictable future events. Barthes claims that the forecast reveals that family and work are the most important parts of women&rsquo;s lives. There is little mention of friendship or community involvement. This leads Barthes to conclude that &ldquo;it joins the ranks of semialienation&rdquo; as little more than &ldquo;pure description.&rdquo; Barthes places literature into the same category. He writes that &ldquo;literature, which in its degraded forms can go no further than to name the experience of our lives.&rdquo; The veiled charge is that literature devoid of creativity participates in the alienation of middle-class women. What has vanished in &ldquo;the ranks of semialienation&rdquo; is the power of imagination and the freedom Barthes associates with genuine creativity.</p><a href=#the-bourgeois-art-of-song-1><h3 id=the-bourgeois-art-of-song-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;The Bourgeois Art of Song&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/author/ rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> calls &ldquo;bourgeois&rdquo; or middle-class styles of music &ldquo;comical.&rdquo; He writes specifically of the popular French singer Gérard Souzay (1918–2004). Barthes mentions Souzay&rsquo;s performance of a song that included the French words for &ldquo;horrible sadness&rdquo; which Souzay exaggerated with a dramatic decrease in tempo. Barthes asks why it is that Souzay didn&rsquo;t just allow the words to speak for themselves. Barthes hypothesizes that the &ldquo;phonetic pointillism&rdquo; in Souzay&rsquo;s style of enunciating every syllable reflects the bourgeois mistake of thinking of great art &ldquo;as an additive series of accumulated, i.e., fully signifying details.&rdquo; Barthes suggests that the analytic tendency overtakes the creative one in middle-class taste. Artists are judged using numerical quantities. Those who explain more and offer additional details are rendered better. Barthes instead recommends a return to &ldquo;trust in music&rsquo;s immediately definitive substance&rdquo; which speaks for itself.</p><a href=#plastic-1><h3 id=plastic-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Plastic&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/symbols/#Plastic rel=noopener>Plastic</a> involves the mythology of the &ldquo;telluric substance&rdquo; with the infinite power of &ldquo;transformation.&rdquo; Roland Barthes employs a distinction between the artificial and the natural to articulate the significance of an ongoing exhibit on plastic. He contrasts plastic with natural substances such as crystals, diamonds, and silver and labels plastic &ldquo;prosaic&rdquo; meaning commonplace. Barthes associates &ldquo;the triumphant sleekness of Nature&rdquo; with luxury items, but plastic is associated with the &ldquo;disgraced&rdquo; and &ldquo;lost.&rdquo; Plastic is a &ldquo;household material&rdquo; that Barthes jokingly imagines might one day replace &ldquo;the whole world.&rdquo; Barthes employs plastic as a symbol of the &ldquo;household,&rdquo; but Nature is a symbol of the &ldquo;ancestral function.&rdquo; Barthes&rsquo;s critique of plastic is also a subtle critique of the rise of the bourgeoisie middle-class whom Barthes associates with disposable plastic.</p><hr><a href=#part-19--the-great-family-of-manat-the-music-hall--summary><h1 id=part-19--the-great-family-of-manat-the-music-hall--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 19 : The Great Family of Man–At the Music Hall | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-19><h2 id=summary-19><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><a href=#the-great-family-of-man><h3 id=the-great-family-of-man><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;The Great Family of Man&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/key-figure-analysis/#Roland_Barthes rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> critiques a photography exhibit called &ldquo;The Family of Man&rdquo; featured at the French Musee d&rsquo;Art Moderne in 1956.

The first stage involves highlighting the diversity between different groups of humans. The second stage then &ldquo;magically&rdquo; introduces unity. Barthes writes that &ldquo;there is now some understanding that there is deep inside each one of us an identical &rsquo;nature.&rsquo;&rdquo; This &ldquo;human essence&rdquo; is described as identical and introduces God into the explanation for the unity of humankind. Barthes argues that the historical details surrounding each human life are unique and that they should not be stripped away in the name of &ldquo;family.&rdquo;</p><a href=#at-the-music-hall><h3 id=at-the-music-hall><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;At the Music Hall&rdquo;</h3></a><p>The music hall portrays &ldquo;the aesthetic form of work.&rdquo; Labor appears beautiful in the acrobatics and dance performances occurring in the hall.

Barthes points to the interruption of time that happens during music hall performances as the best way to &ldquo;serve gesture.&rdquo; Barthes contends that the purpose of entertainment is &ldquo;to remove gesture from its sweetish pulp of duration, to present it in a superlative, definitive state, to give it the character of pure visuality.&rdquo; Barthes expresses his preference for balancing acts because they objectivize the body &ldquo;gently&rdquo; and represent it as &ldquo;a soft, dense substance, responsive to very slight movements.&rdquo;</p><a href=#analysis-18><h2 id=analysis-18><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><a href=#the-great-family-of-man-1><h3 id=the-great-family-of-man-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;The Great Family of Man&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/key-figure-analysis/#Roland_Barthes rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> calls into question the legitimacy of the &ldquo;myth of the human &lsquo;community&rsquo;&rdquo; on display in an exhibit at the French Musee d&rsquo;Art Moderne in 1956. Barthes alleges that the purpose of the myth of the human family is to paint over the historical and cultural differences between people to demonstrate a fundamental human essence. Barthes takes aim at this essentialist approach to history because he fears that it is motivated by a search for an &ldquo;alibi&rdquo; for wrongdoing. Barthes introduces the example of Emmett Till (1941–55) who was &ldquo;the young black murdered by white men.&rdquo; The two white men who kidnapped and killed Till were acquitted of the charges and set free by an all-white male jury (1955). Barthes remarks that Emmett Till&rsquo;s parents are unlikely to share a positive view of the human family after their experience of racist hatred and injustice.</p><a href=#at-the-music-hall-1><h3 id=at-the-music-hall-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;At the Music Hall&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/author/ rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> scrutinizes the myth of work that he sees operating in the performances held &ldquo;at the music hall.&rdquo; Barthes traces the legacy of the music hall to &ldquo;Protestant myths of labor.&rdquo; Protestantism is a particular form of the major world religion of Christianity. Protestantism is alleged to have introduced the idea that God favors hard work which is known as the &ldquo;Protestant work ethic.&rdquo; Barthes insinuates that people experience pleasure when they witness a performance that transforms work into a beautiful and graceful gesture.</p><p>Barthes maintains that &ldquo;the music hall is an Anglo-Saxon phenomenon, born in the world of abrupt urban concentrations.&rdquo; The fascination that the audience feels when they watch the dancers and acrobats performing in the hall is due to &ldquo;the sublimation of labor by its magical effacement.&rdquo; The grit and difficulty of work are disguised by the ease and grace of the performance. Barthes sees this as representing freedom from the &ldquo;artifice of cities.&rdquo; Cities are crowded and filled with &ldquo;a continuation of solid, shiny objects.&rdquo; The music hall displays the opposite. Music hall performances &ldquo;<em>think</em> matter in a spectacular fashion.&rdquo; The boredom and dullness of the ordinary life of work disappear as the dancers take the stage.

Barthes maintains that the play is not about love but &ldquo;Recognition.&rdquo; He notes that the protagonist Marguerite &ldquo;loves in order to be recognized.&rdquo; Barthes contends that this explains why Marguerite depends entirely on others to experience a sense of purpose in life. He writes that Marguerite &ldquo;lives in the consciousness of her alienation.&rdquo; Barthes contends that Marguerite embraces the &ldquo;courtesan&rsquo;s&rdquo; legend of the prostitute. Marguerite is devoted to a middle-class or &ldquo;bourgeois&rdquo; lover named Arnaud whose attention communicates &ldquo;an elevated bourgeois sentiment.&rdquo; Barthes claims that Marguerite&rsquo;s voluntary enslavement to Arnaud represents &ldquo;an alienated lucidity&rdquo; because Marguerite is aware that she is not free. Barthes argues that Marguerite&rsquo;s condition is neither comic or tragic. He writes that &ldquo;the fatality which hangs over Marguerite is social.&rdquo; Marguerite consents to her subjugation simply because of the social benefits that her association with the bourgeoisie provides.</p><a href=#poujade-and-the-intellectuals><h3 id=poujade-and-the-intellectuals><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Poujade and the Intellectuals&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/author/ rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> investigates the concept of the &ldquo;intellectual&rdquo; in conservative French politician Pierre Poujade&rsquo;s (1920–2003) book <em>J&rsquo;ai choisi le combat</em> (<em>I Have Chosen to Fight</em>) (1956). Barthes notes that Poujade endorses a myth of the intellectual as a being who &ldquo;soars, he does not &lsquo;stick&rsquo; to reality.&rdquo; Barthes connects &ldquo;reality&rdquo; with the &ldquo;ground&rdquo; which &ldquo;signifies at one and the same time race, rurality, province, common sense, the numberless obscure.&rdquo; Pojade&rsquo;s anti-intellectualism involves &ldquo;the suspicion of language, the reduction of all adverse speech to a noise, in accord with the constant procedure of petit-bourgeois polemics.&rdquo; Barthes argues that Poujade&rsquo;s rhetoric appeals to the &ldquo;petit bourgeois&rdquo; or the lower-middle class.</p><p>Poujade portrays the intellectual as a &ldquo;thinking machine&rdquo; who is more like a robot than a human. Barthes writes that Poujade&rsquo;s book &ldquo;engenders monsters&rdquo; who are idle intellectuals paid to &ldquo;do nothing.&rdquo; Physical strength and physical labor are thereby promoted above all forms of mental labor. Barthes observes that &ldquo;physical plenitude establishes a kind of moral clarity.&rdquo; Poujade describes intellectuals as physically weak and incapable and unwilling to contribute their fair share.

Barthes alleges that the popularity of Dumas&rsquo;s play indicates that the protagonist Marguerite Gautier is a character who is familiar to the audience. Marguerite is a glorified prostitute who seeks the love of a middle-class or &ldquo;bourgeois&rdquo; man named Arnaud. Barthes alleges that Marguerite wishes to elevate her low social status by winning Arnaud&rsquo;s companionship. Barthes writes that &ldquo;Marguerite Gautier&rsquo;s alienation by the class of her masters is not fundamentally different from that of today&rsquo;s petit bourgeois in a world just as classified.&rdquo; Barthes interprets Marguerite as representing people who belong to the lower-middle class or &ldquo;petit bourgeois.&rdquo; He suggests that lower-middle-class people are forced to prostitute themselves in order to advance socially. Barthes contends that Marguerite &ldquo;spreads to the whole of her public the contagion of her blindness.&rdquo; Marguerite enters into her subjugation willingly and voluntarily because she sees no possible alternative. Barthes imagines that the more revolutionary author Bertolt Brecht (1898–1956) would have made Marguerite into &ldquo;a source of criticism&rdquo; for the audience. Barthes suggests that Dumas&rsquo;s play fails to awaken the audience to the larger social problems surrounding the alienating influence of class differences.</p><a href=#poujade-and-the-intellectuals-1><h3 id=poujade-and-the-intellectuals-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Poujade and the Intellectuals&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/author/ rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> dissects the anti-intellectual sentiments expressed in French politician Pierre Poujade&rsquo;s (1920–2003) book <em>J&rsquo;ai choisi le combat</em> (<em>I Have Chosen to Fight</em>) (1956). Barthes discovers in Poujade&rsquo;s rhetoric the myth of a physically inferior intellectual whose head is in the clouds. Barthes notes that &ldquo;Poujade himself very rapidly developed the legend of his own physical strength.&rdquo; Poujade&rsquo;s athleticism is visible in his attractive physique. He pits himself against the contrary type of person who is the physically weak but mentally strong intellectual. Poujade&rsquo;s physical strength symbolizes his willingness to defend &ldquo;the <em>little guys</em>&rdquo; against those at the top. Barthes argues that this is why Poujade is popular among the &ldquo;petit bourgeois&rdquo; or the lower-middle class. Barthes alleges that Poujade&rsquo;s rhetoric indicates that &ldquo;the intellectuals are one race, the Poujadists are another.&rdquo; Poujade divides society into distinct races of people in competition with one another for survival. Barthes suggests that this division is symbolized by &ldquo;the opposition between the provinces and Paris.&rdquo; The intellectuals inhabit the city with all its vices, and the commoners live &ldquo;back home in the village.&rdquo; Barthes argues that Poujade&rsquo;s story features &ldquo;corruptions of romantic themes&rdquo; that capitalize on glamorizing innocence and promoting hatred for ideas.</p><hr><a href=#part-21--myth-is-a-type-of-speechthe-form-and-the-concept--summary><h1 id=part-21--myth-is-a-type-of-speechthe-form-and-the-concept--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 21 : Myth Is a Type of Speech–The Form and the Concept | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-21><h2 id=summary-21><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><a href=#myth-is-a-type-of-speech><h3 id=myth-is-a-type-of-speech><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Myth Is a Type of Speech&rdquo;</h3></a><p>&ldquo;Myth Today&rdquo; is the second section of 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/key-figure-analysis/#Roland_Barthes rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a>&lsquo;s <em>Mythologies</em>. Barthes answers the question &ldquo;what is myth today?&rdquo; Barthes clarifies that myth is not just &ldquo;<em>any</em> type&rdquo; of speech. He explains that myth is &ldquo;a message&rdquo; that requires &ldquo;special conditions.&rdquo; Barthes categorizes myth as a &ldquo;form.&rdquo; He remarks that everything has the capacity to become a myth. Barthes argues that &ldquo;human history&rdquo; is responsible for the transformation of objects into myths. He maintains that there are no eternal myths. Barthes views myths as tied to a specific place and time. Barthes claims that even the ancient myth surrounding &ldquo;Woman&rdquo; is not eternal. Barthes defines &ldquo;<em>language, discourse, speech,</em> etc., to mean any significant unit or synthesis, whether verbal or visual.&rdquo; Myths may be communicated through images as well as through language.</p><a href=#myth-as-a-semiological-system><h3 id=myth-as-a-semiological-system><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Myth as a Semiological System&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/author/ rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> situates mythology within the broader context of &ldquo;this vast science of signs which Saussure postulated some forty years ago under the name of <em>semiology.</em>&rdquo; Semiology is the study of signs. Barthes credits the Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure (1857–1913) with the invention of semiology. Barthes alleges that the work of semiology largely involves &ldquo;the problem of meaning&rdquo; that &ldquo;studies significations apart from their content.&rdquo; Barthes identifies two related terms in semiology. The terms are &ldquo;a <em>signifier</em> and a <em>signified</em>.&rdquo; The relationship between the signifier and signified forms a &ldquo;sign&rdquo; which is a third term involved in semiological analysis. Barthes writes that &ldquo;the signifier is empty, the sign is full, it is a meaning.&rdquo; Myth requires a &ldquo;second-order&rdquo; system &ldquo;constructed from a semiological chain which existed before it.&rdquo; Barthes calls myth a &ldquo;metalanguage&rdquo; because it transforms a sign into a new signifier and initiates a second language containing the first.</p><a href=#the-form-and-the-concept><h3 id=the-form-and-the-concept><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;The Form and the Concept&rdquo;</h3></a><p>Myth involves a signifier that is &ldquo;at the same time meaning and form, full on one side and empty on the other.&rdquo; The signifier is meaningful because it is the byproduct of a first-order relationship between a signifier and a signified. Roland Barthes notes that &ldquo;when it becomes form, the meaning leaves its contingency behind; it empties itself.&rdquo; Myths transform signs into significations through an introduction of form. The forms that are imposed by myths do not strip signs of their historical meanings. Instead the historical meanings of signs are pushed to the background in the construction of the myth. Barthes clarifies that &ldquo;the form of myth is not a symbol&rdquo; because form contains its own meaning. Barthes argues that &ldquo;this history which drains out of the form will be wholly absorbed by the concept.&rdquo; Barthes describes the concept as &ldquo;filled with a situation&rdquo; and unlike an abstract form. Concepts have an &ldquo;open character&rdquo; that can be &ldquo;appropriated&rdquo; and used in an indefinite variety of ways. Barthes alleges that &ldquo;this repetition of the concept through different forms is precious to the mythologist.&rdquo; Myths are deciphered using specific concepts that emerge in particular historical situations.</p><a href=#analysis-20><h2 id=analysis-20><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><a href=#myth-is-a-type-of-speech-1><h3 id=myth-is-a-type-of-speech-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Myth Is a Type of Speech&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/key-figure-analysis/#Roland_Barthes rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> clarifies his definition of myth. Barthes&rsquo;s central claim is that history makes myths. Myths are meaningful only when they are examined from within their particular historical context. The overarching aim of <em>Mythologies</em> is to expose the myths that inform popular culture in France. Barthes elaborates on his method of assessing the meaning of the many myths his essays unpack by referring to France&rsquo;s history and culture.</p><a href=#myth-as-a-semiological-system-1><h3 id=myth-as-a-semiological-system-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Myth as a Semiological System&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/author/ rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> defines the study of signs known as semiology as &ldquo;a science of forms.&rdquo; Barthes traces &ldquo;the necessity and the limits of such a formal science.&rdquo; He maintains that the formalism involved in semiological analysis is &ldquo;quite platonic.&rdquo; His reference is to the ancient Greek philosopher Plato (c. 428/27–348/47). Plato&rsquo;s theory of forms defined ideas as perfect forms that can only be known by the mind. Barthes argues that &ldquo;all criticism must consent to the ascesis, to the artifice of analysis.&rdquo; Barthes labels formalism an &ldquo;ascesis&rdquo; because it is a form of extreme denial that ignores the particularities in the subject of analysis. Analysis is artificial because it intentionally excludes the details regarding the content of any particular myth.</p><p>Barthes maintains that the purity of the mythical form is a necessary condition for the study of signs. Myth is a semiological system that requires a formal science for making sense of it. Barthes warns that any interpretation of myth that does not keep the form and content distinction intact is &ldquo;dangerous.&rdquo; Barthes disavows realism because it depicts forms as &ldquo;ambiguous objects, half form, and half substance.&rdquo; Barthes calls form and content &ldquo;separate categories&rdquo; that signifiers and signifieds belong to. Barthes&rsquo;s analysis of myth requires distinct signifiers and signifieds that come to be related only in a &ldquo;tridimensional&rdquo; act of signification.</p><a href=#the-form-and-the-concept-1><h3 id=the-form-and-the-concept-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;The Form and the Concept&rdquo;</h3></a><p>Roland Barthes analyzes the connection between the signifier and the signified at the level of myth. Barthes defines form as empty and &ldquo;impoverished.&rdquo; The meaning that the linguistic sign contained is drained once the sign becomes the signifier of a myth. Barthes calls the meaning of the linguistic sign its &ldquo;history&rdquo; which is temporarily deemphasized by a concept in the construction of myth. Barthes describes concepts as &ldquo;open to the whole of History.&rdquo; Barthes suggests that myth has the power to create new concepts.</p><hr><a href=#part-22--the-significationthe-bourgeoisie-as-a-joint-stock-company--summary><h1 id=part-22--the-significationthe-bourgeoisie-as-a-joint-stock-company--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span> Part 22 : The Signification–The Bourgeoisie as a Joint-Stock Company | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-22><h2 id=summary-22><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><a href=#the-signification><h3 id=the-signification><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;The Signification&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/key-figure-analysis/#Roland_Barthes rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> discusses what he calls &ldquo;the duplicity&rdquo; of the signifier. Barthes writes in &ldquo;The Signification&rdquo; that &ldquo;<em>myth hides nothing</em>: its function is to distort, not to make disappear.&rdquo; Barthes alleges that form has an &ldquo;immediate presence&rdquo; that comes &ldquo;from the nature of the mythical signifier, which is already linguistic.&rdquo; The concept appears in a contrary way. Barthes notes that the concept&rsquo;s &ldquo;elements are linked by associative relations.&rdquo; The concept &ldquo;distorts&rdquo; the signifier&rsquo;s meaning. Barthes writes that &ldquo;the meaning is always there to <em>present</em> the form; the form is always there to <em>outdistance</em> the meaning.&rdquo; Barthes argues that the examination of the myth requires that the form and meaning be separated. The mythologist can focus only on one level at a time in attempting to investigate the myth. Barthes contends that &ldquo;myth plays on the analogy between meaning and form&rdquo; to present a concept.</p><a href=#reading-and-deciphering-myth><h3 id=reading-and-deciphering-myth><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Reading and Deciphering Myth&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/author/ rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> writes that a successful myth &ldquo;transforms history into nature&rdquo; and presents a concept.

Language is abstract and open to multiple interpretations. Barthes contends that mathematical and poetic languages are not easily taken as signifiers in the formation of myths. Barthes writes that poetry &ldquo;tries to transform the sign back into meaning.&rdquo; He views poetry as attempting to get at &ldquo;the meaning of things themselves.&rdquo; Barthes sees poetry&rsquo;s aim as opposite that of myth. Barthes argues that literature accommodates myth and lends itself to the creation of written signifiers.</p><a href=#the-bourgeoisie-as-a-joint-stock-company><h3 id=the-bourgeoisie-as-a-joint-stock-company><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;The Bourgeoisie as a Joint-Stock Company&rdquo;</h3></a><p>Roland Barthes examines what he deems &ldquo;exnomination.&rdquo; He uses the term exnomination to describe the way that the &ldquo;bourgeoisie&rdquo; or middle class comes to be viewed as identical to the nation. the views of France are actually those of the bourgeoisie. The fact that the bourgeoisie is not named is proof of its dominance. Barthes writes that &ldquo;the bourgeoisie merges into the nation, even if it has, in order to do so, to exclude.&rdquo; This bolsters support for the bourgeoisie &ldquo;ideology&rdquo; or way of thinking that is represented as characteristic of the nation as a whole. Barthes writes that &ldquo;the whole of France is steeped in this anonymous ideology.&rdquo; He observes the influence of bourgeois thinking in all avenues of the culture. Barthes maintains that the degraded form of bourgeois norms appears among the lower-ranking &ldquo;petit bourgeois.&rdquo; The petit bourgeois do not recognize their lower position. They instead identify themselves as bourgeois because the bourgeois position appears to be common and natural.</p><a href=#analysis-21><h2 id=analysis-21><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><a href=#the-signification-1><h3 id=the-signification-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;The Signification&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/key-figure-analysis/#Roland_Barthes rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> employs spatial metaphors to describe the imposition of concept on form which is called &ldquo;signification.&rdquo; Barthes describes the relationship between a signifier and a signified concept as the third term in the &ldquo;triangulation&rdquo; that produces a myth. Barthes maintains that this relationship is similar to a turnstile &ldquo;which presents alternately the meaning of the signifier and its form.&rdquo; The signifier is an object clothed in language, but the signified is pure form. Barthes contends that the concept functions to &ldquo;gather&rdquo; the alternating signifier and form and use it to communicate a myth. He notes that the form has the capacity to &ldquo;outdistance&rdquo; the meaning. He uses the analogy of a car window and scenery to indicate that the form and signifier exist simultaneously without any &ldquo;contradiction, conflict, or split.&rdquo; Each can be contemplated separately, but both are essential components of the &ldquo;double system&rdquo; of myth.</p><a href=#reading-and-deciphering-myth-1><h3 id=reading-and-deciphering-myth-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Reading and Deciphering Myth&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/author/ rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> presents three different methods for reading myths. The first two methods read the signifier as either &ldquo;empty&rdquo; or &ldquo;full&rdquo; depending on whether the signifier&rsquo;s meaning is taken into consideration. The third method relies on the internal &ldquo;dynamics&rdquo; of the myth to communicate &ldquo;an inextricable whole.&rdquo; Barthes maintains that the first two methods are &ldquo;static, analytical; they destroy the myth.&rdquo; He suggests that analysis can only proceed by breaking apart the myth. It is the third method that keeps the myth intact &ldquo;as a story at once true and unreal.&rdquo; Barthes contends that myth achieves its aim when it is read in the third way as an intact whole. This allows the myth disguised as truth to pass to the reader.</p><a href=#myth-as-a-stolen-language-1><h3 id=myth-as-a-stolen-language-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Myth as a Stolen Language&rdquo;</h3></a><p>Roland Barthes advances his belief that myth &ldquo;robs language&rdquo; to &ldquo;naturalize&rdquo; concepts. Barthes examines the power of myth to rob just about any language with the exception of poetry. He views poetry as aiming to articulate the reality of &ldquo;things in themselves.&rdquo; Barthes describes poetry as myth&rsquo;s opposite and suggests that myth functions to disguise reality. He suggests that it is possible to escape myth&rsquo;s grasp by producing &ldquo;an <em>artificial myth.</em>&rdquo; An artificial myth introduces &ldquo;a third semiological chain&rdquo; or chain of signs that is grounded on the myth itself. Barthes argues that an artificial myth can transform an original myth and empty it of its original meaning. This would serve to reclaim language from myth and thereby return language to its original position.</p><a href=#the-bourgeoisie-as-a-joint-stock-company-1><h3 id=the-bourgeoisie-as-a-joint-stock-company-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;The Bourgeoisie as a Joint-Stock Company&rdquo;</h3></a><p>Roland Barthes maintains that the press presents the middle class or &ldquo;bourgeoisie&rdquo; as representative of the entire nation. He writes that &ldquo;our society is the privileged field of mythical signification.&rdquo; Barthes offers evidence to support his contention by noting that &ldquo;there are no &lsquo;bourgeois&rsquo; parties&rdquo; in French politics. Barthes sees the political invisibility of the bourgeoisie as proof that it has been subsumed by the concept of the nation. Barthes writes that &ldquo;the hemorrhage of the name <em>bourgeois</em> is effected through the idea of <em>nation</em>.&rdquo; Talk about the &ldquo;nation&rdquo; must be understood as a discussion of the bourgeoisie. Barthes alleges that the bourgeoisie employs myth to capitalize on patriotism and to increase support for its agenda.</p><hr><a href=#part-23--myth-is-depoliticized-speechnecessity-and-limits-of-mythology--summary><h1 id=part-23--myth-is-depoliticized-speechnecessity-and-limits-of-mythology--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 23 : Myth Is Depoliticized Speech–Necessity and Limits of Mythology | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-23><h2 id=summary-23><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><a href=#myth-is-depoliticized-speech><h3 id=myth-is-depoliticized-speech><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Myth Is Depoliticized Speech&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/key-figure-analysis/#Roland_Barthes rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> explains that &ldquo;myth has the task of giving a historical intention a natural justification, and making contingency appear eternal.&rdquo; Barthes views myth as always dependent on its particular historical context. The magic of myth is its capacity to make its specificity appear universal. Barthes contends that myth is the proper vehicle for the transformation of thinking. He alleges that it is through myth that the &ldquo;bourgeois&rdquo; or middle-class way of thinking became the norm in France. Barthes writes that &ldquo;bourgeois ideology is defined by the abandonment of the name <em>bourgeois</em>.&rdquo; The &ldquo;nation&rdquo; replaces &ldquo;bourgeois&rdquo; in the myths that pervade popular culture. Barthes compares this to the way that &ldquo;myth is constituted by the loss of the historical quality of things.&rdquo; Myth gives history the appearance of nature just as myth gives the bourgeoisie the appearance of France. Barthes concludes that &ldquo;the function of myth is to empty reality.&rdquo; Myth invariably clarifies historical complexities by endowing them with natural clarity. Reality is &ldquo;depoliticized&rdquo; or simplified by myth and made to seem eternal rather than circumstantial.</p><a href=#myth-on-the-left-and-myth-on-the-right><h3 id=myth-on-the-left-and-myth-on-the-right><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Myth on the Left&rdquo; and &ldquo;Myth on the Right&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/author/ rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> locates myth as on the right rather than the left. Barthes associates the politically &ldquo;left&rdquo; with revolution and a fight against the established order. He writes that &ldquo;Revolution announces itself openly as Revolution and thereby abolishes myth.&rdquo; Barthes notes that the politics of the &ldquo;left&rdquo; are typically bound up with discussions of the poor and oppressed. Barthes claims that &ldquo;the speech of the oppressed is real, like that of the woodcutter.&rdquo; Myth requires a rich meaning upon which to impose a new form. Barthes argues that revolutionary political speech is always too literal to be a good foundation for establishing myths. That is the reason that Barthes thinks myth belongs to the &ldquo;right.&rdquo; Barthes contends that &ldquo;the oppressor conserves&rdquo; the world. He describes the language of the oppressor as &ldquo;theatrical.&rdquo; Oppression requires mythology to legitimize it. Barthes maintains that bourgeois myths support social inequalities by establishing their privileged norms as those the entire nation endorses.</p><a href=#necessity-and-limits-of-mythology><h3 id=necessity-and-limits-of-mythology><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Necessity and Limits of Mythology&rdquo;</h3></a><p>The term mythologist is &ldquo;rather grand and self-assured.&rdquo; Roland Barthes acknowledges that the mythologist is engaged in the &ldquo;political act&rdquo; of demonstrating &ldquo;a false Nature.&rdquo; Barthes insists that the mythologist is an outsider. He writes that the mythologist&rsquo;s task &ldquo;always remains ambiguous, hampered by its ethical origin.&rdquo; The mythologist only writes about revolution and can live it &ldquo;only vicariously&rdquo; through those who take action. Barthes describes the mythologist as &ldquo;estranged&rdquo; from the public because the mythologist expresses unpopular and uncomfortable points of view. Barthes writes that the mythologist &ldquo;cannot see the Promised Land&rdquo; because &ldquo;tomorrow&rsquo;s positivity is entirely hidden by today&rsquo;s negativity.&rdquo; The mythologist is neither grand nor self-assured. Barthes portrays the mythologist instead as insecure and excluded.</p><a href=#analysis-22><h2 id=analysis-22><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><a href=#myth-is-depoliticized-speech-1><h3 id=myth-is-depoliticized-speech-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Myth Is Depoliticized Speech&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/key-figure-analysis/#Roland_Barthes rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> employs a broad understanding of the concept of &ldquo;politics&rdquo; to explain the &ldquo;ideological inversion which defines this society.&rdquo; The &ldquo;ideological inversion&rdquo; happens when &ldquo;bourgeoisie&rdquo; or middle-class ideas appear to represent the ideas of the entire nation. Barthes alleges that it is myth that performs this function. He cites the example of the cover of a French magazine depicting a young black soldier saluting the French flag. Barthes argues the soldier&rsquo;s salute is meant to communicate that France&rsquo;s involvement in Africa is legitimate. The magazine cover seeks not merely to inform but to persuade. The intention to persuade is not stated anywhere in the magazine. The image makes France&rsquo;s involvement in Africa appear simple and natural. It &ldquo;depoliticizes&rdquo; or strips the issue of its complex details. It is in this way that the myth so efficiently passes a patriotic message without the politics along to the magazine&rsquo;s readers.</p><a href=#myth-on-the-left-and-myth-on-the-right-1><h3 id=myth-on-the-left-and-myth-on-the-right-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Myth on the Left&rdquo; and &ldquo;Myth on the Right&rdquo;</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Mythologies/author/ rel=noopener>Roland Barthes</a> associates &ldquo;left&rdquo; with &ldquo;revolutionary.&rdquo; Barthes maintains that the language of the political left does not lend itself to myth because it is so literal. He compares it to the language of &ldquo;the woodcutter&rdquo; whose speech communicates actions and not objects. Barthes makes it clear in &ldquo;Myth on the Right&rdquo; that myth properly belongs to the &ldquo;bourgeoisie&rdquo; or middle class. The privileged bourgeoisie constructs myths as a means of maintaining dominance in society. Barthes alleges that &ldquo;myth always postulates the immobility of Nature.&rdquo; Barthes identifies the &ldquo;oppressor&rdquo; with the &ldquo;right.&rdquo; He contends that the oppressor advances myth as a means of depriving objects of their history. Barthes quotes the political philosopher Karl Marx (1818–83) who wrote in <em>The German Ideology</em> (1932) that &ldquo;ideology boils down to either an erroneous conception of history <em>or to a complete abstraction from it</em>.&rdquo; Ideology involves the spread of ideas often in a way that promotes a particular political perspective. Barthes reveals his aim of exposing politically motivated myths by demonstrating how they advance the aims of the privileged bourgeoisie.</p><a href=#necessity-and-limits-of-mythology-1><h3 id=necessity-and-limits-of-mythology-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Necessity and Limits of Mythology&rdquo;</h3></a><p>Roland Barthes communicates his personal reflections on his experience of devoting himself to mythology and the study of language. He communicates his sense of feeling excluded because his work exposes unpopular truths about social injustices. Barthes argues that mythologists are &ldquo;condemned for some time yet always to speak <em>excessively</em> about reality.&rdquo; He confesses his adherence to dialectical thinking by describing his quest for a &ldquo;synthesis between ideology and poetry.&rdquo; Dialectics is a method of using logic to resolve or &ldquo;synthesize&rdquo; a conflict between two opposing positions. Barthes describes ideology and poetry as the two &ldquo;extreme methods&rdquo; for understanding reality that must be synthesized if mythology is to advance.</p><a href=#quotes><h1 id=quotes><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Quotes</h1></a><ol><li></li></ol><p> > The wrestlers remain gods.

Barthes compares wrestling to theater because he views it as a performance. Barthes argues that wrestling&rsquo;s popularity is due to its capacity to &ldquo;transmute&rdquo; reality. Wrestling presents a predictable performance of violent and comedic exchanges between easily recognizable character types. The &ldquo;bastard&rdquo; and the &ldquo;hero&rdquo; fight in a scripted manner to reveal the deepest human experiences of victory and suffering.

Barthes notices that advertisers target middle-class audiences with campaigns that promise to sell them detergents reflective of their elevated social status. Liquid chemicals are seen as appropriate only for peasants. New and improved powder detergents produce ample foam to protect middle-class housewives from harsh chemicals.

He shares his surprise at the list in the story of the number of novels each woman has published alongside the number of children each has. He contends that this serves to reinforce the view that women are primarily mothers and that their careers should not be prioritized. Barthes sees the story as insinuating that writing novels seems like merely an acceptable hobby for women who are busy being mothers. He argues that the story veils the sexist view that women are not men&rsquo;s equals and that women&rsquo;s value in society is tied to motherhood.</p><ol start=4><li></li></ol><p> >Contemporary toys are made of unpromising materials.

Through toys children come to accept the most unacceptable of adult realities including separation and war.

The French politician Pierre Poujade (1920–2003) calls common sense &ldquo;the narrowest&rdquo; reality because it is based solely on quantitative considerations. Common sense insists on equations such as &ldquo;an eye for an eye&rdquo; and &ldquo;penny for penny.&rdquo; Barthes contends that the lower-middle classes of people value equality above all else. They are rendered blind to qualitative considerations that reflect a more diversified and complex reality. An insistence on common sense is the psychological equivalent of wishing to always remain in a comfort zone. Common sense emerges from out of a fear of encounters that could challenge long-standing assumptions about the world.</p><ol start=7><li></li></ol><p> > Legal psychiatry hands over to the executioner the madmen.

He shows that each Tour has an initiation, an ordeal, a journey, a competition, and a cast of characters that pleases the worldwide audience. The audience encounters the cast from the tent where the competitors insult and challenge each other before the race begins.

Middle-class logic lacks the complexity needed to assess labor disputes in light of the total political situation.

It contains a series of essays compiled during the time that Barthes was writing for the French literary magazine <em>Les Lettres Nouvelles</em> (1953–57). <em>Mythologies</em> investigates trends in fashion, advertising, and entertainment and introduces a method of incorporating the everyday world into academic discourse.</p><a href=#early-life-and-career><h4 id=early-life-and-career><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Early Life and Career</h4></a><p>Barthes was born on November 12, 1915, in Cherbourg, France. His father Louis Barthes (d. 1916) was a naval officer who died in battle when Roland Barthes was an infant. After his father&rsquo;s death, Barthes and his mother Henriette Barthes moved to Bayonne where his grandmother and aunt lived. The two stayed there until Barthes was nine years old. They then moved to France and Barthes attended the Lycée Montaigne. Barthes went on to advance his studies at the University of Paris and earned a degree in classics in 1939 and philology or the study of literary language in 1943.</p><p>Barthes published his first book <em>Writing Degree Zero</em> in 1953. It contains a critique of language and the structures that govern proper linguistic practices. His subsequent books likewise involve critical analyses of linguistic trends, their meaning, and their social and cultural significance. His later years were marked by a critique of the enterprise of semiotics, structuralism, and linguistics. <em>Criticism and Truth</em> (1966) alleges a failure of scholars of literary studies to understand the nuances of the broader theories that they frequently discuss. Barthes challenged the traditional view that the meaning of any text is stable and fixed by its author. He published the essay &ldquo;The Death of the Author&rdquo; (1968) and announced the need for a new way of approaching literary texts. He proposed a method of &ldquo;writerly&rdquo; reading that involves the audience directly in constructing a meaningful literary work.</p><a href=#death-and-legacy><h4 id=death-and-legacy><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Death and Legacy</h4></a><p>Barthes is considered an important figure in the history of semiotics, and his work is associated with the movement in linguistics that came to be known as &ldquo;structuralism.&rdquo; Structuralism emphasizes the social and cultural context within which language emerges. Barthes later encouraged considerations beyond those that linguistic and cultural structures could reveal. He is also associated with the movement that followed structuralism known as &ldquo;post-structuralism.&rdquo; Post-structuralists deemphasized the external structures that influenced linguistic expression. They focused instead on the way that internal relationships in language shape its meaning.</p><p>Barthes&rsquo;s unique style of discursive and conversational writing earned him an equal number of fans and critics. Barthes&rsquo;s theories about semiotics influenced scholars in Europe as well as in Japan and America where he traveled to deliver lectures in the late 1960s. Barthes died on March 25, 1980, after a truck struck and fatally injured him while he was out walking in Paris, France. Posthumous publications of his writings by his friend the American author Susan Sontag (1933–2004) reveal more of the previously unknown details of his personal life.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://potatomat0.github.io/obsidian-public-vault/js/graph.6579af7b10c818dbd2ca038702db0224.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Nhat Hoang © 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://potatomat0.github.io/obsidian-public-vault/>Home</a></li><li><a href=http://nhatkothieunang.web.app/>Other hobby links</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/potatomat0/obsidian-public-vault>GitHub</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
