Only the first volume was finished in Marx&rsquo;s lifetime; the second two volumes were compiled from Marx&rsquo;s notes by German philosopher Friedrich Engels. Marx stated his purpose in writing the work was to &ldquo;lay bare the economic law of motion of modern society.&rdquo; He was not referring to the law of motion in the sense of physical properties; rather, his purpose was to elaborate on the relationship between economics and human social behavior.</p><a href=#about-the-title><h3 id=about-the-title><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>About the Title</h3></a><p>&ldquo;Das Kapital&rdquo; is German for <em>capital</em>, meaning wealth or assets. It is the same <em>capital</em> that is the root of the term <em>capitalism</em>, the focus of Marx&rsquo;s text. For Marx&rsquo;s purposes, capitalism also implies the social relationship between the wage laborer and the owner of capital. The subtitle of the work, &ldquo;A Critique of Political Economy,&rdquo; indicates that the text is a critique (detailed evaluation) of the intellectual discipline of political economy, which in Marx&rsquo;s view has failed to account for the actual operations of capitalism.</p><a href=#main-ideas><h1 id=main-ideas><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Main ideas</h1></a><a href=#the-commodity><h2 id=the-commodity><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Commodity</h2></a><p>A commodity is, in Marx&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;an external object, a thing which through its qualities satisfies human needs.&rdquo; Commodities can take many forms but must have some sort of use-value to humans. In a simple economic exchange, one commodity is exchanged for another of equal value. Commodities may have two types of value—exchange-value and use-value. A commodity has no use-value for the person exchanging it, but it does have exchange-value to them. Conversely, that same commodity does have use-value for the person receiving it (otherwise there would be no reason for bartering for it).</p><p>The value of a commodity is equal to the value of the labor used to produce that commodity. In the capitalist system labor itself is a commodity. The capitalist purchases the labor of a worker for a certain duration of time, and the laborer in turn produces a commodity. The commodity produced has no use-value for the capitalist, who is interested only in selling it. Therefore, the capitalist is mainly concerned with the exchange-value of what his workers produce.</p><p>Marx begins his analysis of capitalism with commodities. This is because the commodity is the most fundamental form of wealth in capitalism. It is only by beginning with an examination of this elemental unit that Marx felt he could unfold his exploration of the capitalist mode of production.</p><p>Marx felt that the true source of value—labor power—was hidden in the production of commodities. This led people to believe that commodities themselves, especially money, created value. Marx called this commodity fetishism.</p><a href=#surplus-value><h2 id=surplus-value><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Surplus-Value</h2></a><p>While commodities themselves have a use-value and exchange-value, the capitalist is interested primarily in the creation of surplus-value. A surplus is created when commodities have a value greater than that necessary to sustain human needs. A surplus creates profit. Profit is then injected back into the production of commodities to create ever-greater surpluses.</p><p>A surplus might lead to more human needs being filled than before. This is beside the point to capital, which is only ever concerned with the creation of greater profits and, thus, more capital.</p><p>For Marx, it was these laws of the capitalist system that produced its greatest iniquities. Capital is blind to human need. It is also blind to human suffering. The horrors of industrialization occurred not primarily because of the inhumanity of bosses but because of the amoral logic of the profit motive. For Marx, the solution lay only in the overthrow of the capitalist mode of production and its replacement with a mode of production directed by the fulfillment of human needs: socialism.</p><a href=#capital><h2 id=capital><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Capital</h2></a><p>Capital is the fundamental instrument of capitalist production. Money is produced by the sale of commodities and is used to purchase commodities. In turn, these commodities are sold at a profit. For Marx, &ldquo;the circulation of money as capital is an end in itself, for the valorization of value takes place only within this constantly renewed movement. The movement of capital is therefore limitless.&rdquo;</p><p>The purpose of capital is to create more capital in the process called capital accumulation. Commodities are only worthwhile to capital insofar as their sale generates a profit. An even purer form of this profit generation exists when loans are made at interest or invested for profit in the stock market.</p><a href=#modes-of-production><h2 id=modes-of-production><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Modes of Production</h2></a><p>The mode of production is the prevailing structure of production in (and of) a society. A mode of production is a combination of means of production and relations of production. Means of production include inputs like technologies, tools, raw materials, and available labor. Relations of production are the factors that determine the position of people in the process of production. Capitalists own factories, tools, and raw materials, and pay laborers while taking the lion&rsquo;s share of profits for themselves.</p><p>Thus, a mode of production is both an economic and a social system. The prevailing mode of production defines the shape of a society. Marx is careful to point out that a mode of production is not a set fact, nor a product of &ldquo;human nature.&rdquo; It is historically contingent. Marx identified capitalism as the latest of several historical modes of production. The capitalist mode had replaced the feudal mode. In the feudal mode, production occurred mostly on the land through farming. The owners of this land, aristocrats, demanded labor and loyalty from the masses of peasants. In return, peasants were (mostly) permitted enough food to survive, and (mostly) granted the protection of their lord. Although Marx&rsquo;s account of feudalism is abstract, it serves to explain how the shape of production and the shape of society informed one another.</p><a href=#class-and-class-struggle><h2 id=class-and-class-struggle><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Class and Class Struggle</h2></a><p>The prevailing mode of production gives rise to social classes within society. A class is a group of people united by their position relative to the process of production. A class has shared interests and behaviors.</p><p>In capitalism, the primary classes are owners, called the bourgeoisie, and workers, called the proletariat. The bourgeoisie is defined by its ownership of the means of production and its ability to purchase the labor power of workers. The working class is defined by its lack of control over means of production. To survive, the working class must sell its labor to the bourgeoisie.</p><p>The primary relation between the classes is conflict. The interests of the classes are fundamentally and intractably opposed. The bourgeoisie wants more labor from workers and more profit from production. Left to its own devices the bourgeoisie would demand the maximum labor time from workers in exchange for as little pay as possible. On the other hand, workers wish to work less for more pay. Ideally, workers would have a say in the direction of production.</p><p>For Marx, class struggle is the primary engine of history. The power of one class in relation to the other defines the shape of society and the form of production. Marx predicted, ultimately, that capitalism would destroy itself. It would do this by intensifying the contradictions within the system sufficiently that the working class would triumph in the class struggle and overthrow capitalism altogether. Only then could the great productive capacity and technical genius of industrial society be made to truly serve human needs.</p><a href=#context><h1 id=context><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Context</h1></a><a href=#capitalism-and-the-industrial-revolution><h2 id=capitalism-and-the-industrial-revolution><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Capitalism and the Industrial Revolution</h2></a><p><em>Capital</em> is primarily concerned with the new industrial society of the 19th century and the new &ldquo;mode of production&rdquo; that drove it: capitalism. Beginning in Britain in the late 18th century, industrialization began to take hold in a revolution that would transform politics, economics, and society and give birth to the modern world as it is known today.</p><p>The industrial revolution brought many changes. New fuel sources, like coal-powered steam engines, allowed the creation of new transportation methods as well as powering larger machines for use in factories. Factories themselves grew as a result of new theories about the division of labor and the intensified productive activity permitted by new technologies. Some of these technologies, like the spinning jenny (spinning frame with multiple spindles), increased the efficiency and productivity of the production of basic goods by orders of magnitude. Mass production began to lead to the creation of a mass consumer society.</p><p>All of this was powered not only by technological innovation but also by a revolution in political economy—the rise of capitalism. The industrial capitalist began to replace the landed lord as the primary agent of economic activity, as liberal ideology began to take hold, promoting free trade, free enterprise, and private property. Marx saw capitalism as a transformation in all of society, because capitalism aimed to transform social relations. Where ties to land, family, and lord had dominated people&rsquo;s experience of the world, in capitalism these relations were to be eroded until all that mattered was the relation between the worker, who needed to sell labor to live, and the employer, who sought his own economic advantage as the highest virtue.</p><p>Marx and other radicals, like his patron and collaborator Friedrich Engels (1820–95), saw that the growth of industrial capitalism was creating a new class of people—the industrial working class. Marx and his collaborators saw in the suffering of this new class of people the dark side of capitalist modernity. Engels, a factory owner, conducted a study of workers in Manchester, England, and published it as <em>The Condition of the Working Class in England</em> in 1845. What Engels found was that the new industrial working classes were living lives of misery and deprivation compared to those their ancestors had experienced. Engels found that disease was widespread, industrial accidents were common, and infant mortality was on the rise. For all the unheard-of wonders and great wealth for a few that industrial capitalism created, it seemed to observers like Marx and Engels that it could only do so by breaking the backs of great masses of human beings.</p><a href=#marx-and-the-working-class-movement><h2 id=marx-and-the-working-class-movement><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Marx and the Working-Class Movement</h2></a><p>Marx was concerned not only with material deprivation but also with the diminished sense of self-worth suffered by workers. Unlike in a feudal mode of production, where laborers own some of the crops that they produce, Marx saw that in capitalism laborers have no ownership over the things they make or the tools they use. He identified this phenomenon of alienated labor with a loss of dignity and self-worth.</p><p>He was an active participant in revolutionary movements throughout his career. These commitments led to his joining the Communist League and eventually to a role in creating the International Working Men&rsquo;s Association, or the First International. Marx saw himself not only as an organizer and radical, however, but also as a philosopher, a student of history, and a writer. Marx thought that political writing should not be confined only to polemics and easily digested calls to action (although he was more than willing to write those, in his newspapers and in his famous pamphlets like &ldquo;The Communist Manifesto&rdquo;). Central to Marx&rsquo;s project, however, was the idea that capitalism had to be understood and exposed before it could be overthrown. Furthermore, Marx wanted to make a lasting statement of his own political principles and to prove their validity, in the face of criticism from the followers of other radicals, such as Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809–65), Louis Auguste Blanqui (1805–81), and Bakunin (1814–76). This led him to devote as much energy as he was able to his great work, <em>Capital</em>.</p><p>Throughout, <em>Capital</em> is concerned with the ways in which capitalism harms the industrial working class that it had created. In <em>Capital</em> Marx shows that the capitalist system works, ultimately, to enrich a few at the detriment of all others. He also demonstrated that workers are cut off from political representation as well as economic fortunes because capitalists concentrate power as well as wealth.</p><p><em>Capital</em> does have a hopeful note for the working class. Marx believed he had identified contradictions within capitalism that would inevitably lead to its destruction and the liberation of the industrial proletariat through communism. The writer was less sure, however, about when and how this would happen.</p><p>Marx tried to divide his time between practical action and serious study because he thought both were vital to the success of the working-class movement. He memorably summarized his attitude about the necessary union of practical and intellectual action in his &ldquo;Theses on Feuerbach&rdquo; (1845): &ldquo;Philosophers have hitherto only <em>interpreted</em> the world in various ways; the point is to <em>change</em> it.&rdquo;</p><a href=#_capital_-an-unfinished-text><h2 id=_capital_-an-unfinished-text><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span><em>Capital</em>: An Unfinished Text</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Capital-Das-Kapital/author/ rel=noopener>Karl Marx</a> died in 1883. Only Volume 1 of <em>Capital</em> was published in Marx&rsquo;s lifetime. Volumes 2 and 3 were compiled, edited, and published in 1885 and 1894, respectively, by Friedrich Engels after Marx&rsquo;s death. <em>Capital</em> should thus be considered an unfinished text. Although Marx had produced sufficient material for Volumes 2 and 3 for Engels to organize and publish them, this material had not been assembled to Marx&rsquo;s satisfaction in his lifetime. One of the reasons for the unfinished state of Marx&rsquo;s work is that Marx continually revised, drafted, and re-drafted his work as he continued to think and research. It is not known what Marx&rsquo;s own final editions would have looked like, had he lived. Engels, himself an accomplished writer and philosopher, published these volumes as a tribute to his friend&rsquo;s work and out of a sense of duty to Marx&rsquo;s ideas and to the cause—communist revolution—in which they both believed.</p><p>Because <em>Capital</em> was unfinished in Marx&rsquo;s lifetime and because of the importance of Marx&rsquo;s ideas to communist movements and governments in the 20th century, later thinkers continued to search Marx&rsquo;s notes for his insights into history, economics, and political economy. For this reason Marx&rsquo;s <em>Grundrisse</em> (<em>Outlines</em>), which had been completed by 1857, was published in 1941. The <em>Grundrisse</em> is an 800-page manuscript of notes concerning Marx&rsquo;s inquiries into capital, wage labor, history, and economics. Many of the ideas outlined in the <em>Grundrisse</em> were refined by Marx in his later work.</p><a href=#_capital_today><h2 id=_capital_today><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span><em>Capital</em> Today</h2></a><p><em>Capital</em> became a highly influential text for revolutionaries from its publication through the 20th century. After the success of communist revolutions in Russia, China, and elsewhere, <em>Capital</em> became a central text in the official ideology of Marxist regimes. In capitalist countries it failed to gain much traction outside academic and radical circles, however. As the brutality of communist regimes became apparent, and especially after the stagnation and downfall of the Soviet Union, <em>Capital</em> fell further out of fashion. Marx&rsquo;s magnum opus has received a surge in new interest, however, in the years following the financial crisis and recession of 2008. Emboldened by the apparent failure of mainstream economics and policymakers, more economists, politicians, students, and ordinary people have shown an interest in Marx&rsquo;s ideas and the analysis of capitalist political economy they offer.</p><a href=#brief-summary><h1 id=brief-summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Brief Summary</h1></a><a href=#part-1><h2 id=part-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 1</h2></a><p>Part 1 is probably the most intensive section of <em>Capital</em>. It lays out the groundwork for 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Capital-Das-Kapital/author/ rel=noopener>Marx</a>&rsquo;s definition of capitalism and some of its main problems that he addresses in later sections. In Part 1 Marx introduces the concepts of the commodity, different value types, and money. According to Marx, the main types of value of a commodity are use-value and exchange-value. Another type of value, surplus-value, is what capitalists hope to generate in order to grow their manufacturing and create a profit. Marx uses his somewhat notorious example of the equivalent value of coats to linen to illustrate various aspects of value, exchange, and barter. He also introduces the concept of the fetishization of commodities, wherein the nature of the relationship between producers and purchasers is misinterpreted as a relationship between commodities. This idea plays a role in Marx&rsquo;s development of his theories around surplus-value and profit.</p><a href=#part-2><h2 id=part-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 2</h2></a><p>Marx introduces the topic of capital by name and begins to outline its basic elements. The basic formula for exchanging goods for money for goods, C-M-C (commodity-money-commodity), becomes M-C-M in the capitalist system. The prime symbol following M-C-M indicates that the capitalist has more money, in the form of commodities, at the end of the process than at the beginning. Marx poses the question of where the surplus-value comes from, if a commodity is purchased at market price and the product made with that commodity also sells at market price. His answer is that the surplus-value is created in the form of labor-power. The laborers sell their labor, so that labor becomes their commodity, and the capitalist purchases the labor for a certain duration. Labor-power is the only commodity that can produce more than its own value. This is what makes it possible for a capitalist to pay a &ldquo;fair&rdquo; wage and still get &ldquo;extra&rdquo; or surplus labor power out of a worker.</p><a href=#part-3><h3 id=part-3><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 3</h3></a><p>In Part 3 of <em>Capital</em> Marx digs deeper into the mechanics of the capitalist system. He defines the concept of labor and reiterates that the capitalist buys a worker&rsquo;s labor for a certain length of time. The worker&rsquo;s labor-power is consumed in the production process itself. The &ldquo;product&rdquo; that comes out is the commodity that the capitalist then distributes or sells. At this point, surplus value in the commodity becomes profit in money form. While in more traditional and simple systems of barter and trade the use-value of an item is extremely important, this is not the case in the capitalist system. Capitalists are primarily concerned with the exchange-value of a commodity, and this is what they base decisions on.</p><p>Chapters 8 and 9 of Part 3 deal with the concept of constant vs. variable capital. Constant capital includes the production means and energy transferred to the product, while variable capital is the labor-power. Chapter 9 gives an equation for determining total capital: <em>C</em> = (<em>c</em> + <em>v</em>) + <em>s</em>. In this equation <em>C</em> is the capital, <em>c</em> represents constant capital, <em>v</em> is variable capital, and <em>s</em> equals the surplus-value. Finally, Marx delineates how the length of the working day is used to create surplus-value. The workers are paid the amount necessary for basic sustenance, but work many hours longer than they would if they were simply selling or trading the product of their labor. For instance, if a laborer needed to work 6 hours to create enough of a product to make a living, they make that same amount under the capitalist but work for 12 hours.</p><a href=#part-4><h2 id=part-4><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 4</h2></a><p>In Part 4 Marx continues to explore the concepts of surplus-value and labor. Surplus-value can be organized into relative and absolute surplus-value. Absolute surplus-value is created by lengthening the overall working day, whereas relative surplus-value is created by shortening the amount of necessary labor-time. This second type of surplus-value is created by speeding up the production of the worker, usually through machinery and a division of labor. Machinery does not lessen the work of the laborers but instead forces them to work more. Division of labor helps streamline a process of manufacture because each worker is responsible only for a small part of the overall manufacturing process. However, it also takes skilled workers and turns them into machines who do the same process over and over.</p><a href=#part-5><h2 id=part-5><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 5</h2></a><p>Marx continues in his discussion of surplus-value. Capitalism continually seeks to maximize its surplus-value, meaning it milks the most out of its workers for the least amount of wage. According to Marx, the capitalist is always seeking to either lengthen the working day or increase worker efficiency. In the capitalist system the measure of productivity is not based on the commodity produced, but the amount of surplus-value produced. Marx concludes the section with a chapter that presents various formulae used for the computation of surplus-value.</p><a href=#part-6><h2 id=part-6><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 6</h2></a><p>Part 6 deals primarily with the topic of wages. Ultimately, Marx argues, there are two ways a worker may be paid for work in the capitalist system. One way is called the time-wage, where the worker is paid a set amount to work a certain length of time—that is, they are paid by the day or the week. When workers are paid by the piece or the completion of a project, this is called a piece-wage. However, for the piece-wage system to work, the capitalist still calculates the amount of time it should take to complete a piece. This becomes problematic because a worker will often be fired if they cannot complete a piece with maximum efficiency in the average amount of time. Marx uses examples from Europe and England to illustrate the condition of wages at the time.</p><a href=#part-7><h2 id=part-7><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 7</h2></a><p>In the two chapters of Part 7 Marx proposes that capitalist production is actually a system of reproduction, because the nature of capitalism is cyclical. In fact, surplus-value only becomes capital if some portion of it is reinvested in the process. This constant reinvestment causes capital to grow and accumulate and creates demand for more and more workers. The nature of capitalism is to create the working class that it then exploits.</p><a href=#part-8><h2 id=part-8><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 8</h2></a><p>Part 8 provides a historical background for the origin and rise of capitalism, primarily in England, between the 15th and 19th centuries. Marx details expropriation of members of the peasant class from their lands and the resulting poverty and vagrancy that many sank into. The monarchs of the 15th and 16th centuries passed laws that brutally punished vagrancy and thus prepared a whole class of workers who were beaten down and ready to accept the low wages and poor working conditions of industrial and agrarian capitalism in the 18th and 19th centuries.</p><hr><a href=#vol-1-part-1-chapter-1--commodities-and-money-the-commodity--summary><h1 id=vol-1-part-1-chapter-1--commodities-and-money-the-commodity--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Vol. 1, Part 1, Chapter 1 : Commodities and Money (The Commodity) | Summary</h1></a><p>Although Marx envisioned a multivolume <em>Capital</em>, he finished only Volume 1 before his death; Volumes 2 and 3 were completed from his notes by his long-time friend Friedrich Engels.

Even it, due to its length, is often not studied in its entirety.</p><p>Volume 1 comprises 8 named parts, each of which has named chapters. For the purposes of this guide, the more commonly studied parts (Parts 1, 2, and 3) are summarized and analyzed in depth at the chapter level. Each of the remaining five parts (Parts 4–8) is summarized in its entirety.</p><a href=#summary><h2 id=summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p>The title of Volume 1, <em>Capitalist Production</em>, indicates 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Capital-Das-Kapital/author/ rel=noopener>Marx</a>&rsquo;s focus on examining the constituent parts of capitalist production, explaining how they work together, and then exposing the exploitation inherent in such an economy.</p><p>Marx begins Chapter 1 by defining and analyzing the concept of the commodity. He describes it as &ldquo;an external object, a thing which through its qualities satisfies human needs of whatever kind.&rdquo; There are three main ways to measure the value of a commodity, and they are interlinked: use-value, exchange-value, and value. The use-value of a commodity is determined by the usefulness of the commodity as it satisfies a human need. Marx explains exchange-value by saying there is always a certain amount of something that can be exchanged for a certain amount of something else. He gives the example of corn and iron, explaining that a certain amount of corn can be exchanged for a certain amount of iron. Unlike use-value, which is based in the properties of the commodity, exchange-value is created by people. Marx outlines their differences in the statement, &ldquo;As use-values, commodities differ above all in quality, while as exchange-values they can only differ in quantity.&rdquo; Despite their differences the use-value and exchange-value are inherently connected. In order to create an article that has value, a certain amount of labor is necessary. The average amount of time required to produce a commodity is called &ldquo;socially necessary labor-time.&rdquo; Labor, according to Marx, is the &ldquo;the substance of value.&rdquo;</p><p>In Section 2 Marx further elaborates on the concept of labor with regard to value. He uses the analogy of the value of a coat versus the value of 20 yards of linen. While it could be said that the coat&rsquo;s value is equivalent to the 20 yards of linen, different labor processes go into the creation of each. In the end, however, if one person has a need for a coat and another for linen, these items become equivalent in value and can be traded. Marx details the idea behind the exchange-value of the coat and the linen: he explains that because the coat requires extra labor of tailoring, &ldquo;the linen contains only half as much labor as the coat.&rdquo; Thus, the linen requires more units to match the worth of the coat.</p><p>Commodities are &ldquo;at the same time objects of utility and bearers of value,&rdquo; according to Marx. He proposes to get to the heart of the concept of money, explaining that money is something that has value because it can be exchanged for commodities but is abstract and not a commodity in itself. In condensed terms, Marx says, the &ldquo;simplest value-relation is &mldr; that of one commodity to another commodity of a different kind.&rdquo; Marx then goes on to do a series of exercises in which the value of the items from his earlier example—the linen and the coat—fluctuate as a result of changes in labor-time required to produce one or the other item, illustrating how labor can affect the worth of a commodity. Marx designates two types of labor: concrete labor and abstract labor. Abstract human labor is represented in the &ldquo;body of the commodity.&rdquo; The concrete labor that is required to give a commodity use-value becomes abstract labor in the sense of the exchange-value. The money form eventually becomes an expression of value when a widespread exchange of commodities begins to take place within a society. It becomes the &ldquo;universal equivalent form.&rdquo;</p><p>The character of a commodity is more complex than just its use-value. It becomes something imbued with social labor. Marx explains that commodities are the physical form of types of human labor. There are three ways that labor creates value: 1) different kinds of human labor are equalized, giving common value to the commodities; 2) the &ldquo;magnitude of the value&rdquo; of the commodity can be measured by the duration and labor involved in its creation, and 3) the social aspect of the labor (i.e., the &ldquo;relationships between the producers&rdquo;) determines the social context of the commodity. In this way commodities are &ldquo;fetishized,&rdquo; because they are given extra meaning by social labor, or their exchange-value. This fetishism becomes a social problem, Marx claims, when people begin to equate commodities with their prices and don&rsquo;t have any comprehension of the labor that went into producing them. Finally, Marx points out what he sees as a critical capitalist economic mistake: confusing the exchange-value of an item with some property inherent in the item itself.</p><a href=#analysis><h2 id=analysis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Capital-Das-Kapital/author/ rel=noopener>Marx</a> defines the concept of &ldquo;commodity&rdquo; in the broadest sense. Most readers are likely to think of a commodity in the abstract, speculative sense of the term that predominates today—for example, grain or oil traded on a commodities market. However, Marx has in mind something far more expansive. The &ldquo;thing &mldr; that satisfies human needs&rdquo; can be as tangible as food that satisfies hunger or as abstract as a book that satisfies a reader&rsquo;s need for knowledge.</p><p>To understand the concept of a commodity&rsquo;s use-value, readers must note Marx&rsquo;s qualification that the use-value &ldquo;of a commodity is independent of the amount of labor required to appropriate its useful qualities.&rdquo; In other words, when speaking about use-value, only the actual physical properties of the commodity itself are being taken into account, and all other things of value surrounding actually making that object useful (i.e., planting, growing, shucking, and processing a corn plant in order to get corn) are not included in the use-value. The actions in the process of making a commodity actually useful are referred to as &ldquo;labor,&rdquo; and labor is quantified as simply &ldquo;value,&rdquo; and not as &ldquo;use-value&rdquo; or &ldquo;exchange-value.&rdquo;</p><p>In the end of Section 2 Marx follows some logical steps to a few notable conclusions. One important moment to note is when Marx claims that &ldquo;all commodities, when taken in certain proportions, must be equal in value.&rdquo; He rationalizes that the real measure of value is in the amount of labor needed to produce a commodity, and that as a result commodities don&rsquo;t have any unique value outside of the labor needed to produce them. For example, if it takes a hundred hours of labor to create one thing, and a single hour to produce a second thing, then a hundred units of the second thing will have the same value as a one unit of the first. This is because the labor will then be equivalent in value.</p><p>Value, it is important to note, is something that is best &ldquo;expressed relatively&rdquo; in Marx&rsquo;s opinion. By this, he means that the value of one commodity can be best understood in relation to another commodity—that is, a commodity cannot be traded for itself but must be exchanged for different but equivalent value goods. A commodity might have an inherent use-value, but its full value can&rsquo;t be quantified without placing it in relation to other different commodities.</p><p>Marx uses the relationship between labor and value to present an interesting solution to a philosophical problem brought up by the classical Greek philosopher Aristotle. He lays out Aristotle&rsquo;s issue with value: that it is actually impossible to take two completely different things and call them &ldquo;qualitatively equal.&rdquo; Thus Aristotle comes to the conclusion that value doesn&rsquo;t really exist and that coming up with an equation to equate the value of two disparate things is only &ldquo;a makeshift for practical purposes.&rdquo; Marx&rsquo;s theory of labor as a way to measure and interpret value, though, solves this problem. Marx proposes that Aristotle could not have come to this conclusion because ancient Greek society used slave labor, and therefore there was inherent inequality in the types of labor. No average human labor could be quantified as a result.</p><p>Ultimately, the &ldquo;fetishism&rdquo; or exchange-value applied to commodities creates a situation where people can simply look at an item and internalize its value—for instance, the way one might look at a price tag—but not any of the processes involved in the creation of that value. For example, in a society that exchanges money for commodities, a person can look at a price tag and understand the value of the item only in the simplest of terms—how much money must be exchanged for the item. But the person doesn&rsquo;t necessarily understand the complex nature of the value of that item: they don&rsquo;t see the different types and amounts of labor that went into making it, only the amount of money they have to pay in exchange for it.</p><hr><a href=#vol-1-part-1-chapters-23--commodities-and-money--summary><h1 id=vol-1-part-1-chapters-23--commodities-and-money--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span> Vol. 1, Part 1, Chapters 2–3 : Commodities and Money | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-1><h2 id=summary-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><a href=#chapter-2-the-process-of-exchange><h3 id=chapter-2-the-process-of-exchange><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 2: The Process of Exchange</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Capital-Das-Kapital/author/ rel=noopener>Marx</a> opens Chapter 2 with a reminder that commodities are just items and cannot take themselves to market. They need human beings to place them in relation with one another and take guardianship of them. This act of recognizing the &ldquo;guardianship&rdquo; of another person over commodities is how Marx introduces the concept of private property. To its owner, Marx goes on to explain, a commodity has no use-value, but only an exchange-value. The owner is putting his commodity on the market because he doesn&rsquo;t need it, but he does have a need for another commodity, and thus makes the exchange.</p><p>The movement of a society toward more commercial interaction creates a need for money, which Marx claims represents an &ldquo;independent form of value.&rdquo; This creates a different system: instead of commodities exchanged for other commodities, money is being exchanged for commodities. This moves away from a system of simple exchange of items, because a second element is being introduced: the money-form. Marx explains that money can actually take many forms, because as the universal &ldquo;Value-Form&rdquo; it is simply whatever type of item a given society chooses to use (cattle, gold, fruit, etc.). This commodity then takes on two values: its original use-value as a commodity (Marx gives the example of gold being used to fill teeth or produce luxury items) and its universal use-value, which arises from a &ldquo;specific social function.&rdquo;</p><a href=#chapter-3-money-or-the-circulation-of-commodities><h3 id=chapter-3-money-or-the-circulation-of-commodities><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 3: Money, or the Circulation of Commodities</h3></a><p>Marx proposes to use gold as the standard example for money in the following chapter for the sake of simplicity. In this first section of Chapter 3 Marx explains that money can only measure value in an imaginary sense. As briefly touched upon at the end of Chapter 2, money has no inherent value outside of its use-value: it is given an imaginary value by society in order to barter it for actual commodities. Money also has two different functions. First, it functions as a measure of value, as it works as a representation of human labor within a society. Second, it functions as a standard of price as &ldquo;a quantity of metal with a fixed weight.&rdquo;</p><p>Marx proposes that gold, as a standard of money, has a value that is relative to itself. The value of the metal itself may go up or down, but 12 ounces of gold is still worth 12 times as much as one ounce. Thus, once a standard of money is set, though the material might fluctuate in value, its worth in the market stays constant. Marx elaborates on the relationship between commodities, money, and value, explaining that the value of a commodity rises &ldquo;when the value of money remains constant,&rdquo; while money falls in value &ldquo;when the values of commodities remain constant.&rdquo; Marx makes a further distinction between price and value. While value has previously been thoroughly discussed and defined, the author now proposes that price refers simply to the quantity of gold needed to exchange for a commodity and is therefore a manifestation of the labor-value of gold.</p><p>Marx proposes to create a space in which can co-exist the previous contradictions that arose from the defining of commodity-value. The process of commodities moving from someone to whom they have no use-value to a person for whom they do have use-value he calls <em>social metabolism</em>. When the concept of money enters the scene, Marx illustrates the full exchange produced as C-M-C, or &ldquo;commodity-money-commodity.&rdquo; In this process a person exchanges for money a commodity with no use-value to them. They then exchange the money for a commodity that does have use-value to them. This is called the &ldquo;metamorphosis of commodities.&rdquo;</p><p>This movement of commodity to money back to commodity, and so on, is a circuit. It forms the basis for the circulation of money. When a commodity is purchased and money moves from the buyer to seller, that commodity is taken out of circulation and becomes an object of consumption. Money, however, always can be considered in circulation. Marx explains that with the fluctuation in the prices of commodities, &ldquo;it follows that the quantity of money in circulation must fall or rise to the same extent.&rdquo; He vehemently strikes down the idea that the prices of commodities are set by how much commodity is in circulation, and that the quantity of commodities in circulation is determined by the amount of money a country has. Instead, he argues that how much of a commodity is in circulation depends on the total of the &ldquo;prices of the commodities in circulation, and the average velocity of the circulation of money.&rdquo;</p><p>Marx explains how the coin functions as the main form of money and is different from gold bullion only in physical shape. Gold is used as a universal currency, and its relationship to the commodity is measured in the form of its weight. Paper money, becoming a step more abstract, simply represents the gold that exists. It is a symbol of money and of value. The paper itself is worthless, and its circulation and worth in relation to gold are established by the state.</p><p>Section 3 continues to expound on the concept of money. Marx explains that sometimes money can become the object of desire itself, and instead of being exchanged for commodities it is hoarded, thus breaking the C-M-C cycle. Wealth can itself become a form of power, because if someone has hoarded money, they do not need to sell a commodity in order to purchase one. Marx claims that for the hoarder, &ldquo;to sell much and buy little is the sum of his political economy.&rdquo;</p><p>Marx also explains the foundations of the concept of simple credit. Sometimes commodities are bound to seasons or other external factors that cause them to be available only at certain times. In this situation Marx says that &ldquo;one commodity-owner may therefore step forth as a seller before the other is ready to buy.&rdquo; This creates a situation in which something might be bought on credit, before the buyer has sold his own commodity and obtained the money to purchase. The introduction of credit and debt into an economy takes the economy away from a simple commodity-money exchange, because money becomes the subject of contracts and repayment. In this way money gains more inherent power as it becomes the purpose of the sale. Money becomes the only commodity, and the use-value of actual commodities is lost.</p><p>On the world scale both silver and gold are used as currencies. Marx explains that world money functions not only &ldquo;as the universal means of payment [and] purchase&rdquo; but also &ldquo;as the absolute social materialization of wealth as such (universal wealth).&rdquo; Countries need two different reserves: one for their own internal market, and one for the world market. Money spreads outward from countries into other countries, where it is absorbed into internal markets to then spread outward again.</p><a href=#analysis-1><h2 id=analysis-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p>In Chapter 2 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Capital-Das-Kapital/author/ rel=noopener>Marx</a> sets up the concept of commodities, value, and exchange in the context of human relationships and social structure. In Chapter 1 his focus was primarily on the objects, or commodities, themselves. In this chapter he sets the commodity in the context of human society and re-examines it through this lens. Right away in this chapter Marx makes note of a contradiction that has arisen in his definition of value. He states, &ldquo;commodities must be realized as values before they can be realized as use-values.&rdquo; But then he goes on to say that it&rsquo;s equally true that commodities &ldquo;must stand the test as use-values before they can be realized as values.&rdquo; On one hand, commodities must be put on the market and seen in relation to one another (i.e., exchanged for one another) before they can be consumed or used. On the other hand, commodities only have a value if the items are useful to others. In the end both use-value and exchange-value must be taken into account to determine the worth of a commodity.</p><p>Much of the beginning of Chapter 3 focuses on different ways of elucidating one primary point: that money can only measure the value of a commodity in an imaginary way. This is touched upon in the last few pages of Chapter 2, but Marx examines the logic behind this concept thoroughly in the first section of Chapter 3. Generally, his approach in these early chapters is to thoroughly break down the most basic economic concepts—commodities, value, and money—in as much detail as possible to create a solid foundation for the rest of his theories throughout the text.</p><p>The second section of Chapter 3 is driven by a focus on the concept of money and its basic method of functioning in the market. Marx explains the exchange of commodities for money, which is then exchanged for commodities, as a circuit and a metamorphosis. He seems unimpressed with the idea of money, however. In sentences like, &ldquo;The circulation of money is the constant and monotonous repetition of the same process,&rdquo; the reader gets the impression that Marx is disdainful toward the presence of money in the commodity market. This is to be an underlying thread in his treatment of the capitalist economy in general. Marx&rsquo;s overall approach to explaining the basic functions of money in this chapter is to repeat the same concepts using slight variations in metaphor and examples. This connects to Marx&rsquo;s approach to the first section of the chapter, where he continues defining the basic elements of the market by setting up many different variations of similar situations.</p><p>Marx begins to take some jabs at capitalists and other economists, using language such as &ldquo;the absurd hypothesis adopted by the original representatives of this view&rdquo; to refer to people whose theories he disagrees with. These asides prove to be some of the more interesting and engaging insights into Marx&rsquo;s opinions about the material he is discussing.</p><p>Finally, in the third section of Chapter 3, Marx looks more carefully at the concept of money and the problems that may arise with it. He views hoarding as one of the worst problems that comes about with money. In his eyes someone who sells his commodities and doesn&rsquo;t put the money right back into circulation finds his money &ldquo;petrified into a hoard, and the seller of commodities becomes a hoarder of money.&rdquo; This &ldquo;hoarding&rdquo; can be connected back to the concept of the &ldquo;fetish&rdquo; that Marx claims people develop for commodities or money.</p><a href=#vol-1-part-2-chapter-4--the-transformation-of-money-into-capital-the-general-formula-for-capital--summary><h1 id=vol-1-part-2-chapter-4--the-transformation-of-money-into-capital-the-general-formula-for-capital--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Vol. 1, Part 2, Chapter 4 : The Transformation of Money into Capital (The General Formula for Capital) | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-2><h2 id=summary-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Capital-Das-Kapital/author/ rel=noopener>Marx</a> defines trade as &ldquo;the production of commodities and their circulation in its developed form.&rdquo; Money is a form of capital and is transformed into capital through various processes. The process of C-M-C is the &ldquo;direct form of circulation&rdquo; of commodities, and illustrates how money is used in its simple form. Marx calls this &ldquo;selling in order to buy.&rdquo; When money is in the form of capital, it is circulated as money-commodity-money, or M-C-Mʹ. (The latter money is higher than the original money input, as indicated by the prime symbol following the acronym.) This he calls &ldquo;buying in order to sell.&rdquo; This second process essentially results in exchanging money for money. Marx gives an illustration in which a person buys something for a certain amount and then resells that thing for more. Money has been essentially exchanged for more money.</p><p>One of the important differences between the C-M-C process and M-C-Mʹ is that in C-M-C, consumption (of the commodity) is the end goal. In contrast, M-C-M&rsquo; is driven by exchange-value. The accumulation and valorization of capital (i.e., the process of assigning value to it) is the goal of capitalism. When money is made from this M-C-M&rsquo; process, Marx calls this extra money &ldquo;surplus-value.&rdquo; The capitalist is constantly questing after this surplus-value, and &ldquo;his aim is &mldr; the unceasing movement of profit-making.&rdquo;</p><a href=#analysis-2><h2 id=analysis-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p>In this chapter

<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Capital-Das-Kapital/author/ rel=noopener>Marx</a> proposes to examine the labor process &ldquo;independently of any specific social formation.&rdquo; He specifies there is an important distinction between conscious human labor and the instinctive labor of animals. After specifying this, he breaks down the concept of labor into three basic elements:</p><ol><li>&ldquo;purposeful activity,&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;the object on which that work is performed,&rdquo; and</li><li>&ldquo;the instruments of that work.&rdquo;</li></ol><p>Some objects of labor are provided by nature, such as timber or other such resources, and some require work to become an object of labor, which are called &ldquo;raw materials.&rdquo; Commodities with use-values can be seen as raw materials, instruments of labor, or the product/commodity of that labor, depending on what part of the labor process they are used in. In this way Marx explains that &ldquo;labor consumes products in order to create products.&rdquo;</p><p>The &ldquo;would-be capitalist&rdquo; must purchase both the labor-power and the means of production (raw materials and instruments). Then, the capitalist consumes the commodity of the worker&rsquo;s labor. Marx states that the process of the laborer making a commodity is not essentially different when the laborer is working for the capitalist as opposed to themselves. While the basic process of production might be unaltered, there are two distinct characteristics of the process as a whole. First, the capitalist controls the labor of the worker whose labor they have purchased. Second, the product that results from the labor is not the property of the worker but instead the property of the capitalist.</p><p>Unlike a regular buyer of a commodity, the capitalist is not interested in the product for its own sake or for its use-value. Instead, the capitalist is interested solely in the exchange-value of the product. Marx states that the capitalist has two main agendas: &ldquo;to produce a use-value which has an exchange-value&rdquo; and to produce a product that is &ldquo;greater in value than the sum of the values of the commodities used to produce it.&rdquo; This refers to the &ldquo;surplus-value&rdquo; mentioned previously.</p><p>Next Marx attempts to analyze the &ldquo;process of creating value&rdquo; through production. In analyzing the production, it is necessary to &ldquo;calculate the quantity of labor objectified in it.&rdquo; Basically, the product or commodity of labor can be seen as &ldquo;embodied labor.&rdquo; Marx makes a particular point to emphasize that in this model, all labor must be viewed as the same—differentiations in types of labor are not made. The quantity of labor or amount of time spent on the labor is the only important characteristic of the labor. However, if the product of labor is the embodiment of the amount of labor, the question remains: how is surplus-value created?</p><p>Surplus-value is created in the difference between the expenditure of labor and the actual labor-time. A worker may need to work only half a day in order to create enough product to subsist on. However, if the worker is paid a subsistence wage but retained to work for 12 hours instead of six, he can create twice as much product on the same wage. This example illustrates the difference between the exchange-value of labor power, or how much it costs to produce/reproduce, and the use-value of labor-power, which is how much value it can produce. In this way the capitalist manages to work the system to his favor. Capitalists buy materials at their value and sell the product at its value, but the labor process is where they make their surplus.</p><a href=#analysis-5><h2 id=analysis-5><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Capital-Das-Kapital/author/ rel=noopener>Marx</a> finds it important to clarify the difference between human and animal labor. He uses examples to illustrate this distinction, explaining that the difference between what an architect does and what a bee does &ldquo;is that the architect builds the cell in his mind before he constructs it in wax.&rdquo; Inherently, what Marx seems to be identifying as the difference between animal labor and human labor is the presence or lack of creativity and purpose. The bee builds from instinct and imprint, whereas the person builds with specific purpose, forming the plans in his mind out of creative drive. The human mind is instrumental in the process of human labor, because it possesses the power of intellect. Thus, ideas play a crucial part in the processes through which humanity produces and reproduces itself.</p><p>In this chapter Marx focuses on &ldquo;objects of labor&rdquo; and &ldquo;instruments of labor.&rdquo; He makes a point of distinguishing between raw materials and materials taken straight from nature that are already useful. The term <em>instrument</em>, he states, names something that utilizes &ldquo;the mechanical, physical and chemical properties of some substances &mldr; to set them to work.&rdquo; Marx also sees the relationship between humanity and nature as a metabolic one, where a bidirectional transformation happens. Humans adapt new technology in response to natural conditions and fluctuations.</p><p>As the chapter progresses, Marx points out some important distinctions of the capitalist-bought labor process. These distinctions have to do with control and ownership. The capitalist owns the labor of and pays the wage to the worker, giving him a sort of control over the laborer that doesn&rsquo;t exist in the simpler system of equal-value exchange. He gets closer to the reason he sees capitalists as people who are &ldquo;at home in vulgar economics.&rdquo;</p><p>Marx&rsquo;s dislike of the capitalist system becomes abundantly clear in his explanation of how surplus-value works. The surplus-value, or profit, is being made off the worker, who must work more in order to make ends meet. In a system where commodities are simply traded for other commodities, even with money as a sort of middleman, the laborer has to work only as much as necessary to produce enough of a commodity to live. In the capitalist system, the worker must work much more in order to survive. His work, in turn, gives the capitalist a lot of power over the worker, for the capitalist now sets the time and the pay for the labor, and the worker has no choice but to work double to survive. Additionally, the capitalist &ldquo;is to ensure that his workmen are not idle for a single moment&rdquo; to get the most profit for his money. Meanwhile, the worker makes no profit at all, but instead works double for the same amount of money.</p><hr><a href=#vol-1-part-3-chapters-89--the-production-of-absolute-surplus-value--summary><h1 id=vol-1-part-3-chapters-89--the-production-of-absolute-surplus-value--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Vol. 1, Part 3, Chapters 8–9 : The Production of Absolute Surplus-Value | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-6><h2 id=summary-6><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><a href=#chapter-8-constant-capital-and-variable-capital><h3 id=chapter-8-constant-capital-and-variable-capital><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 8: Constant Capital and Variable Capital</h3></a><p>The value of the product of labor has multiple factors. The values of all of the parts of labor—the worker&rsquo;s labor, the instruments used, and so on—are transferred to the product of that labor. 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Capital-Das-Kapital/author/ rel=noopener>Marx</a> reinforces the concept that labor should be viewed as abstract social labor and not differentiated by specific types. Marx explains two aspects of labor-value. He states that &ldquo;by the simple addition of a certain quantity of labor, new value is added.&rdquo; Additionally, the quality of that labor causes &ldquo;the original values of the means of production [to be] preserved in the product.&rdquo;</p><p>Marx discusses the concept of use-value again in this chapter, pointing out that all commodities with a use-value that are used for making further commodities &ldquo;only give up to the product the value they themselves lose as means of production.&rdquo; Thus, the value is transferred from instruments and raw materials into the final product. Marx calls this &ldquo;constant capital.&rdquo; Conversely, variable capital is what Marx terms &ldquo;that part of capital which is turned into labor-power.&rdquo;</p><a href=#chapter-9-the-rate-of-surplus-value><h3 id=chapter-9-the-rate-of-surplus-value><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 9: The Rate of Surplus-Value</h3></a><p>Marx begins this chapter by setting up an equation to illustrate how surplus-value is created. In this equation <em>C</em> stands for the total capital, and it consists of <em>c</em> (the money paid for means of production, or the <em>constant capital</em>) and <em>v</em> (the money paid for labor, which is the <em>variable capital</em>). Thus, <em>C</em> = <em>c</em> + <em>v</em>. However, after the labor is completed the surplus must be considered in the equation, which now looks like this: <em>Cʹ</em> = (<em>c</em> + <em>v</em>) + <em>s</em>. Marx refers to the rate of increase of surplus-value from the variable capital as the &ldquo;rate of surplus-value.&rdquo; It is important to distinguish between the rate of surplus-value, which looks at the surplus in relation to the variable capital, and the &ldquo;rate of profit,&rdquo; which considers the surplus in relation to the whole capital (the <em>C</em> in the equation).</p><p>In the second part of this chapter Marx simply tweaks this equation to illustrate how it can be representative of any of the different parts of the production process: money, time, weight, and so on. For instance, <em>C</em> could be used to represent total money, total time, and so on.</p><p>The last part of Chapter 9 focuses on criticizing a theory proposed by the English economist Nassau W. Senior. Senior argued against an act that would have reduced working hours from 11 to 10 hours. His argument was based on the idea that a one-hour reduction would cause the manufacturers (the capitalists, in this example) to lose their entire profit. Marx uses the rate of surplus-value to counter this argument, showing that a one-hour reduction would simply cause the reduction of a percentage of the profit relative to the labor wages.</p><a href=#analysis-6><h2 id=analysis-6><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p>Chapter 8 revisits much of the same information about labor that was discussed in Chapter 7. 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Capital-Das-Kapital/author/ rel=noopener>Marx</a> uses the example of yarn and the labor of spinning to illustrate how labor-value works. This information is basically a rehashing of his earlier explanations of how labor and value function. Marx draws a distinction between the capital whose value stays constant during the production process, such as raw materials, and the capital whose value changes or increases during production, or labor-power. Thus, labor-power is the element of the production process that creates surplus value.</p><p>Chapter 9 continues to lay out some basic definitions of concepts that Marx will use throughout the text. In this chapter Marx works on using equations to clearly illustrate the different components of the production process, and how they work together to equal the total capital. He also introduces the concept of &ldquo;exploitation of the worker,&rdquo; arguing that the &ldquo;rate of surplus-value&rdquo; can be seen as &ldquo;an exact expression for the degree of exploitation &mldr; of the worker by the capitalist.&rdquo; Marx sees the arguments of capitalists like 19th-century economist Nassau Senior as attempts to milk the absolute maximum profit out of the worker, with little care for the conditions or quality of life of that worker. The fact that manufacturers and capitalists alike refused to give workers a one-hour reduction in the work day illustrates a desperation for and obsession with the concept of the surplus, or profit.</p><hr><a href=#vol-1-part-3-chapter-10--the-production-of-absolute-surplus-value-the-working-day--summary><h1 id=vol-1-part-3-chapter-10--the-production-of-absolute-surplus-value-the-working-day--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Vol. 1, Part 3, Chapter 10 : The Production of Absolute Surplus-Value (The Working Day) | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-7><h2 id=summary-7><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Capital-Das-Kapital/author/ rel=noopener>Marx</a> opens Chapter 10 with a reiteration of the variable nature of the working day. It is difficult to pinpoint the minimum value of labor, because there are so many variables involved (such as place, time, and living conditions). Marx proposes the basic equation that the minimum limit of labor-time in the working day can be generally assumed as the amount of time needed for the workers to sustain themselves, though in the capitalist system it is more difficult to determine the minimum. The maximum working day is based on multiple factors, and &ldquo;fluctuates within boundaries both physical and social.&rdquo; The worker, since his labor is the commodity the capitalist has purchased, rationally wants a work day that reflects his actual compensation. The capitalist wants maximum profit and therefore the longest possible work day. In the end the resulting work day length is somewhere between the two.</p><p>Later in this chapter Marx discusses the shift system and the changes in length in the working day throughout the 19th century. Capital is value in motion, and when it is not in motion, that is, when the process of production and circulation pauses, it ceases to increase in value. Because it is impossible for a worker to work 24 hours every day, the capitalist uses a shift system to keep production going day and night. This increases surplus-value even further. However, the assumption of the 24-hour work day also assumes no time for the worker to do anything except work. Workers are viewed simply as labor machines in this system, which &ldquo;usurps the time for growth, development and healthy maintenance of the body.&rdquo;</p><p>The last part of Chapter 10 focuses on the development of the working day and the laws that have affected it. Britain gradually passed laws throughout the 19th century that limited the working day and age of children in factories, but other parts of Europe were ahead of Britain in these measures. Children still worked 8–12 hour days in many factories. In 1866 both the U.S. and Britain agreed to a standard 8-hour working day.</p><a href=#analysis-7><h2 id=analysis-7><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Capital-Das-Kapital/author/ rel=noopener>Marx</a>&rsquo;s focus in this chapter is on detailing the conditions and unreasonable length of the working day in 19th-century capitalist Europe. He makes it clear that the necessary working day and the working day preferred by the capitalist are two very different things. In the capitalist system the working day should be the maximum length possible to create the most surplus-value possible from the labor. In Marx&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;Capital is dead labor which, vampire-like, lives only by sucking living labor.&rdquo; The thirst for profit in relation to prizing exchange-value has resulted in societies that use slave-labor as a way to create massive surplus-value. Marx points out that overwork is a common problem in the capitalist system. Vampires aren&rsquo;t the only creatures to which Marx likens capitalists. He also comments on capitalists&rsquo; &ldquo;werewolf-like hunger for surplus labor.&rdquo;</p><p>In Chapter 10 Marx aims to paint a picture of the results of capitalism in relation to workers&rsquo; lives that will help readers understand their own views. The image he draws is one of factories with squalid, dangerous conditions, unsustainably long hours, and massive amounts of child labor. All this labor is paid the absolute minimum living wage, and the lifespan of the workers is considerably shorter than it would be under more humane conditions.</p><p>Capitalism prizes exchange-value over use-value, and thus overwork becomes a common result of the system. The unchecked desire for surplus-value in capitalism eventually led to a need for some sort of legal restrictions to be put in place. Marx describes various types of labor and the conditions that often coincide with long working hours. For instance, young children worked 15-hour days in factories, and adults up to 18 hours, with terrible conditions that often led to early death. Some trades fought back, but many types of laborers did not have the power to influence their working conditions.</p><p>In this chapter Marx also details the progression of laws that affected both the length of the working day and the ages and conditions of the workers. It is not hard to see why Marx detests the capitalist system, for in his definition capitalists are heartless overseers who live for profit at the expense of their laborers.</p><hr><a href=#vol-1-part-3-chapter-11--the-production-of-absolute-surplus-value-the-rate-and-mass-of-surplus-value--summary><h1 id=vol-1-part-3-chapter-11--the-production-of-absolute-surplus-value-the-rate-and-mass-of-surplus-value--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Vol. 1, Part 3, Chapter 11 : The Production of Absolute Surplus-Value (The Rate and Mass of Surplus-Value) | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-8><h2 id=summary-8><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p>In this chapter

Basically, if a worker needs to work a certain number of hours to produce enough to pay a living wage, then in the capitalist system that worker will work more hours than the necessary amount for the same amount of living wage. The extra hours of work (over what would be necessary in a basic exchange system) are the surplus-value taken by the capitalist. The amount of surplus value can be multiplied by the number of workers, and the total daily surplus-value, or the &ldquo;mass of surplus-value&rdquo; can be found.</p><a href=#analysis-8><h2 id=analysis-8><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Capital-Das-Kapital/author/ rel=noopener>Marx</a> reminds readers in this chapter—in which is a foundational part of his argument about capitalism—that all his calculations and formulae are based on the concept of the &ldquo;average worker&rdquo; and &ldquo;average labor.&rdquo; He recognizes that there are exceptional cases in both directions—some workers might overproduce while others might underproduce. Marx&rsquo;s theory is based on the supposition that these two extremes balance out into an average worker&rsquo;s average labor, or that some capitalists can get ahead by producing more surplus value and having better labor, while others will fall behind. This is all part of the capitalist system&rsquo;s complexity.</p><hr><a href=#vol-1-part-4-chapters-1213--the-production-of-relative-surplus-value--summary><h1 id=vol-1-part-4-chapters-1213--the-production-of-relative-surplus-value--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Vol. 1, Part 4, Chapters 12–13 : The Production of Relative Surplus-Value | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-9><h2 id=summary-9><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><a href=#chapter-12-the-concept-of-relative-surplus-value><h3 id=chapter-12-the-concept-of-relative-surplus-value><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 12: The Concept of Relative Surplus-Value</h3></a><p>Here 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Capital-Das-Kapital/author/ rel=noopener>Marx</a> introduces the concept of &ldquo;relative surplus-value.&rdquo; Though surplus-value has been treated so far as a constant, Marx informs his reader that the situation isn&rsquo;t quite so simple. If the length of the working day remains constant, then in order to increase the surplus labor the necessary labor must be shortened: &ldquo;prolongation of surplus labor would correspond to a shortening of necessary labor.&rdquo; In order to make this possible, an increase in productivity must take place. Marx divides surplus-value into two categories: relative and absolute. Absolute surplus-value is surplus-value achieved by the lengthening of the working day. Relative surplus-value is surplus-value created by &ldquo;shortening the necessary labor-time&rdquo; and thus creating more surplus labor-time.</p><a href=#chapter-13-co-operation><h3 id=chapter-13-co-operation><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 13: Co-operation</h3></a><p>In Chapter 13 Marx breaks down capitalist production in more detail. According to Marx, the &ldquo;starting-point of capitalist production&rdquo; is created by &ldquo;a large number of workers working together, at the same time, in one place&rdquo; who are all producing &ldquo;the same sort of commodity under the command of the same capitalist.&rdquo; In this type of production workers lose their individual qualities and become a mass of average social labor. Marx explains that when a group of workers labor &ldquo;side by side in accordance with a plan &mldr; this form of labor is called co-operation,&rdquo; thus the title of the chapter. In order for this type of collective labor to work, it must be directed by an authority figure. Marx likens the capitalist bringing together his workers to how &ldquo;a general should command on the field of battle.&rdquo; The cooperation of workers, under the direction of the capitalist, is the &ldquo;fundamental form of the capitalist mode of production.&rdquo; It is important to note that cooperation is a natural human mode of working, but the introduction of the capitalist &ldquo;master&rdquo; is what makes this mode particular to capitalism.</p><a href=#analysis-9><h2 id=analysis-9><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p>In order to increase production—which 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Capital-Das-Kapital/author/ rel=noopener>Marx</a> proposes as the only way to shorten necessary labor-time and thus create more surplus labor—Marx looks to technology. Technology and machinery are the important elements that create the possibility of greater productivity. They allow more commodities to be created at a faster rate. Since Marx is highly critical of capitalism, it&rsquo;s possible to infer that he might also be critical of technological development intended to increase labor productivity. In the capitalist system, the development of technology is driven by a desire to increase productivity, not to create a better quality of life for the workers. In fact, years later Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi would find similar issue with capitalist ideas of widespread industry and the technology that allowed it, and would become a proponent of cottage industry and small-scale, worker-centric local production.</p><p>Marx sees the constant striving of capitalism toward cheaper, faster labor as a drive &ldquo;to cheapen commodities and, by cheapening commodities, to cheapen the worker himself.&rdquo; Though new machinery and technology could help to shorten the worker&rsquo;s workday, which is something that would benefit the worker, this is not the goal of the capitalist. The capitalist&rsquo;s goal is to shorten the amount of time the worker works for themselves, in order to increase the time they work for the capitalist.</p><p>In Chapter 13 Marx continues the thread of Chapter 12. In these chapters he concretely examines the concepts that he addressed in earlier chapters in the abstract. He moves from theoretical concepts of labor and labor-time to the reality of how the capitalist work system must be organized and the importance of highly productive machinery in that process. The cooperation of workers as a collective under the pay and direction of the capitalist is essential for the system to succeed. There is no room in the system for the importance or skills of the individual. Average labor working on a massive, cooperative scale—as though the workers are one unified entity—is the foundation of how labor was organized in capitalism in Marx&rsquo;s time. While cooperation is a natural tendency of humankind, this particular cooperation is controlled by the capitalists. The capitalists hold power over the workers, and thus &ldquo;subjects their activity to his purpose.&rdquo;</p><hr><a href=#vol-1-part-4-chapters-1415--the-production-of-relative-surplus-value--summary><h1 id=vol-1-part-4-chapters-1415--the-production-of-relative-surplus-value--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span> Vol. 1, Part 4, Chapters 14–15 : The Production of Relative Surplus-Value | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-10><h2 id=summary-10><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><a href=#chapter-14-the-division-of-labor-and-manufacture><h3 id=chapter-14-the-division-of-labor-and-manufacture><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 14: The Division of Labor and Manufacture</h3></a><p>According to 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Capital-Das-Kapital/author/ rel=noopener>Marx</a>, there are two basic types of manufacturing in the capitalist system. In the first type the workers each contribute a part of a whole commodity. Marx gives the example of a complex item like a carriage passing through many different workers&rsquo; hands, each one creating a part. The second type of manufacture has all the workers doing the same small task over and over, such as making paper. This repetitious approach to working causes workers to lose their individuality and become machine-like, which is what the capitalist system wants. In order to streamline manufacturing, tools must also be altered to fit the more specific and singular purposes of this type of production. Manufacturing items using this division of labor creates a type of production that maximizes time, as the product can be handed continuously from one set of hands to another, all constantly working. As Marx explains, the &ldquo;labor processes can proceed uninterruptedly, simultaneously, and side by side.&rdquo;</p><p>While the division of labor in a society might not look so different initially from the division of labor in manufacturing, there is a crucial distinction. Marx gives the example of the creation of a pair of shoes: how one person raises the cattle, the next tans the leather, the next makes the shoes. These represent the natural division of labor in the process of producing a commodity. However, in this system each craftsman is creating his own commodity, whereas in the capitalist system &ldquo;the specialized worker produces no commodities.&rdquo; In this way the division of labor in a society can exist in many economic systems, the &ldquo;division of labor in the workshop&rdquo; is unique to capitalism. In this system the worker loses much of his value as a specialized worker and becomes an impoverished cog in the machine. This, in turn, is detrimental to the worker&rsquo;s mental and physical health.</p><a href=#chapter-15-machinery-and-large-scale-industry><h3 id=chapter-15-machinery-and-large-scale-industry><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 15: Machinery and Large-Scale Industry</h3></a><p>Marx asks &ldquo;what the difference is between a machine and an implement used in a handicraft.&rdquo; The implements used for handicrafts are present in machines, but a machine, once set by a worker in motion, &ldquo;performs with its tools the same operations as the worker formerly did with similar tools.&rdquo; In manufacture one machine soon becomes part of a larger system of machines, all in cooperation. Machinery in capitalist manufacture, Marx points out, is not meant to lighten the burden of the worker but instead to create surplus-value. The machinery itself, however, doesn&rsquo;t actually create value &ldquo;but yields up its own value to the product it serves to beget.&rdquo; Marx describes machinery as entering &ldquo;only piece by piece into the process of valorization.&rdquo; This means that the machine has an overall value, but this differs from the way it transmits value to the commodity it helps to create, which is affected by the depreciation of the machine as it puts energy into the product.</p><p>The introduction of machinery into production has also allowed for the employment of more women and children, because a certain level of bodily strength is no longer necessary for production. Another negative effect of machinery is the prolongation of the working day, as the workers can expend less energy and work longer, and the machines experience a faster turnover. This longer work day leads also to an &ldquo;intensification of labor.&rdquo; So instead of aiding workers and lightening their labor, the machines intensify it. The use of machines and employment of unskilled labor leads to a general &ldquo;deskilling&rdquo; of the whole working class.</p><p>There is a long history of contention between workers and machines. Machines typically have improved speed and efficiency of different tasks but almost always render workers unnecessary in the process. Marx argues that an instrument used for producing commodities, in &ldquo;the form of a machine, immediately becomes a competitor of the worker himself.&rdquo; Many political economists of the time argued that the use of machines &ldquo;sets free an amount of capital adequate to employ precisely those workers displaced&rdquo;: meaning that more mechanics will have to be employed to create more machines, etc. However, Marx argues that this is illogical and illustrates that not as many jobs are created by the production of machines as are displaced by their use. In addition, the skills needed to make one type of commodity are not necessarily transferable to making a machine or different commodity.</p><a href=#analysis-10><h2 id=analysis-10><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p>In Chapter 14 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Capital-Das-Kapital/author/ rel=noopener>Marx</a> gets into more detail about how labor-power is maximized in the capitalist system. Since labor-power is the place where the surplus-value is created, its maximization is the foundation of what makes capitalism possible. Manufacturing using a division of labor allows for this process to be streamlined and speeds up production. It is important to note that even in the second type of capitalist manufacturing, the workers still do different jobs, and there is still division of labor. In this early type of assembly-line style system, each worker does a different minute part of the process of creating a single item. This takes away the craftsmanship aspect of creation and causes a situation where a worker is doing only one tiny part of a job in endless repetition. This is what Marx points out makes the workers like part of a machine, instead of individual craftsman.</p><p>The division of labor in the workshop, as opposed to in a general community, is common in the capitalist system. In the workshop, when labor is divided, a situation occurs where each person does a segment of labor that does not create a commodity they can sell—it only has value as part of the larger whole. This gives the capitalist—or head of the workshop—control over the workers in a way that doesn&rsquo;t naturally exist in other economic systems. Usually, each person creates his own commodity and sells it to the next person, who might use that commodity to make something else. This is a crucial part of Marx&rsquo;s argument about why, in the capitalist system, the workers are now selling <em>labor-power</em> instead of actual commodities. Marx argues that the system that causes a worker to do the same repetitive work for hours on end &ldquo;mutilates the worker, turning him into a fragment of himself.&rdquo; This uniformity of mental and physical movement, day in and day out, creates a situation where the worker&rsquo;s physical and mental health deteriorates drastically. So, in effect, not only does the system give the capitalist financial power over the worker, but it also drains the very life-force of the worker as well.</p><p>Not only are workers expected to play the parts of machines, but machines themselves are a crucial part of capitalist manufacture. Machines bring together the old tools of handicraft into a single complex device that requires manpower to be set in motion. Machines, like the workers in a factory, are also created to work in cooperation with other machines, so that a network of machines and workers all working in concert with one another maximizes production.</p><p>It is important to note that machines themselves do not create new value but instead transfer the value of their own manufacture and energy expenditure to the product they are creating. Thus, they are only worthwhile if the machine&rsquo;s &ldquo;value added to the product remains smaller than the value added by the worker.&rdquo;</p><p>Marx sees machinery as a largely negative addition in the context of capitalism. He outlines the major effects it has had on industrial manufacturing. Marx saw the inclusion of women and children in the process as a source of &ldquo;moral degradation.&rdquo; While he also deplores the brutal environments in which women and children worked, he makes a point to quote a doctor who illustrates the moral repercussions of adult women leaving their families at home to go to work.</p><p>Machines, Marx argues, create a general &ldquo;deskilling&rdquo; of labor in a given society. That society would have had at one time a diverse array of artisans and craftsmen who provided skilled labor and created individual commodities. However, the division of labor and introduction of machines create workers who act as automatons, understanding only one tiny part of the whole process. This results in an overall loss in skilled labor in a community and means that the knowledge of hand-making some types of crafts might be completely lost. Machines have also had a long history of putting laborers out of work. Whenever a new machine is introduced into a particular field, inevitably the skilled laborers who previously did the work are suddenly no longer relevant.</p><hr><a href=#vol-1-part-5-chapters-1618--the-production-of-absolute-and-relative-surplus-value--summary><h1 id=vol-1-part-5-chapters-1618--the-production-of-absolute-and-relative-surplus-value--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Vol. 1, Part 5, Chapters 16–18 : The Production of Absolute and Relative Surplus-Value | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-11><h2 id=summary-11><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><a href=#chapter-16-absolute-and-relative-surplus-value><h3 id=chapter-16-absolute-and-relative-surplus-value><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 16: Absolute and Relative Surplus-Value</h3></a><p>In this chapter, 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Capital-Das-Kapital/author/ rel=noopener>Marx</a> addresses the definition of productive labor, explaining that &ldquo;it is no longer necessary for the individual himself to put his hand to the object.&rdquo; The individual instead becomes a piece of the larger collective labor. Productivity is no longer measured by the commodity produced, but by the surplus-value produced. The notion of the collective laborer incorporates labor not directly involved in material production as part of the overall production process. Marx also clarifies the definition of productive labor under capitalism to only those forms of labor that produce surplus values. He reiterates the idea of absolute surplus-value, giving examples to further illustrate the concept. At some point relative surplus-value and absolute surplus-value seem to merge. Marx shows that relative surplus-value can actually be viewed as absolute &ldquo;because it requires the absolute prolongation of the working day beyond &mldr; labor-time.&rdquo; In the same sense absolute surplus-value is really relative as well &ldquo;because it requires a development of the productivity of labor&rdquo; that limits the worker&rsquo;s necessary labor-time to part of the working day. However, Marx argues that ultimately, relative surplus-value depends on the continuous attempts by capitalism to decrease the necessary work time (with machines and other things to increase worker productivity) in order to increase surplus-value.</p><a href=#chapter-17-changes-of-magnitude-in-the-price-of-labor-power-and-in-surplus-value><h3 id=chapter-17-changes-of-magnitude-in-the-price-of-labor-power-and-in-surplus-value><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 17: Changes of Magnitude in the Price of Labor-Power and in Surplus-Value</h3></a><p>Marx points out that the amount of subsistence needed by an individual changes depending on environmental and various other factors. This quantity of subsistence, along with the cost of development of labor-power, and the diversity of types of labor available, are the three factors that determine the value of labor-power. Marx states that there are three things that determine the &ldquo;magnitudes of surplus-labor and of price of labor-power&rdquo;: 1) &ldquo;the length of the working day,&rdquo; 2) &ldquo;the &ldquo;intensive magnitude&rdquo; of labor, &ldquo;whereby a given quantity of labor is expended in a given time&rdquo; and 3) &ldquo;the productivity of labor.&rdquo; Marx then examines four different scenarios in which these three circumstances vary/remain constant. In the first he discusses what happens when &ldquo;the length of the working day and the intensity of labor [remain] constant&rdquo; but the productivity of labor varies. In the second situation, &ldquo;the length of the working day and the productivity of labor [remain] constant&rdquo; but &ldquo;the intensity of labor [is] variable.&rdquo; The third scenario has constants of productivity and intensity of labor, but the length of the working day is varied. The final scenario looks at the simultaneous variation of all three circumstances.</p><a href=#chapter-18-different-formulae-for-the-rate-of-surplus-value><h3 id=chapter-18-different-formulae-for-the-rate-of-surplus-value><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 18: Different Formulae for the Rate of Surplus-Value</h3></a><p>Chapter 18 is simply a series of different formulae that Marx proposes can be used to calculate the rate of surplus-value.

He explains productivity as something undesirable, because it rewards the capitalist but not the worker. To this end he argues that &ldquo;to be a productive worker is therefore not a piece of luck, but a misfortune.&rdquo; Marx takes the reader on a winding route to illustrate how relative and absolute surplus-value actually do exist as separate concepts, pointing out how they might seem interchangeable and then giving a winding explanation as to why they are not. He also spends the last few pages of the chapter introducing and contradicting the arguments of John Stuart Mill, a contemporary political economist of Marx&rsquo;s, about capitalist production.</p><p>In Chapter 17 Marx introduces a range of situations in which three circumstances of surplus-value can vary. He focuses primarily, however, on two specific situations. The first is the case of &ldquo;diminishing productivity of labor with simultaneous lengthening of the working day.&rdquo; To illustrate this situation, Marx gives the example of a farmer who experiences &ldquo;diminishing productivity resulting from the diminishing fertility of the soil,&rdquo; which lengthens his work day and leads to a &ldquo;corresponding increase in the prices of its products.&rdquo;</p><p>Marx&rsquo;s second example illustrates relative surplus-value, in the situation of &ldquo;increasing intensity and productivity of labor with simultaneous shortening of the working day.&rdquo; In the capitalist system the working day being shortened here is of course not the overall day, but is the &ldquo;necessary labor&rdquo; portion of the working day. Normally, this type of shift would be beneficial to the worker, but within the capitalist system it only adds to the workload. Ultimately, the main idea here is that the length of the working day, the intensity of the labor, and the productivity of that labor all vary and this variation affects surplus value.</p><hr><a href=#vol-1-part-6-chapters-1922--wages--summary><h1 id=vol-1-part-6-chapters-1922--wages--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Vol. 1, Part 6, Chapters 19–22 : Wages | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-12><h2 id=summary-12><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><a href=#chapter-19-the-transformation-of-the-value-and-respectively-the-price-of-labor-power-into-wages><h3 id=chapter-19-the-transformation-of-the-value-and-respectively-the-price-of-labor-power-into-wages><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 19: The Transformation of the Value (and Respectively the Price) of Labor-Power into Wages</h3></a><p>In Chapter 19 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Capital-Das-Kapital/author/ rel=noopener>Marx</a> examines the question, &ldquo;How is the price of labor determined?&rdquo; He proposes that the price at which labor rests &ldquo;at the moment when demand and supply are in equilibrium &mldr; is its natural price.&rdquo; This natural price should be the focus of analysis, and not the oscillation of the price under supply and demand. In searching for the value of labor, Marx argues, political economists were actually asking the question, &ldquo;What is the cost of production (which is the cost of producing/reproducing the worker)?&rdquo; and mixed up the value of labor with the value of labor-power. Marx points out that &ldquo;the value of labor must always be less than its value-product,&rdquo; meaning that the value of labor in the capitalist system must always be lower than the commodity being produced, otherwise the capitalist would have no surplus-value and would make no money.</p><a href=#chapter-20-time-wages><h3 id=chapter-20-time-wages><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 20: Time-Wages</h3></a><p>There are two fundamental forms of wages. Chapter 20 deals with the &ldquo;time-wage.&rdquo; The time-wage is what it sounds like: it is defined as the wage &ldquo;in which the daily value, weekly value, etc. of labor-power is directly presented.&rdquo; In other words a time-wage is a wage that is paid for a set amount of time and can be measured in days, weeks, or other increments. In the case that the capitalist decides on a fixed daily wage, they might add more hours to the working day and thus decrease the amount the worker is earning per hour. With a fixed hourly wage the capitalist may add or detract hours from the working day and not guarantee the worker a living wage. Marx introduces the concept of overtime, wherein the capitalist pays the worker a higher wage for hours worked outside the affixed working day. However, according to Marx the overtime wage is &ldquo;often in a proportion which is ridiculously small.&rdquo;</p><a href=#chapter-21-piece-wages><h3 id=chapter-21-piece-wages><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 21: Piece-Wages</h3></a><p>Chapter 21 examines the second type of wage, which Marx calls the &ldquo;piece-wage.&rdquo; He begins by stating that &ldquo;the piece-wage is nothing but a converted form of the time-wage.&rdquo; A piece-wage refers to the type of wage that is paid by the piece or job. For instance, a worker might be offered a certain amount of money in order to complete a given job, such as helping build a ship or making a saddle. In order for a capitalist to make surplus-value off this type of wage system, they must calculate the amount of time required to produce a certain number of pieces, and then be sure to calculate in surplus labor when setting a wage. Thus, the worker makes an item and is paid only a fraction of that item&rsquo;s actual exchange-value. Piece wages also allow the capitalist to set a certain standard of efficiency—that is, if the capitalist decides that a certain piece should be completed in an hour, and the worker can&rsquo;t meet that standard, then the worker is fired.</p><a href=#chapter-22-national-differences-in-wages><h3 id=chapter-22-national-differences-in-wages><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 22: National Differences in Wages</h3></a><p>Chapter 22 is simply a brief study of the differences in wages across different European countries. There are certain factors that influence how the value of labor-power is factored across different countries, such as the general cost of living, &ldquo;the cost of training the workers &mldr; the labor of women and children, [and] the productivity of labor.&rdquo; Marx also proposes that the &ldquo;average intensity of labor&rdquo; and &ldquo;average productivity&rdquo; differ from country to country. Marx then gives two case studies concerning the spinning industry in England and Europe, and the railroads being built in Eastern Europe and Asia.</p><a href=#analysis-12><h2 id=analysis-12><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p>Section 6 primarily focuses on the concept of the wage and how workers&rsquo; labor is valued and compensated. 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Capital-Das-Kapital/author/ rel=noopener>Marx</a> sees the daily wage as a way to cover up the fact that workers are producing both necessary labor and surplus labor. Putting value on the work day allows the capitalist to set a price for labor that incorporates both necessary labor and surplus-value without paying the actual value for the amount of labor worked.</p><p>In one of the key points for his text, Marx argues that &ldquo;the form of appearance &mldr; makes the actual relation invisible.&rdquo; In other words, the &ldquo;form of appearance,&rdquo; or the daily wage, covers up what is actually happening with regard to the amount of work being done and the value of the commodity being produced. As with his discussion of commodity fetishism and his rejection of circulation as a source of surplus-value, Marx Is critiquing conventional political economy by illuminating the many ways in which what &ldquo;appears&rdquo; to be the case for capitalist production is not really the case.</p><p>Regarding time-based wages, Marx points out an interesting flaw in the hourly wage argument. It might seem that the hourly wage is fairer to the worker, because when they are paid a daily wage it is easier to cover up the necessary labor/surplus labor discrepancy. However, if the capitalist agrees to pay the worker an hourly wage, then the capitalist can reduce the hours of a given working day and only &ldquo;pay wages for the hours during which he chooses to employ the worker.&rdquo; This gives the capitalist the power to change the hours in a working day and thus creates the potential for a worker to find themselves not working enough hours to make a living wage. Marx points out that this also makes it possible for the capitalist to &ldquo;wring from the worker a certain quantity of surplus labor&rdquo; which then, in turn, doesn&rsquo;t allow the worker &ldquo;the labor-time necessary for his own subsistence.&rdquo;</p><p>The piece-wage is, in Marx&rsquo;s opinion, even more problematic than the time-based wage. Because employers essentially equate the creation or work on a certain piece with a certain amount of time, the piece-wage allows employers to create a competitive environment where the workers are constantly pushing to become more efficient—or do more work in a shorter amount of time and create more surplus-value for the employer. It also creates the false illusion that workers are being paid for the commodity they are producing, or their &ldquo;product is being paid for and not [their] labor-power.&rdquo;</p><p>To wrap up Part 6 Marx delves into some examples of different wage and production rates across England and Europe. He makes a point to quote and poke fun at the arguments of American economic theorist Henry Charles Carey, whom he accuses of &ldquo;shuffling a confused mass of statistical material to and fro in his usual &mldr; superficial manner.&rdquo;</p><hr><a href=#vol-1-part-7-chapters-2325--the-process-of-accumulation-of-capital--summary><h1 id=vol-1-part-7-chapters-2325--the-process-of-accumulation-of-capital--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Vol. 1, Part 7, Chapters 23–25 : The Process of Accumulation of Capital | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-13><h2 id=summary-13><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><a href=#chapter-23-simple-reproduction><h3 id=chapter-23-simple-reproduction><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 23: Simple Reproduction</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Capital-Das-Kapital/author/ rel=noopener>Marx</a> begins Chapter 23 with the concept that &ldquo;every social process of production is at the same time a process of reproduction.&rdquo; Essentially Marx is arguing that the process of production, because it is part of the cyclical process of production and consumption, is also a process of reproduction. Capitalism as well must be part of the continuous cycle, wherein the capitalist makes capital continuously and not just on a one-time basis. In the capitalist system, while the capitalist increases wealth through the cycle of production-consumption-reproduction, the worker actually walks away depleted. In this way workers&rsquo; labor becomes alienated from the workers and &ldquo;appropriated by the capitalist.&rdquo; In order for the system to continue, the worker/working class relationship must also be continually reproduced. This process leads to a larger cycle of social relationships than those within a factory.</p><a href=#chapter-24-the-transformation-of-surplus-value-into-capital><h3 id=chapter-24-the-transformation-of-surplus-value-into-capital><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 24: The Transformation of Surplus-Value into Capital</h3></a><p>Chapter 24 consists of five sections. Its first section focuses on the process of accumulation of capital. Marx defines the accumulation of capital as &ldquo;the employment of surplus-value as capital, or its reconversion into capital.&rdquo; For surplus-value to become capital, it must be reinvested in additional workers and increased production. The second section deals with economic theories of German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831) and Scottish social philosopher and economist Adam Smith (1723–90), which Marx believes are erroneous. He says that they make a correct distinction between hoarding money and reinvesting it as capital. However, these theories are wrong to suppose that accumulation is &ldquo;nothing more than the consumption of the surplus product by productive workers.&rdquo; Basically, Marx disagrees with Smith&rsquo;s argument that the surplus-value is simply transformed directly into labor-power.</p><p>In the third section Marx points out that he has examined surplus-value as something the capitalist consumes and also as accumulated capital. Here, he brings both concepts together and proposes that surplus-value is both things: &ldquo;One part of the surplus-value is consumed by the capitalist as revenue,&rdquo; he argues, while &ldquo;the other part is employed as capital, i.e. it is accumulated.&rdquo; A large part of the rest of the section is spent poking fun at Nassau W. Senior&rsquo;s theory of abstinence. In this theory Nassau attempts to glorify capitalism by replacing the word &ldquo;capital&rdquo; with the term &ldquo;abstinence.&rdquo; Marx insists that this achieves nothing more than replacing &ldquo;an economic category with a sycophantic phrase.&rdquo; Section 4 provides a more detailed examination into the exploitation of the worker, or the push and pull between the capitalist and the worker in the form of wages. Marx explains that &ldquo;the constant tendency of capital is to force the cost of labor back towards this absolute zero.&rdquo;</p><p>In the final section of this chapter Marx begins by reinforcing one of his foundational arguments: that capital is not actually &ldquo;a fixed magnitude, but &mldr; is elastic&rdquo; in that it &ldquo;constantly fluctuates with the division of surplus-value into revenue and additional capital.&rdquo; Contrary to this, the classical political economists viewed capital as &ldquo;a fixed magnitude.&rdquo; Marx makes a point to tear down the arguments of these classical political economists to strengthen the foundation for his theory of the exploited worker.</p><a href=#chapter-25-the-general-law-of-capitalist-accumulation><h3 id=chapter-25-the-general-law-of-capitalist-accumulation><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 25: The General Law of Capitalist Accumulation</h3></a><p>In the first section of Chapter 25 Marx proposes to examine the &ldquo;influence of the growth of capital on the fate of the working class.&rdquo; In order to do this it is necessary to have a better understanding of the composition of capital, as well as the &ldquo;changes [capital] undergoes in the course of the process of accumulation.&rdquo; Capital comprises &ldquo;value,&rdquo; which is the proportion of constant to variable capital, and &ldquo;material,&rdquo; or the ratio of means of production and labor-power. Assuming that this composition remains a constant, then the need for more labor and the fund for the workers&rsquo; wages must &ldquo;increase in the same proportion as the capital.&rdquo; As capital grows and is constantly reinvested, there comes a point where growth outstrips available labor, and this causes a rise in wages.</p><p>Section 2 moves past the example situation of capital growing while its composition stays constant. Marx investigates how changes in the technical composition of capital are bound to occur. As capital grows, there are also changes in the technical composition of capital: the &ldquo;mass of the means of production&rdquo; grows, while the labor-power doesn&rsquo;t. This creates a corresponding change in proportions of value-composition, as the constant capital grows &ldquo;at the expense of its variable constituent.&rdquo; Marx also introduces the concept of &ldquo;primitive accumulation&rdquo; in this section, which he states is the basis for modern capitalism. He investigates some further aspects of accumulation, noting that it increases &ldquo;concentration of the means of production, and of the command over labor&rdquo; while at the same time it works &ldquo;as repulsion of many individual capitals from one another.&rdquo;</p><p>Accumulation of capital is not only quantitative but is also equally qualitative, because its constant component changes &ldquo;at the expense of its variable component.&rdquo; The capitalist mode of production increases at a faster rate than accumulation of capital occurs. This happens for two reasons:</p><ol><li>because accumulation of capital experiences a &ldquo;centralization of its individual elements&rdquo; and</li><li>because the technical composition portion of the additional capital corresponds to changes in the &ldquo;technical composition of the original capital.&rdquo;</li></ol><p>Social capital is constantly growing and changing both externally and internally. It can grow for a while technically and attract &ldquo;additional labor-power in proportion to its increase,&rdquo; but &ldquo;at other times it undergoes organic change and reduces its variable component.&rdquo; The increase of labor-power creates what Marx calls a &ldquo;disposable industrial reserve army.&rdquo;</p><p>Marx identifies three types of surplus population: &ldquo;the floating, the latent, and the stagnant.&rdquo; The floating form encompasses the technical demand for labor and its constant shifting. The latent surplus population is the workers who begin in agriculture and move from the countryside to urban centers as capitalism takes over the agricultural industry. The stagnant type is the poorest type of laborer, who has irregular work for the lowest wages. In the final section of this chapter Marx examines different contexts for capitalist accumulation, primarily in 19th-century England.</p><a href=#analysis-13><h2 id=analysis-13><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p>In the beginning of Part 7 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Capital-Das-Kapital/author/ rel=noopener>Marx</a> introduces the concept of &ldquo;reproduction&rdquo; and reframes his early discussion about &ldquo;production&rdquo; in the context of &ldquo;reproduction,&rdquo; since it is part of a cyclical process. In Chapter 23 he illustrates how the worker in a capitalist system is caught up in this cycle, explaining that the worker receives &ldquo;in the shape of wages &mldr; a portion of the product he himself continuously reproduces.&rdquo; However, it&rsquo;s important to note that Marx sees the worker&rsquo;s part in this cycle as one of disadvantage. He argues that &ldquo;the worker always leaves the process in the same state as he entered it,&rdquo; but his continuation of that statement actually shows that the worker is in fact leaving the system worse off than when they entered it. Marx states that the worker leaves as &ldquo;a personal source of wealth, but deprived of any means of making that wealth a reality for himself.&rdquo; The main idea of this chapter is pretty well summed up in the final paragraph, which states that the overall process of capitalism &ldquo;produces and reproduces the capital-relation itself,&rdquo; which has two primary parts: &ldquo;on the one hand the capitalist, on the other the wage-laborer.&rdquo;</p><p>Chapter 24 primarily deals with an in-depth examination of capital and its relation to surplus-value. Surplus-value is initially embodied in the form of money, and it becomes capital when it is reinvested in labor and production. Marx points out the irony in the fact that &ldquo;additional workers are employed by means of the unpaid labor of the previously employed workers.&rdquo; The main point of this section is that in order for surplus-value to become capital, it must be invested as opposed to consumed. This system is made possible by the exploitation of workers. Marx makes a point to explain that though he disagrees with many of the major arguments of traditional political economists, he does agree with the traditional distinctions between unproductive workers, which are workers who create no new profit (such as a housemaid), and productive workers, who create products that make a profit.</p><p>In Section 4 of this chapter Marx digs into the issue of the wage struggle between capitalists and workers. He tries to drive home the fact that capitalists are always attempting to push the wage closer and closer to zero, while workers are pushing back for compensation that is fair and livable. In other words Marx illustrates here the fact of the exploitation of the worker. The final section of the chapter picks apart the arguments of political economists who over-simplify capital into something that is fixed and does not fluctuate. Marx understands that capital is more nuanced and elastic in nature. However, it was to the benefit of pro-capitalism economists to argue that it is a fixed thing, and therefore the struggle for higher wages is pointless because the &ldquo;labor fund&rdquo; is a fixed amount.</p><p>In the final chapter of Part 7 Marx looks at the trends of capitalism toward continual expansion. If the capitalist continues to make capital and reinvest it, making more capital off the original capital, this process of reproduction and accumulation are endless. And if capitalism keeps growing, this creates an ever-increasing need for workers. Marx indicates that this process also causes the price of labor and thus the wage to increase. It&rsquo;s important to note, however, that Marx still sees this type of wage increase as a pittance and not something that justifies the way workers are exploited. He argues that these wage increases still assume that &ldquo;the worker will always provide a certain quantity of unpaid labor.&rdquo; The process of capitalist expansion that creates more jobs and raises wages in small increments is still a form of enslavement and extortion of the working class, in Marx&rsquo;s theory.</p><p>The &ldquo;industrial reserve army&rdquo; mentioned in the title of the third section of Chapter 25 is in fact the workers in the capitalist system. Marx argues that the workers actually create &ldquo;the accumulation of capital and the means by which it is itself made relatively superfluous.&rdquo; What Marx calls a &ldquo;surplus population of workers,&rdquo; which results from the ever-increasing capitalist mode of accumulation, is also responsible in Marx&rsquo;s opinion for the continuation of the capitalist system. The system would fall apart if it didn&rsquo;t have a surplus pool of workers to constantly draw on as accumulation increases and increasing labor-power is required. The worker in this situation is &ldquo;disposable,&rdquo; as they can be replaced by any number of similarly abled workers. Marx creates three categories for these workers, all of whom exist in some degree of low-paid, relatively unstable condition of labor. He also describes the population that falls even &ldquo;lower&rdquo; than this stratum of workers, who are classified as various types of paupers. These paupers are often the raw material for becoming part of the &ldquo;industrial reserve army.&rdquo;</p><hr><a href=#vol-1-part-8-chapters-2633--so-called-primitive-accumulation--summary><h1 id=vol-1-part-8-chapters-2633--so-called-primitive-accumulation--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span> Vol. 1, Part 8, Chapters 26–33 : So-Called Primitive Accumulation | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-14><h2 id=summary-14><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><a href=#chapter-26-the-secret-of-primitive-accumulation><h3 id=chapter-26-the-secret-of-primitive-accumulation><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 26: The Secret of Primitive Accumulation</h3></a><p>Chapter 26 deals with the concept of &ldquo;primitive accumulation,&rdquo; a type of accumulation that happened before capitalist accumulation came into being. It is defined as &ldquo;an accumulation which is not the result of the capitalist mode of production but its point of departure.&rdquo; 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Capital-Das-Kapital/author/ rel=noopener>Marx</a> explains that historically, this type of accumulation typically happens by force—by conquest, robbery, the system of serfdom, and so on. Marx argues, &ldquo;The economic structure of capitalist society has grown out of the economic structure of feudal society.&rdquo; In the formation of a capitalist system, once a worker is freed from a system such as slavery or serfdom and becomes a free worker, that worker then turns around and sells himself (his labor) to the capitalist, entering another type of bondage as a wage-laborer.</p><a href=#chapter-27-the-expropriation-of-the-agricultural-population-from-the-land><h3 id=chapter-27-the-expropriation-of-the-agricultural-population-from-the-land><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 27: The Expropriation of the Agricultural Population from the Land</h3></a><p>Marx gives a basic account of the history of serfdom in England, showing how the expropriation of the peasants&rsquo; land over a period of a few hundred years created the groundwork for modern capitalism. Over this period huge masses of peasants and farmers were forced off their land in a variety of violent instances. Houses were destroyed or left to decay, and peasants were forced to flee and scatter in an attempt to start over. The British State eventually completely did away with the yeomanry, or independent peasants. They were replaced by &ldquo;small farmers on yearly leases, a servile rabble dependent on the arbitrary will of the landlords.&rdquo; Marx sees this as a &ldquo;systematic theft of communal property,&rdquo; and connects the English government with the creation of large &ldquo;capital&rdquo; farms.</p><a href=#chapter-28-bloody-legislation-against-the-expropriated-since-the-end-of-the-fifteenth-century-the-forcing-down-of-wages-by-act-of-parliament><h3 id=chapter-28-bloody-legislation-against-the-expropriated-since-the-end-of-the-fifteenth-century-the-forcing-down-of-wages-by-act-of-parliament><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 28: Bloody Legislation against the Expropriated since the End of the Fifteenth Century. The Forcing down of Wages by Act of Parliament</h3></a><p>In Chapter 28 Marx takes the reader through the succession of rulers who passed legislation to punish the displaced peasants, many of whom were forced from poverty to become thieves and beggars. As a result of this, the 16th century saw a &ldquo;bloody legislation against vagabondage &mldr; enforced throughout Western Europe.&rdquo; In 1530 Henry VIII instituted whipping, removal of an ear, and execution for able-bodied vagabonds. In 1547 Edward VI declared that any vagabond refusing work may be enslaved by the person to whom they refused the work. Under the reign of Elizabeth I in 1572 beggars and vagabonds were sentenced to flogging and, upon repeated offenses, execution. Whipping, imprisonment, and branding were punishments for anyone begging under the rule of James I until 1625. According to Marx, this expropriation and subsequently unjust treatment of the displaced agricultural population was the beginning of conditioning a capitalist workforce.</p><a href=#chapter-29-the-genesis-of-the-capitalist-farmer><h3 id=chapter-29-the-genesis-of-the-capitalist-farmer><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 29: The Genesis of the Capitalist Farmer</h3></a><p>In England the formation of the capitalist can be traced back in agriculture through a few different forms. The first form is that of the bailiff, who was also a serf, and who worked for some sort of overlord. Then they become farmers; were given seed, tools, and cattle; and still worked under some sort of overlord. In the third form the farmer began to employ many laborers and became a sharecropper. Finally, in the 15th century the sharecropper became a farmer in his own right, employing laborers and creating surplus-value. The &ldquo;usurpation of the common lands&rdquo; allowed the farmers to expand and gain more livestock, eventually leading to &ldquo;a class of capitalist farmers&rdquo; by the end of the 16th century.</p><a href=#chapter-30-impact-of-the-agricultural-revolution-on-industry-the-creation-of-a-home-market-for-industrial-capital><h3 id=chapter-30-impact-of-the-agricultural-revolution-on-industry-the-creation-of-a-home-market-for-industrial-capital><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 30: Impact of the Agricultural Revolution on Industry. The Creation of a Home Market for Industrial Capital</h3></a><p>Chapter 30 primarily focuses on the circumstance of the &ldquo;expropriation of the previously self-supporting peasants and their separation from their own means of production.&rdquo; As Marx has explained previously the conditions of the peasants worsened in England as time went on, until peasants who used to be able to work in their craft to support themselves were forced to work for others for longer hours and less money. Marx explains that members of the peasant class used to primarily barter for goods within their community, but with this shift to wage-labor a situation was created where the wage-laborers started purchasing most things at the market instead of bartering. In this way capitalism created its own market.</p><a href=#chapter-31-the-genesis-of-the-industrial-capitalist><h3 id=chapter-31-the-genesis-of-the-industrial-capitalist><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 31: The Genesis of the Industrial Capitalist</h3></a><p>Unlike the agrarian capitalist, the creation of the industrial capitalist was not a gradual process. Industrial capitalism formed quickly by utilizing money made from usurer and merchant capital. Seaport towns were an early site of manufacturing, as they were outside of the control of many guilds that would place restrictions on manufacturing labor. Marx argues that the wealth that allowed for the rise of industrial capitalism did not result from frugality but was taken by force. Much of the force he refers to is related to colonialism and the enslavement or indenture of indigenous people to amass wealth. Marx&rsquo;s examples here are not limited to English colonialism but also detail the horrors perpetrated by the Dutch and Spanish. The rise of industrial capitalism also correlates to the rise of national debt in most European countries.</p><a href=#chapter-32-the-historical-tendency-of-capitalist-accumulation><h3 id=chapter-32-the-historical-tendency-of-capitalist-accumulation><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 32: The Historical Tendency of Capitalist Accumulation</h3></a><p>Chapter 32 summarizes much of the information given in Part 8. In this chapter Marx recaps and outlines the movement from primitive accumulation to early capitalism. He also discusses the concept of private property and contrasts the traditional small-scale private property of the laborer or artisan with large-scale capitalist private property, which Marx argues is responsible for the destruction of smaller-scale private property. This chapter just begins to dip into a topic that is very important in much of Marx&rsquo;s other philosophical writings.</p><a href=#chapter-33-the-modern-theory-of-colonization><h3 id=chapter-33-the-modern-theory-of-colonization><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 33: The Modern Theory of Colonization</h3></a><p>In Chapter 33 Marx revisits the issue of colonization in the context of private property. He insists there are two different types of private property, the first of which &ldquo;rests on the labor of the producer himself&rdquo; and the second of which rests &ldquo;on the exploitation of the labor of others.&rdquo; In the colonies the capitalist uses force to get producers to provide their labor to the capitalist, instead of laboring for the producer&rsquo;s own enrichment. Marx introduces the theory of political economist E.G. Wakefield, who claims that England&rsquo;s goal is to manufacture &ldquo;wage-laborers in the colonies&rdquo; in a process called &ldquo;systematic colonization.&rdquo; In order to do this, public land is turned into private land, so that the colonists who might otherwise just live off the land and work for themselves must now work for a wage in order to eventually purchase and own the land they live on. In the course of his argument, Wakefield&rsquo;s own analysis admits that circumstances are actually better for people if they stay free producers rather than work for the capitalist system and wage-laborers. This in turn supports a point Marx has been trying to make all along.</p><a href=#analysis-14><h2 id=analysis-14><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p>Part 8 of <em>Capital</em> is organized as a series of perfunctory chapters which offer some extra information around 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Capital-Das-Kapital/author/ rel=noopener>Marx</a>&rsquo;s investigations into capitalism. A lot of the content in this section is of a historical and contextual nature and touches on the violent origins of the capitalist economic system. He entitles Part 8 &ldquo;So-Called Primitive Accumulation,&rdquo; which is presumably Marx&rsquo;s way of taking a stab at Adam Smith&rsquo;s argument of &ldquo;previous accumulation.&rdquo;</p><p>Chapters 26 and 27 examine the origins of the conditions that allow capitalism to arise and delve into the history of systems such as serfdom in England and Europe. Marx illuminates how the state plays a huge role in creating a working class that would become the fuel for capitalist labor. This working class, Marx explains in these chapters, was created by the expropriation of the land from the independent peasants, which took away their means of making a livelihood.</p><p>In Chapter 28 Marx gives a detailed account of the displacement and brutal mistreatment of agricultural peasants over the period that is described in Chapter 27. He describes the series of rulers and punishments that they prescribed for a group of people whose very situation was created by the state. In a searing remark Marx states that, in this period, &ldquo;agricultural folk [were] first forcibly expropriated from the soil, driven from their homes, [and] turned into vagabonds.&rdquo; After this process they were then &ldquo;whipped, branded and tortured by grotesquely terroristic laws&rdquo; which in turn created a whole demographic ready to &ldquo;accept the discipline necessary for the system of wage-labor.&rdquo;</p><p>Marx studies the creation of the capitalist in the context of historical England, but it is clear that the route to capitalism has differed from country to country, region to region. The history of capitalism in the United States, with its early dependence on slavery, is different from the way capitalism came into being in Great Britain. As a leading industrial nation in the 1800s, England is an easy target for Marx, though he too seems to hold that capitalism is a complex system that has developed differently under different conditions.</p><p>Marx saw colonialism as an evil that was the primary financing of industrial capitalism. The shipment of slaves overseas to colonies, or the enslavement or low-wage labor of indigenous people, as well as the theft of their land and resources, were the primary sources for the money that gave rise to British industrial capitalism. Marx paints a damning picture of colonialism (especially as it is justified through Christian morals of the time), which is particularly clear-sighted and vehement. Marx is very clearly anti-imperialist and anti-colonialism, seeing the parallels and worse between the English wage-laborer and the forced labor of indigenous people in the West Indies, Mexico, and other colonies. The final chapter of <em>Capital</em> actually continues to discuss the realities of colonization and its relation to capitalism, building on the insights given in Chapter 31. Ultimately, Part 8 of <em>Capital</em> is a brief examination into the history of the development of capitalism in Europe and particularly in England. It begins with pre-capitalist primitive accumulation and moves from the 15th to 19th centuries, detailing the political, historical, and economic premises for the development of modern day capitalism.</p><hr><a href=#quotes><h1 id=quotes><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span> Quotes</h1></a><ol><li></li></ol><p>Marx gives a very basic introductory definition of the commodity, which is one of the most important and foundational concepts in the text.</p><ol start=2><li></li></ol><blockquote><p>Every useful thing &mldr; may be looked at from the &mldr; points of view of quality and quantity. <em>Narrator,

In the 16th century peasants were forced from their land and homes and became beggars. The ruling powers that took their livelihoods from them then punished them horribly for being vagabonds. This, Marx argues, is the group who would become the working class, as they were already beaten down and poor.</p><hr><a href=#overview-of-volumes-2-and-3><h1 id=overview-of-volumes-2-and-3><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Overview of Volumes 2 and 3</h1></a><p>Only Volume 1 of <em>Capital</em> was completed by 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Capital-Das-Kapital/author/ rel=noopener>Marx</a> during his lifetime. Drawing on Marx&rsquo;s extensive notes, his friend and fellow socialist Friedrich Engels completed Volumes 2 and 3 after Marx&rsquo;s death. These volumes are much more economically technical than the previous volume.</p><a href=#volume-2-the-process-of-circulation-of-capital-1885><h2 id=volume-2-the-process-of-circulation-of-capital-1885><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Volume 2: The Process of Circulation of Capital (1885)</h2></a><p>In this second volume of <em>Capital</em>, Marx shifts from the production and labor-based focus of the first volume to a focus on the circulation of capital. Here, Marx investigates the relationship between the production described in the previous volume and what happens to capital in circulation.</p><p>The first part of Volume 2 is entitled &ldquo;The Metamorphoses of Capital and their Circuits.&rdquo; He organizes circulation into three primary circuits: money capital, productive capital, and commodity capital. The circuits are created by the cycle of labor-power, production, and the sale of the commodity. Both workers and capitalists have to buy commodities and feed the system, but they enter the market in two distinctly different classes. This circuit of capital reinforces Marx&rsquo;s earlier concept that capitalism is concerned with the exchange-value of what it produces—and not use-value. In the end of this part Marx examines the circuit as a whole and illustrates that these three separate circuits are actually all parts of the larger circuit of capital.</p><p>Part 2, called &ldquo;The Turnover of Capital,&rdquo; looks at the circulation of capital over time. The time required to complete the circuit is turnover. Different elements of the cycle move at different paces. For example, different commodities take different lengths of time to manufacture, and some commodities are consumed quickly while others remain in circulation for a longer duration. Additionally, capital must be distinguished as either &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; or &ldquo;circulating.&rdquo; Materials and labor-power make up circulating capital, while instruments of labor (i.e., machines) are fixed capital. This multitude of different elements affects the overall turnover of capital and thus the overall profit generated.</p><p>&ldquo;The Reproduction and Circulation of Aggregate Social Capital&rdquo; is the final part of this volume. Its focus is on the concept of &ldquo;aggregate capital&rdquo; of a society, as opposed to the capital of the individual capitalist. Aggregate social capital refers to the consideration of individual capitalists together as a whole. Within this combined social capital consumption is an important element. The capitalists not only consume the labor-power of the workers, they must also consume commodities themselves as well as buying machines and other methods of production from other capitalists. The workers themselves must purchase commodities created by capitalists for their daily living. Throughout this part Marx analyzes how individual capital and consumption is interconnected in the larger aggregate social capital.</p><a href=#volume-3-the-process-of-capitalist-production-as-a-whole-1894><h2 id=volume-3-the-process-of-capitalist-production-as-a-whole-1894><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Volume 3: The Process of Capitalist Production as a Whole (1894)</h2></a><p>Volume 3 is divided into seven parts and investigates more concrete interactions between individual capitals. The previous volumes focused on developing the overall capitalist system, addressing its process and evolution; in Volume 3 Marx strives to &ldquo;locate and describe the concrete forms which grow out of the movement of capital as a whole,&rdquo; meaning that his goal is to look at actual manifestations of various forms of capital.</p><p>The first two parts of the book develop the concept of profit. The cost price of profit takes Marx&rsquo;s earlier equation of <em>C</em> = (<em>c</em> + <em>v</em>) + <em>s</em> and tweaks it to give the cost price, so the new equation is <em>k</em> = <em>c</em> + <em>v</em>. The <em>k</em> in this equation is the cost price, and the <em>s</em>, or surplus-value, is removed because the capitalist does not pay for the surplus-value, only the production and labor. The <em>rate of profit</em> can be determined by the formula <em>s</em>/(<em>c</em> + <em>v</em>) and is always less than the rate of surplus-value. Moreover, the faster the rate of turnover, the higher the rate of profit. Rate of profit can also be increased by finding or making cheaper raw materials, machinery, and so on. In the following chapters Marx works to turn these foundational theories into an average rate of profit across different branches of capitalism.</p><p>The third part of the book is one of the more often discussed portions of Volume 3. Its main focus is the phenomenon of the falling profit. Marx argues that if surplus-value is taken as a constant, the rate of profit will fall in proportion with the rise of the organic composition of capital (which is how Marx refers to the value-composition, as explained in Volume 1). Rising wages is one way that composition may rise and thus profits will fall. In order to keep profits from falling and keep their surplus-value constant or increasing, capitalists continually seek to expand the market.</p><p>Marx examines merchants&rsquo; capital and the connection between profit and interest. He proposes that in separating interest-bearing capital from productive capital, it appears that the capital itself generates interest and profit comes to seem even further removed from the actual production. Marx introduces the trinity formula to illustrate how capital affects class and social relations: &ldquo;capital—interest, land—ground-rent, labor—wages.&rdquo; In this formula capital produces interest, land produces rent, and labor produces wages. Profit and wages are two forms of revenue. Profit and rent are parts of the surplus-value, while wages correspond to variable capital. Ultimately, Marx holds that there are three classes in this system: &ldquo;wage-laborers, capitalists, and land-owners.&rdquo; Each derives their revenue from the trinity equation above, meaning wages, interest, and rent, respectively.</p><hr><a href=#glossary><h1 id=glossary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Glossary</h1></a><p><strong>alienation:</strong> the process of separating workers from the fruits of their labor.

Marx was born May 5, 1818, to middle-class parents in Trier in what is now Germany, and received a private education before going to public high school. From there he attended the University of Bonn, where he studied humanities. He developed a personal interest in the works of the German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. He left after a year and began studying law and philosophy at the University of Berlin. In 1836 he became engaged to Jenny von Westphalen, whom he had known since childhood. She was a baroness who abandoned her aristocratic background to marry Marx. The two married after a seven-year engagement.</p><p>While at university Marx was attracted to various radical circles, including the Poets&rsquo; Club in Bonn and the Young Hegelians in Berlin, a group that embraced the radical and revolutionary aspects of Hegelian philosophy. Because of its radicalism, Marx&rsquo;s dissertation likely would not have been accepted at the University of Berlin, so Marx submitted it to the more permissive University of Jena, which granted him a doctorate in 1841. With the generally conservative atmosphere in Prussian Germany (parts of Prussia, Brandenberg, northern Germany, and western Poland), Marx could not find an academic position and so took up journalism after graduating, writing for the radical press and cultivating his ideas on economics and socialism, the theory that advocates government ownership of goods production and distribution.</p><a href=#journalism-and-exile><h3 id=journalism-and-exile><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Journalism and Exile</h3></a><p>Marx&rsquo;s writings got him into trouble, leading to exile that lasted until his death. He left for Paris in October 1843 to write for a new publication there. However, as he was adopting and developing the ideas he would put into &ldquo;The Communist Manifesto,&rdquo; he was banished from Paris for writings critical of the Prussian government. He moved to Brussels, where he wrote &ldquo;The Communist Manifesto&rdquo; for the Communist League. The document contains many ideas from the broader socialist movements—socialism, another left-wing school of thought that has commonalities with communism, also includes social reforms such as universal health care for the welfare of the people. &ldquo;The Communist Manifesto&rdquo; also included Marx&rsquo;s own insights, written for popular consumption, in their most condensed and approachable form.</p><p>Following the 1848 publication of &ldquo;The Communist Manifesto,&rdquo; Marx was buffeted by the tides then overtaking revolutionary Europe. In 1848 a series of revolutions in France, some German states, Austria, Italy, Denmark, and elsewhere convulsed continental Europe, in several instances leading to the construction of constitutional democracies. Influenced by these forces, Marx attempted to establish revolutionary newspapers. For his efforts he faced police harassment and prosecution, forcing him to flee from Brussels by 1849. At the time Marx arrived in London in 1850, there was an international hub of exiled revolutionaries from across Europe, and Marx involved himself in greater political activism and more serious study.</p><a href=#marx-and-revolution><h3 id=marx-and-revolution><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Marx and Revolution</h3></a><p>Marx&rsquo;s participation in the Communist League led to internal strife regarding tactics and strategy. Some group members wanted to precipitate a workers&rsquo; revolution through an action that would inspire people to revolt. Opposed to this action, Marx called it &ldquo;adventurism&rdquo; and forced a split in the group. Years later in the 1870s, this pattern would repeat itself in the International Workingmen&rsquo;s Association, a London-based federation of European worker organizations advancing socialism and communism. Also known as the First International, the organization had many internal differences of opinion, the biggest being the disagreement over the role of the state. Anti-state socialists converged around the figure of Russian revolutionary and anarchist Mikhail Bakunin, arguing that Marx&rsquo;s vision of a state-run workers&rsquo; society was foolish. More than a theoretical difference, this was a matter of practical import about whether to participate in bourgeois (middle-class) elections and proletariat (working-class) political parties as a pathway toward revolution. Marx forced a split in the organization, ousting the anti-statist members and moving its headquarters to New York, thereby contributing to the downfall of the group.</p><p>From 1850 to 1870 Marx wrote some of his most noteworthy works after &ldquo;The Communist Manifesto,&rdquo; including his history of the 1848 revolution in France, <em>The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte</em> (1852), and his 1867 masterwork, <em>Capital</em>, which offers a far-ranging critique of capitalism and solidified Marx&rsquo;s position as a major philosopher of the 19th century. In 1871 revolutions again broke out in Europe. In France the Paris Commune (the radical revolutionary government that ruled Paris from March to May of 1871, following the defeat of French ruler Napoleon III) and the struggle of the Communards —those who supported the commune—excited the hopes of revolutionaries worldwide. For Marx, as developed in his long pamphlet on the revolution, &ldquo;The Civil War in France&rdquo; (1871), the Paris Commune seemed to point a new way forward toward a potentially stateless version of worker democracy and class power. In the final decade of his life Marx worked on two subsequent volumes to <em>Capital</em>, which developed the insights framed in the first volume and sought to give his philosophical ideas greater rigor. The second two volumes of <em>Capital</em> remained unfinished at Marx&rsquo;s death and were compiled from his notes and published posthumously by Engels.</p><a href=#death-and-legacy><h3 id=death-and-legacy><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Death and Legacy</h3></a><p>In 1881 Marx&rsquo;s wife, Jenny, died of liver cancer. Soon after her death Marx took ill, suffering from inflammation of the lungs and chest before succumbing to bronchitis on March 14, 1883. He and Jenny are buried in London&rsquo;s Highgate Cemetery. The legacy of Marx&rsquo;s views and writings cannot be overstated, for they radically moved the course of 19th- and 20th-century history.</p><a href=#suggested-reading><h1 id=suggested-reading><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Suggested Reading</h1></a><p>Here are some suggested reading materials and online resources to help you get a better understanding of Karl Marx&rsquo;s <em>Capital (Das Kapital)</em>.
