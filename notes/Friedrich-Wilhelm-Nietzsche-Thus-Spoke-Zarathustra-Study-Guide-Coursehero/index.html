The character is, in part, based on the historical Iranian religious figure Zoroaster. The subtitle <em>A Book For All and None</em> indicates this book is for everyone, not just scholars. At the same time, American philosopher Leo Strauss suggests it is a profoundly private expression of Nietzsche&rsquo;s thoughts, &ldquo;which as such are not communicable to anyone else and certainly not applicable by everyone else.&rdquo;</p><hr><a href=#context><h1 id=context><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Context</h1></a><a href=#zoroastrianism><h2 id=zoroastrianism><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Zoroastrianism</h2></a><a href=#founder><h4 id=founder><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Founder</h4></a><p>The Iranian prophet Zoroaster (c. 628–551 BCE), who serves as the inspiration for the main character in <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra,</em> was also known as 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Thus-Spoke-Zarathustra/character-analysis/#Zarathustra rel=noopener>Zarathustra</a> (also spelled Zarathushtra). Over 3,500 years ago, he founded a monotheistic (related to belief in a single god) religion called Zoroastrianism. What is known of Zoroaster comes from the <em>Avesta</em> (sacred text of Zoroastrianism). A timeline of his life has been established based upon archaeological evidence and linguistic comparisons with the <em>Rigveda</em> (oldest of the sacred Hindu texts).</p><p>According to the <em>Gathas</em> (first section of the <em>Avesta</em>), the prophet was married and produced six children: three sons and three daughters. He was opposed to the sacrifice of animals, polytheism (belief in many gods), and the oppressive class structure of his time. He also opposed the use of hallucinogens for rituals. When he was 30, the prophet had a vision and decided to teach it. However, the prophet&rsquo;s ideas were upsetting to local authorities, and he gathered no followers. After 12 unsuccessful years as a local prophet, he traveled to another country and found a king and queen who embraced his revolutionary teachings.</p><a href=#belief-system><h4 id=belief-system><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Belief System</h4></a><p>By 2006 Zoroastrianism reputedly had less than 190,000 followers. However, Zoroastrianism, which was the official faith of Persia (modern-day Iran) from 600 BCE to 650 CE, was once was among the most powerful religions globally.</p><p>Zoroastrians believe in the god Ahura Mazdā, who created the world. Zoroastrianism is dualistic in nature, meaning there are two opposing forces or principles. The opposing entity to Ahura Mazdā is called Angra Mainyu, a destroying spirit that is sometimes recognized as an allegory for the evil in humanity. Practitioners pray numerous times a day, and their place of worship is called a Fire Temple (or <em>Agiary</em>). The temple contains a sacred fire, which is never extinguished. The fire is a symbol of the divine light of Ahura Mazdā. The recommended spiritual path is based on the mantra &ldquo;Good Thoughts, Good Words, Good Deeds.&rdquo; As they follow this path, Zoroastrians choose how they will worship and pray.</p><p>The sacred text of Zoroastrianism is called the <em>Avesta.</em> Within the text are two sections, the first of which includes the <em>Gathas</em> (17 hymns believed to have been written by the prophet Zoroaster). The second section includes both myths and information about rituals. One significant ritual of the faith is the <em>Navjote.</em> This initiation prayer ceremony is completed between the ages of 7 and 12 when a child receives the sacred garments of a <em>sudreh</em> (shirt) and a <em>kusti</em> (cord). Overall, however, the faith is centered on seasonal festivals and prayer. Some of the faithful wear a cord (a <em>kusti</em>) that is knotted three times. These three knots are reminders of the &ldquo;Good Thoughts, Good Words, Good Deeds&rdquo; mantra.</p><a href=#comparison-to-christianity><h4 id=comparison-to-christianity><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Comparison to Christianity</h4></a><p>Zoroastrianism predates Christianity, although many of the elements of the Christian faith are visible within Zoroastrianism. Similarities include the concepts of heaven and hell, as well as the monotheistic and dualistic natures of Judaism and Christianity. Also, while the prophet Zoroaster was the founder of the faith, he was not viewed as God.</p><p>Like Christianity, Zoroastrianism incorporates free will: people have the choice to either follow good or evil paths. The good is called <em>asha,</em> which is &ldquo;truth.&rdquo; The evil is <em>druj,</em> which is &ldquo;deceit.&rdquo; In the afterlife a person will either go to heaven (Ahura Mazdā&rsquo;s realm) or hell (Angra Mainyu&rsquo;s realm).</p><p>In 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Thus-Spoke-Zarathustra/author/ rel=noopener>Nietzsche</a>&lsquo;s <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra,</em> the fictional character is doubted, as was the historical prophet. Also, the character in Nietzsche&rsquo;s book implores his listeners to refuse the system that oppresses or limits them—as Zoroaster did when he rejected the class-based social system of his time.</p><a href=#nietzsches-philosophical-terminology><h2 id=nietzsches-philosophical-terminology><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Nietzsche&rsquo;s Philosophical Terminology</h2></a><p>In <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra,</em> Nietzsche introduces a number of important terms:</p><ul><li><strong>Eternal recurrence or return:</strong> belief that time—past, present, and future—is infinite. Therefore, events must recur or repeat throughout time. This theory supports the idea that time and therefore life is in a constant state of change. There are no fixed moments or states of being. If one achieves the status of overman or superman, this state becomes permanent in its recurrence.</li><li><strong>Nihilism:</strong> belief in nothing. In such a world, life is meaningless. Nietzsche worried that disappearing historical human purposes for living, such as religion, needed to be replaced with other purposes, such as achieving the status of overman or superman, in order to avoid chaos.</li><li><strong>Overcoming:</strong> ability to change the self by overcoming attachments to false authorities such as law, prejudice, or religion to develop one&rsquo;s own values.</li><li><strong>Overman or superman:</strong> superior being and the goal of humanity. The overman or superman frees himself from false attachments to self-create according to his own experience of the world.</li><li><strong>Will to power:</strong> driving force of humanity. Humans are driven to free themselves from false attachments to achieve self-mastery. The reward for such achievement is absolute freedom and power.</li></ul><hr><a href=#characters><h1 id=characters><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Characters</h1></a><table><thead><tr><th>Character</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Zarathustra</td><td>Zarathustra, the only main character in the book, serves as Nietzsche&rsquo;s alter ego in the exploration of his philosophy. 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Thus-Spoke-Zarathustra/character-analysis/#Zarathustra rel=noopener>Read More</a></td></tr><tr><td>Wanderer/Shadow</td><td>The wanderer/shadow appears from time to time along Zarathustra&rsquo;s journey and is one of his guests. 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Thus-Spoke-Zarathustra/character-analysis/#Wanderer/Shadow rel=noopener>Read More</a></td></tr><tr><td>Youth</td><td>The youth meets Zarathustra and follows him as one of his disciples in Chapter 8: On the Tree of the Mountainside. 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Thus-Spoke-Zarathustra/character-analysis/#Youth rel=noopener>Read More</a></td></tr><tr><td>Adder</td><td>The adder appears in Chapter 19: On the Adder&rsquo;s Bite as it unsuccessfully attempts to lethally poison Zarathustra. The episode with this creature illustrates Zarathustra&rsquo;s instruction to not requite an enemy&rsquo;s evil with enmity, but rather prove to an enemy that he has done some good.</td></tr><tr><td>Ass</td><td>The ass is worshipped by Zarathustra&rsquo;s guests in Chapter 78, The Ass Festival in something of a parody of the biblical event when Moses came down from the mount with his tablets of law to find the Israelites worshipping a golden calf. The ass is first encountered bearing the packages of the two kings and unlike Zarathustra&rsquo;s companion animals, it does not speak.</td></tr><tr><td>Conscientious man</td><td>The conscientious man is recognized by Zarathustra as a &ldquo;higher man&rdquo; and becomes one of Zarathustra&rsquo;s guests. Zarathustra must overcome his pity for the conscientious man as his last test before his spirit can transform from the lion into the child at the end of the book.</td></tr><tr><td>Dancing girls</td><td>The dancing girls meet Zarathustra on his journey. The dancing girls, who express the freedom of movement in a pastoral setting, represent the joyful release from religious inhibitions and body-guilt.</td></tr><tr><td>Disciples</td><td>The disciples, also referred to as &ldquo;brothers,&rdquo; follow Zarathustra for part of his journey and listen to his discourses. Most of what Zarathustra has to say throughout is addressed to them in each of the chapters of the book, but when they attempt to revere him, he sends them away to find their own truths and transformations.</td></tr><tr><td>Eagle</td><td>The eagle is one of Zarathustra&rsquo;s two animal companions who stays with him throughout his journey. As a creature of the sky, the eagle soars above the earth-walking man, offering words of wise foresight.</td></tr><tr><td>Fool</td><td>The fool, also known as &ldquo;Zarathustra&rsquo;s ape,&rdquo; mimics Zarathustra&rsquo;s words and appearance. He is confronted directly by Zarathustra in Chapter 51: On Passing By. This character serves as an example of how something that appears to be the truth may actually be an illusion.</td></tr><tr><td>Jester</td><td>The jester ridicules and jumps over the tightrope walker in an episode of Zarathustra&rsquo;s Prologue. This character is the mocking voice of self-criticism in the potential &ldquo;higher man&rdquo; of the tightrope walker.</td></tr><tr><td>King at the left</td><td>The king at the left is one of Zarathustra&rsquo;s guests, who makes his appearance in Chapter 63: Conversation with the Kings. His is a conservative and quiet voice.</td></tr><tr><td>King at the right</td><td>The king at the right is one of Zarathustra&rsquo;s guests found wandering with the ass and the king at the left in Chapter 63: Conversation with the Kings. He is more outspoken than the king at the left.</td></tr><tr><td>Little old woman</td><td>The little old woman appears in Chapter 18: On Little Old and Young Women to ask Zarathustra to address the issues of women. She represents a sounding board for the author&rsquo;s ideas about women in general.</td></tr><tr><td>Magician</td><td>The magician is one of Zarathustra&rsquo;s guests, invited to Zarathustra&rsquo;s cave in Chapter 65: The Magician. As a &ldquo;higher man,&rdquo; the magician is frank and honest about his craft of illusion which common folk take as powerful magic.</td></tr><tr><td>Pope</td><td>The elderly retired pope has killed God and is one of Zarathustra&rsquo;s guests first encountered in Chapter 66: Retired. Since the purpose of this character to rouse the religious is no longer relevant, he has an opportunity to reinvent himself.</td></tr><tr><td>Sage</td><td>The sage is one of Zarathustra&rsquo;s guests who first appears in Chapter 2: On the Teachers of Virtue. His is a soothing voice to his listeners on the virtue of sleep so that morality can be defined as a passive, rather than active principle.</td></tr><tr><td>Saint/old man</td><td>The saint/old man meets Zarathustra on his journey in Zarathustra&rsquo;s Prologue. His is the voice of cynicism on human nature, and he warns Zarathustra that the town toward which he is heading is filled with men hostile to hermits.</td></tr><tr><td>Seamen</td><td>The seamen spend time with Zarathustra aboard a ship in an earlier chapter, but it is in Chapter 40: On Great Event they first report having seen Zarathustra flying in the sky. These honest laborers are hailed by Zarathustra as fellow travelers who endure discomfort and risk on the open seas, but he does not attempt to teach them as he does his disciples.</td></tr><tr><td>Serpent</td><td>The serpent is one of Zarathustra&rsquo;s animal companions who travel with him on his journeys. As the opposite of the eagle, the serpent is possessed of the wisdom of the earth.</td></tr><tr><td>Soothsayer</td><td>The soothsayer appears at different points along Zarathustra&rsquo;s journey, notably in Chapter 41: The Soothsayer and Chapter 62: The Cry of Distress. This character is thought by Zarathustra to be a &ldquo;higher man&rdquo; because he lives largely outside social norms, but his dismal pronouncements of foreboding are unrelenting, leaving him behind in joy and humor.</td></tr><tr><td>Tightrope walker</td><td>The tightrope walker dies and is carried by Zarathustra to be buried in Zarathustra&rsquo;s Prologue. This character might have become a higher man had he lived to transition spiritually from the camel to the lion stage. Even so, Zarathustra honors the life of risk the tightrope walker led.</td></tr><tr><td>Ugliest man</td><td>The ugliest man is one of Zarathustra&rsquo;s guests when Zarathustra finds him in Chapter 67: The Ugliest Man. Shunned by society due to his horrific appearance, this character nevertheless embraces his condition as who he truly is, and so is hailed as a &ldquo;higher man&rdquo; eligible to become an &ldquo;overman.&rdquo; But because he is defined by his appearance, this man is unable to evolve.</td></tr><tr><td>Voluntary beggar</td><td>The voluntary beggar is one of Zarathustra&rsquo;s guests. He is discovered by Zarathustra in Chapter 68: The Voluntary Beggar.</td></tr></tbody></table><hr><a href=#character-analysis><h1 id=character-analysis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Character Analysis</h1></a><a href=#zarathustra><h2 id=zarathustra><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Zarathustra</h2></a><p>Like Nietzsche, Zarathustra suffers many physical ills and is accustomed to physical and mental hardship. He goes back and forth between spending time in the company of other people and in solitude. Despite a serious intent—he speaks a good deal more than he listens—Zarathustra is not without a sense of humor. The goal of his journey throughout the book is to find the &ldquo;overman&rdquo; so he can live in the future of his &ldquo;children.&rdquo; He describes himself as &ldquo;a seer, a willer, a creator, a future himself and a bridge to the future &mldr; a cripple at this bridge.&rdquo;</p><a href=#wanderershadow><h2 id=wanderershadow><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Wanderer/Shadow</h2></a><p>The wanderer/shadow is identified in Chapter 69: The Shadow.

<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Thus-Spoke-Zarathustra/character-analysis/#Zarathustra rel=noopener>Zarathustra</a> has become tired of his wisdom and is determined to &ldquo;go under,&rdquo; or reenter the world of men. Having declared &ldquo;God is dead,&rdquo; Zarathustra enters a town but his first speech to the people is interrupted when a tightrope walker falls to his death. Zarathustra carries the corpse to bury it and is joined by his animals—an eagle and a serpent—as he continues his journey.</p><a href=#part-1-chapters-110><h3 id=part-1-chapters-110><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 1, Chapters 1–10</h3></a><p>This grouping of speeches made by Zarathustra begins with a description of how the spirit makes three distinct transformations to generate its own mastery. Zarathustra arrives in the town of The Motley Cow and listens to the lectures of a sage before beginning his own discourses to a group of young men he addresses as his &ldquo;brothers.&rdquo; Zarathustra first talks about the body, guilt, and justice, then about states of mind before hailing his listeners as warriors.</p><a href=#part-1-chapters-1122><h3 id=part-1-chapters-1122><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 1, Chapters 11–22</h3></a><p>Zarathustra tells his listeners opposition to self-mastery lies before them and outlines the characteristics and tactics of each form of opposition. Some distractors, such as pity or friendship, arise from within. Others, such as the political state or women, come from external sources to play upon a desire for survival, comfort, or relief from loneliness.</p><a href=#part-2-chapters-2332><h3 id=part-2-chapters-2332><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 2, Chapters 23–32</h3></a><p>Zarathustra withdraws from the world of men to his mountain cave, expressing a wish that his &ldquo;wild&rdquo; wisdom could be delivered more gently. He nevertheless continues to speak to his disciples on the topic of covert evils resident in what appear to be virtues like pity for &ldquo;the all-too-human,&rdquo; religious faith, education, or the revenge of justice. Zarathustra acknowledges that removing these habits is painful in the extreme, although he promises new and better ones leading to the creation of the future &ldquo;overman&rdquo; will take their places.</p><a href=#part-2-chapters-3344><h3 id=part-2-chapters-3344><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 2, Chapters 33–44</h3></a><p>This section continues the line of reasoning Zarathustra has established in his talks with his disciples in the previous chapters. He notes that looking back into the past has made him physically sick, but the remedy can&rsquo;t be found in worldly fame, power, knowledge, or the arts. He describes the process of overcoming the self as a continuous one, and how its crippling discomfort leads to a palliative redemption from within.</p><a href=#part-3-chapters-4552><h3 id=part-3-chapters-4552><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 3, Chapters 45–52</h3></a><p>Zarathustra takes a hike over mountains on his way to the sea and contemplates how the height of a mountain is manifest only by the abyss below. From this concept of physical opposites, he recognizes a reversal of direction in his internal journey. He boards a ship but answers none of the questions posed by the seamen.</p><a href=#part-3-chapters-5360><h3 id=part-3-chapters-5360><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 3, Chapters 53–60</h3></a><p>After an unspecified period of time, Zarathustra returns home and continues his discourses to his disciples on oppositions such as lightness and gravity. One morning, he leaps up as if an unknown evil has slept with him, before falling as if dead for seven days. His animals bring him food, and he is refreshed enough to explain an experience of rebirth—which he terms &ldquo;eternal recurrence.&rdquo;</p><a href=#part-4-chapters-6170><h3 id=part-4-chapters-6170><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 4, Chapters 61–70</h3></a><p>Many years have passed, and Zarathustra is confronted by his animals, who ask him to climb up a mountain so he can see with clarity.

They share a meal together and Zarathustra takes an evening stroll. When he returns to his cave, he finds everyone worshipping the ass in a festival. The next morning, Zarathustra leaves his sleeping guests and realizes he has felt pity for them. Shaking off this last test, he looks forward to the last transformation of his spirit into the child.</p><hr><a href=#part-1-zarathustras-prologue--summary><h1 id=part-1-zarathustras-prologue--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 1, Zarathustra&rsquo;s Prologue | Summary</h1></a><p>Nietzsche breaks <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em> into four parts. This study guide breaks those parts further into chapter groupings.</p><a href=#summary-1><h2 id=summary-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Thus-Spoke-Zarathustra/character-analysis/#Zarathustra rel=noopener>Zarathustra</a>&rsquo;s Prologue includes 10 short segments in which Zarathustra, age 30, leaves his home to live in a cave in the mountains for 10 years. One morning, he greets the sun and feels the need to empty himself of the honey of his accumulated wisdom, saying &ldquo;I would give away and distribute, until the wise among men find joy once again in their folly, and the poor in their riches.&rdquo;</p><p>On his way down the mountainside, Zarathustra meets a saint/old man who warns him the townsfolk are suspicious of hermits. Zarathustra arrives in the marketplace and begins speaking of the &ldquo;overman,&rdquo; saying, &ldquo;What can be loved in man is that he is an <em>overture</em> and a <em>going under.</em>&rdquo; However, he is interrupted by the performance of a tightrope walker. Midway through the performance, a mocking jester walks along the rope from behind and leaps over the tightrope walker. The walker voluntarily throws away his pole and falls to his death, landing in front of Zarathustra. The dying man tells Zarathustra, &ldquo;I lose nothing when I lose my life. I am not much more than a beast that has been taught to dance by blows and a few meager morsels.&rdquo; Zarathustra carries the dead body and hides it in a hollow tree to protect it from wolves. The next morning, he is joined by his eagle and serpent as he continues on his journey.</p><a href=#analysis><h2 id=analysis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p>The collection of 10 short episodes in &ldquo;
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Thus-Spoke-Zarathustra/character-analysis/#Zarathustra rel=noopener>Zarathustra</a>&rsquo;s Prologue&rdquo; serves to set the tone for both the story and 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Thus-Spoke-Zarathustra/author/ rel=noopener>Nietzsche</a>&rsquo;s philosophical explorations into overcoming the self, religion, and relationships within the body and the spirit. Zarathustra&rsquo;s passage out of solitude so that he can interact with others is not only a physical journey, but also a spiritual progression. His encounter with the saint/old man along the way is the first of many in which other characters serve as contrasting internal voices for both Zarathustra and Nietzsche. In this instance, the saint/old man questions Zarathustra&rsquo;s interest in the town nearby, where the townsfolk mistrust wandering hermits and are therefore unlikely to listen to him. In a sense, this warning also reflects Nietzsche&rsquo;s purpose in writing the book, suggesting that even as he writes it, he does so in spite of the fact he believes hardly anyone reading it will understand.</p><p>The &ldquo;honey&rdquo; Zarathustra has accumulated over 10 years of solitude is the wisdom he wishes to impart to others. Honey is also bait to draw the &ldquo;higher men&rdquo; to be his guests in his cave beginning in Chapter 61: The Honey Sacrifice, but while it is &ldquo;sticky&rdquo; to get people to listen to him, Zarathustra also finds it &ldquo;sticky&rdquo; to overcome his own vanity, pride, and especially pity.</p><p>The statement regarding the wise finding joy in their folly and the poor in their riches is among the first of many Zarathustra makes throughout the book that present pairs of opposites for the purpose of illumination. For example, Zarathustra&rsquo;s pronouncement of a &ldquo;going under&rdquo; as a means by which the seeker is enabled to &ldquo;overcome&rdquo; the self is a reversal of orientation that recurs in later chapters. The character of Zarathustra is loosely based on Zoroaster, the middle-eastern founder of one of the world&rsquo;s oldest religions, Zoroastrianism. Zoroaster (Greek for Zarathustra) believed in a single deity (monotheism) and drew distinctions between the opposites of good and evil. These ideas are believed to have influenced the development of Judaism. The implication is that the quality of light is defined by the quality of darkness and vice versa. Thus, the act of creation becomes not so much a matter of bringing something into reality as it is of defining a division between what a thing is and what it is not. This becomes important later in <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em> when Zarathustra attacks the dragon&rsquo;s scales as a series of &ldquo;Thou shalt&rdquo; assumptions.</p><p>Two references in Zarathustra&rsquo;s Prologue connect <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em> to the works of German composer Richard Strauss (1864–1949). Strauss wrote an 1896 orchestral concerto titled <em>Also sprach Zarathustra,</em> in which the <em>Encyclopædia Britannica</em> claims &ldquo;the entities of man and nature are illustrated and contrasted by opposing tonalities.&rdquo; This music was used in the 1968 movie <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>.</p><p>The second connection is that both Strauss and Nietzsche made use of the mocking jester, a familiar folk character in German literature who sows chaos. The <em>Encyclopædia Britannica</em> asserts that &ldquo;Strauss found the exact instrumental sounds and colors to depict the 14th-century rogue &mldr; mocking the clergy to his death-squawk on a D clarinet on the gallows&rdquo; in his musical poem, <em>Till Eulenspiegel&rsquo;s Merry Pranks</em> (1894–95). The name &ldquo;Eulenspiegel&rdquo; means &ldquo;Owlglass,&rdquo; and the character is likely based on a historical person. The prankster of many cultures offers release from the strictures of ordered community life. In this instance, &ldquo;the stupid yet cunning peasant demonstrates his superiority to the narrow, dishonest, condescending townsman, as well as to the clergy and the nobility.&rdquo; The episode of the jester and the tightrope walker presents a literal example of Nietzsche&rsquo;s idea of self-release from social and religious restrictions even at the risk of &ldquo;falling off the tightrope.&rdquo;</p><p>The dying tightrope walker&rsquo;s statement about having not been much more than a beast is later reflected in Zarathustra&rsquo;s observation in Chapter 1: On the Three Metamorphoses that the first stage of the spirit is one of a camel carrying burdens across a desert. Had the tightrope walker not allowed himself to fall to his death, he might have been capable of moving to the next transformation of the spirit. It is this loss that moves Zarathustra to honor the tightrope walker.</p><p>Zarathustra&rsquo;s two animal companions who remain with him throughout the book are well-chosen opposites. While the eagle soars high above to symbolize aspiration and ideals, the serpent is a creature of the ground, significantly shedding its skin in a kind of rebirth. Together, these two creatures serve to keep Zarathustra focused on his goal when he becomes sidetracked by events that take place around him as he travels.</p><hr><a href=#part-1-chapters-110--summary><h1 id=part-1-chapters-110--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 1, Chapters 1–10 | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-2><h2 id=summary-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><a href=#chapter-1-on-the-three-metamorphoses><h3 id=chapter-1-on-the-three-metamorphoses><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 1: On the Three Metamorphoses</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Thus-Spoke-Zarathustra/character-analysis/#Zarathustra rel=noopener>Zarathustra</a> says there are three metamorphoses of the spirit leading to the &ldquo;overman.&rdquo; The spirit first becomes a camel, then a lion, and then a child.

<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Thus-Spoke-Zarathustra/character-analysis/#Zarathustra rel=noopener>Zarathustra</a> addresses the group of young disciples/brothers who elect to follow him. Thus the chapters illustrate the distribution of &ldquo;honey&rdquo; referenced in the Prologue. He begins by defining the three stages of human spiritual transformation: the camel stage, or the bearing of burdens; the lion stage, or battle with the dragon; and the innocent and pure child stage, where the spirit has no preconceptions, biases, guilt, or agendas. In this section, Zarathustra establishes a pattern where he speaks to himself as much as to his disciples, by rearranging popular pairs of opposites. Zarathustra continuously urges his disciples to undertake their own battles with these opposites.</p><p>The name of the town—The Motley Cow—is both deliberate and confusing. It may be a biblical reference to the ongoing struggle of wits between Jacob and Laban in Genesis 30:25-36. As the story indicates, mottled and black herd animals were less desirable than white ones because their wool or pelts would not take dye colors for the making of garments and rugs. Given this idea, The Motley Cow may refer to the haphazard collection of its inhabitants who have been rejected as inferior. The word motley means &ldquo;variegated in color&rdquo; and &ldquo;made up of many different people or things.&rdquo; The idea recurs later in the book, notably when Zarathustra berates citizens who have painted their faces different colors to disguise their true natures in Chapter 36: On the Land of Education.</p><p>Zarathustra&rsquo;s speeches include many references to the state of the body and an attachment to suffering, such as those in Chapter 2: On the Teachers of Virtue. This theme is intimately connected to 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Thus-Spoke-Zarathustra/author/ rel=noopener>Nietzsche</a>&rsquo;s personal battle with chronic illness throughout his life. Princeton professor of philosophy Walter A. Kaufmann, a well-established expert on Nietzsche, cites the source of this theme in Nietzsche&rsquo;s life in his background notes to <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra.</em> Additionally, according to Stefan Zweig&rsquo;s essay on this facet of Nietzsche&rsquo;s writings, Nietzsche was in constant physical pain such that his own body was a battlefield. Zweig notes, &ldquo;No devilish torture is lacking &mldr; headaches &mldr; which knock out the reeling Nietzsche for days &mldr; stomach cramps &mldr; his &rsquo;three-quarters blind eyes.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Chapter 9: On the Preachers of Death presents an awareness of a living presence in opposition to a dead or static state. Zarathustra here contrasts a physical cessation of life with a spiritual one deliberately sought by the preachers of death to attain an eternal afterlife free of all struggle and pain. The discussion indirectly refutes any religious promises that people who suffer in life can put their faith in a savior who will take away all pain after death. The idea &ldquo;ripens&rdquo; later in the book, notably in Chapter 59: The Other Dance Song when Zarathustra whispers into the ear of life—personified as his feminine dancing partner—that he knows he will recur over and over again eternally by embracing a living state of perpetual change. The idea embraces the motif that a physically embodied being is in constant, moment-by-moment adjustment to alterations. In other words, continuity of existence is possible only if the spirit is conjoined with the body in an active, rather than passively separated (death), relationship.</p><hr><a href=#part-1-chapters-1122--summary><h1 id=part-1-chapters-1122--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 1, Chapters 11–22 | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-3><h2 id=summary-3><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><a href=#chapter-11-on-the-new-idol><h3 id=chapter-11-on-the-new-idol><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 11: On the New Idol</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Thus-Spoke-Zarathustra/character-analysis/#Zarathustra rel=noopener>Zarathustra</a> says there are still &ldquo;peoples and herds&rdquo; elsewhere, but &ldquo;not where we live, my brothers: here there are states.&rdquo; He adds, &ldquo;State is the name of the coldest of all cold monsters&rdquo; and claims the state has created &ldquo;its own language of customs and rights.&rdquo;</p><a href=#chapter-12-on-the-flies-of-the-marketplace><h3 id=chapter-12-on-the-flies-of-the-marketplace><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 12: On the Flies of the Marketplace</h3></a><p>Zarathustra speaks of the marketplace where the &ldquo;noise of the great actors and the buzzing of the poisonous flies begins.&rdquo; He speaks of actors, showmen, and the innumerable &ldquo;small miserable creatures.&rdquo; He goes on to explain these &ldquo;small creatures&rdquo; grow mute &ldquo;when [a person] stepped among them&rdquo; and their strength &ldquo;went from them like smoke from a dying fire.&rdquo;</p><a href=#chapter-13-on-chastity><h3 id=chapter-13-on-chastity><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 13: On Chastity</h3></a><p>Zarathustra says it is &ldquo;better to fall into the hands of a murderer than into the dreams of a woman in heat.&rdquo; He also recommends against chastity for those for whom it is difficult &ldquo;lest it become their road to hell—the mud and the heat of their souls.&rdquo; A virtue to one person may be a path to hell for another.</p><a href=#chapter-14-on-the-friend><h3 id=chapter-14-on-the-friend><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 14: On the Friend</h3></a><p>Zarathustra claims if &ldquo;one wants to have a friend one must &mldr; want to wage war for him &mldr; to wage war one must be capable of being an enemy.&rdquo; This section goes into varying thoughts on the nature of a friend.

<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Thus-Spoke-Zarathustra/character-analysis/#Zarathustra rel=noopener>Zarathustra</a>&rsquo;s speeches to his disciples/brothers continue as they travel together, the section concludes with separation. Zarathustra sends his disciples/brothers away from him the moment they begin to focus on Zarathustra as a master rather than upon their individual solitary journeys toward the overman. Another distinction, or separation that has, up until this section of chapters, been implied is between men and women. The implication here is that the quintessential human being capable of undergoing the metamorphosis of the spirit from camel to lion to child is male, because women are inferior and subject to the will of man.</p><p>The language of the state of customs and rights is a clear starting point from which to attack the dragon&rsquo;s scales of &ldquo;Thou shalt.&rdquo; This action supports a list of corresponding &ldquo;Thou shalt not&rdquo; rules (such as those of the biblical tablets of Moses). Such an attack is the task of the spirit that has transformed into the lion, supporting the implication that Zarathustra inhabits this second metamorphosis of the spirit. Thus, it follows that in the final chapter he has finished this level as he anticipates the arrival of the child. In Chapter 11: On the New Idol, Zarathustra addresses the idea of the state outright as Kaufmann says in his notes, giving voice to 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Thus-Spoke-Zarathustra/author/ rel=noopener>Nietzsche</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;vehement denunciation of the state and of war in the literal sense. &mldr; In Nietzsche&rsquo;s own phrase: antipolitical.&rdquo; This is not only sweepingly applied to secular authority, but also to sacred authority supported in a formal religious doctrine.</p><p>Given his unsatisfactory relationships with women and his very narrow romantic connections with them, Nietzsche came to believe that women were either tyrants or slaves. In Chapter 14: On the Friend, Zarathustra speaks the author&rsquo;s opinion, which refers to &ldquo;the Greek conception of friendship&rdquo; as something only possible between men. Yet, Nietzsche depended upon his sister Elisabeth, who also took charge of the publications of his works, in his day-to-day struggles with ill-health, most notably in the last 11 years of his life.</p><p>The whip recommended to Zarathustra by the old woman in Chapter 18: On Little Old and Young Women reflects a general mistrust of women. Kaufmann notes in his discussion of this section of <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em> that although the old woman agrees with Zarathustra&rsquo;s estimation of the purpose of women, her agreement is necessarily limited by Nietzsche&rsquo;s scant understanding. Kaufmann acknowledges that &ldquo;his remarks about women are surely, more often than not, second-hand and third-rate.&rdquo; In any case, a woman with a mind of her own was a threat and danger to herself and society. The whip is also a reference to Salomé, who posed for a photograph arranged by Nietzsche with him and another friend, Paul Rée. She was seated in a cart drawn by the men and wielded a flowered whip. Salomé ultimately rejected Nietzsche and left with Rée. Kaufmann notes in his biography of Nietzsche&rsquo;s life that the loss of the intelligent and well-educated Salomé as an intellectual sounding board was followed by &ldquo;his [Nietzsche&rsquo;s] first attempt to put down his philosophy—not merely sundry observations—in one major work: <em>Zarathustra</em>.&rdquo; The frustratingly elusive and amorphous &ldquo;feminine&rdquo; element is made humanly physical only in the old woman (who speaks) and the group of dancing girls (who do not speak, but dance and sing).</p><hr><a href=#part-2-chapters-2332--summary><h1 id=part-2-chapters-2332--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 2, Chapters 23–32 | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-4><h2 id=summary-4><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><a href=#chapter-23-the-child-with-the-mirror><h3 id=chapter-23-the-child-with-the-mirror><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 23: The Child with the Mirror</h3></a><p>Part 2 begins with

He tells his listeners he is sorry to disappoint them but states there is no payback for being virtuous and doesn&rsquo;t even believe &ldquo;virtue is its own reward.&rdquo; Zarathustra also outlines several external motivations to virtue, such as fear of &ldquo;the scourge,&rdquo; laziness, and desire—specifically a desire for justice that can grow so large &ldquo;till the world is drowned in their injustice.&rdquo;</p><a href=#chapter-28-on-the-rabble><h3 id=chapter-28-on-the-rabble><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 28: On the Rabble</h3></a><p>Zarathustra&rsquo;s presents his opinion on the nature of the rabble (low-class people) that spreads poison and how the flame of the spirit is &ldquo;vexed when their moist hearts come near the fire.&rdquo; He states that although some turn away in disgust, the real question is, &ldquo;Does life require even the rabble?&rdquo; Zarathustra goes on to explain how his nausea arising from contact with the rabble is the source of his ability to find &ldquo;a life of which the rabble does not drink.&rdquo; He concludes his speech with the invitation to a state of being (home), which the rabble would find &ldquo;an ice cave to their bodies and their spirits.&rdquo;</p><a href=#chapter-29-on-the-tarantulas><h3 id=chapter-29-on-the-tarantulas><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 29: On the Tarantulas</h3></a><p>Zarathustra shows his disciples a tarantula burrow, and addresses the spider identified by its markings, saying, &ldquo;Revenge sits in your soul &mldr; you preachers of <em>equality</em>.&rdquo; He goes on to state this secret poison will be brought to light so &ldquo;<em>that man be delivered from revenge</em>.&rdquo; This determination pits Zarathustra against these &ldquo;preachers of equality&rdquo; in their effort to bring all men into an equal status under the justice of the law. Zarathustra declares the opposite is true, that &ldquo;men are not equal.&rdquo; Rather, different men are at different stages of development at any given moment of time, expressed in the statement. Although the tarantula&rsquo;s bite would make the soul &ldquo;whirl with revenge,&rdquo; Zarathustra declares he will &ldquo;never dance the tarantella.&rdquo;</p><a href=#chapter-30-on-the-famous-wise-men><h3 id=chapter-30-on-the-famous-wise-men><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 30: On the Famous Wise Men</h3></a><p>Zarathustra&rsquo;s next target is famous wise men who serve as beasts to the powerful.

<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Thus-Spoke-Zarathustra/character-analysis/#Zarathustra rel=noopener>Zarathustra</a>&rsquo;s attention drawn to his enemies who threaten to undermine and distort his teaching for their own ends. Although he seems to have sent his disciples/brothers away from him in the previous section, they seem to remain present as he directs his speeches to them on such topics as blindness, revenge, justice, and equality. He also decries wise men who gain fame through serving the masters of power by supporting this agenda of equality. This grouping of chapters ends on a lyrical note that likely reflects 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Thus-Spoke-Zarathustra/author/ rel=noopener>Nietzsche</a>&rsquo;s musical training.</p><p>Kaufmann argues in his Editor&rsquo;s Notes that Chapter 24: Upon the Blessed Isles is an expression of &ldquo;the creative life versus belief in God&rdquo; to be compared to &ldquo;the opening lines of the final chorus in Goethe&rsquo;s <em>Faust</em> &mldr; taken up again in [Chapter 39: On Poets].&rdquo; The idea of a kind of &ldquo;perishable&rdquo; deity fashioned in the minds of men as opposed to an inscrutably eternal being constitutes one of the first cracks Zarathustra makes into how religion usurps human creativity. He points out that if God is a human construct, then the true nature of deity originates in the self. One of Nietzsche&rsquo;s most iconic statements is his declaration that &ldquo;God is dead.&rdquo; However, as can be seen in <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em>, if God is dead, the question becomes a matter of how man in search of the &ldquo;overman&rdquo; retains a sustainable reverence for life and for himself. In other words, the issue can be seen as one of Zarathustra&rsquo;s reversals of opposites. The created is the creator, and the creator is a construct of the created (man).</p><p>The nausea referenced in Chapter 28: On the Rabble is, according to Kaufmann, a common theme in Nietzsche&rsquo;s writings. In <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em>, the nausea is a manifestation of Zarathustra&rsquo;s pity, because the rabble is without &ldquo;spirit.&rdquo; Even in such people, Zarathustra &ldquo;celebrates the spirit—not in opposition to the body but as <em>mens sana in corpore sano</em>&rdquo; (a sound mind in a healthy body). The origin of the phrase is credited to the Latin satirist and poet Juvenal.</p><p>The tarantella referred to in Chapter 29: On the Tarantulas is a fast-stepping, whirling, and flirtatious couples&rsquo; Italian folk dance. The name is connected to &ldquo;tarantism, a disease or form of hysteria that appeared in Italy in the 15th to the 17th centur[ies].&rdquo; It was falsely &ldquo;associated with the bite of the tarantula spider.&rdquo; Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen&rsquo;s three-act play, <em>A Doll&rsquo;s House</em> (1879), features the dance as an expression of the protagonist Nora&rsquo;s combined intent to both entertain and defy her husband. This symbolic rebellion of a wife against her husband&rsquo;s condescending attitude toward her is echoed in Zarathustra&rsquo;s parable of the tarantula. As Kaufmann emphatically notes in his analysis of this chapter, &ldquo;the claim of human equality is criticized as an expression of the <em>ressentiment</em> of the subequal.&rdquo; Since a wife would be regarded as subequal to her husband, the comparison is apt. However, Nietzsche might have been referring to this scene in the play as a way of communicating to the reader that Zarathustra would not need to resort to this kind of tactic because he is not subequal to anyone. The play upon the words <em>tarantula</em> and <em>tarantella</em> is an example of Nietzsche&rsquo;s frequent tendency in <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em> to indulge in witty word-play, an important aspect of his writing.</p><p>Chapter 30: On the Famous Wise Men, according to Kaufmann, suggests that, &ldquo;One cannot serve two masters: the people and the truth.&rdquo; Philosophers in the past have been too involved in appeasing public opinion by shaping their ideas into palatable truths that are also something of a lie. The way of truth, however, cannot accommodate this approach because it demands a highly individual &ldquo;passion and martyrdom&rdquo; and the self cannot benefit others by proxy. In other words, a savior who undergoes passion and martyrdom for others does so in vain—a deliberate jab by Nietzsche at Christianity. This wedge between self and religious belief has been previously alluded to in Chapter 3: On the Afterworldly. There is no heavenly reward for the soul severed from the body, for &ldquo;the life of the spirit and the life of the body are aspects of a single life.&rdquo;</p><p>Nietzsche and his alter ego Zarathustra comment on the ephemeral eternal nature of song and dance in Chapter 32: The Dancing Song. Singing and dancing are both pure and eternal precisely because these activities exist only in the present moment and are gone as soon as the dancer stops and the last note of the song has sounded. But even as a single present moment slips into the past and the future is yet to occur, the continually appearing present constantly reemerges as a &ldquo;reinvention&rdquo; of itself, thus binding the eternally ephemeral to an &ldquo;ephemeral eternity.&rdquo; This idea refutes the idea of eternity as a static and unchanging (dead) state, as implied in religious doctrine, by which spirit or soul is &ldquo;freed&rdquo; from a perishable body. Zarathustra suggests that it is precisely the perishability of the body that renders it as continuously dying and being reborn in an eternally unfolding dance. Thus Zarathustra identifies those who espouse the separation of body and spirit as enemies.</p><hr><a href=#part-2-chapters-3344--summary><h1 id=part-2-chapters-3344--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 2, Chapters 33–44 | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-5><h2 id=summary-5><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><a href=#chapter-33-the-tomb-song><h3 id=chapter-33-the-tomb-song><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 33: The Tomb Song</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Thus-Spoke-Zarathustra/character-analysis/#Zarathustra rel=noopener>Zarathustra</a> reflects upon &ldquo;the tombs of [his] youth.&rdquo; He tells his disciples the story of how he &ldquo;crossed the sea&rdquo; to visit the silent isle of tombs and pay homage to all he had loved: &ldquo;Verily, you have died too soon for me, you fugitives.&rdquo; He then rails against his enemies, whom he accuses of having &ldquo;murdered the visions and dearest wonders of [his] youth.&rdquo; Zarathustra struggles against the ghosts of these feelings but reaches a redeeming conclusion, &ldquo;Only where there are tombs are there resurrections.&rdquo;</p><a href=#chapter-34-on-self-overcoming><h3 id=chapter-34-on-self-overcoming><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 34: On Self-Overcoming</h3></a><p>The discourse of this chapter concerns the desire of the wise to set the parameters of good and evil. Zarathustra warns his listeners against the danger in this path stemming from an underlying desire &ldquo;that betrays &mldr; an ancient will to power.&rdquo; He makes three observations: &ldquo;Whatever lives, obeys,&rdquo; &ldquo;He who cannot obey himself is commanded&rdquo; and &ldquo;Commanding is harder than obeying.&rdquo; The goal, then, is to internalize both the commander and the one who obeys within the self instead of responding to external forces.

The solution to this is for the sublime man to &ldquo;jump over his shadow—and verily, into <em>his</em> sun.&rdquo; He accuses the sublime man of being stuck in a static position of self-admiration, something he will not be able to overcome until &ldquo;power becomes gracious and descends into the visible.&rdquo;</p><a href=#chapter-36-on-the-land-of-education><h3 id=chapter-36-on-the-land-of-education><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 36: On the Land of Education</h3></a><p>Zarathustra describes the &ldquo;land of education&rdquo; inhabited by &ldquo;men of today.&rdquo; Having landed in this place, Zarathustra finds himself moved to laughter as he states, &ldquo;Never had my eyes beheld anything so dappled and motley.&rdquo; He sees the faces of these men painted &ldquo;with the characters of the past written&rdquo; so that they can be &ldquo;concealed &mldr; perfectly from all interpreters of characters.&rdquo; Such men declare themselves above belief and superstitions such that they only believe in the truth, but Zarathustra tells them although they stick out their chests, &ldquo;they are hollow.&rdquo;</p><a href=#chapter-37-on-immaculate-perception><h3 id=chapter-37-on-immaculate-perception><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 37: On Immaculate Perception</h3></a><p>Zarathustra here makes play of the moon as if it were a feminine instead of a masculine entity: &ldquo;He is not much of a man either, this shy nocturnal enthusiast &mldr; like a cat the moon comes along, dishonestly.&rdquo; This leads him to denounce &ldquo;sentimental hypocrites&rdquo; as lechers who desire the earthly but feel a covert shame in their desire, as if such love were despicable. Instead, Zarathustra calls such men cowards for being unwilling to sacrifice themselves enough to covertly own their desire. He denounces them and berates them with the words, &ldquo;The will to love, that is to be willing also to die. Thus I speak to you cowards!&rdquo;</p><a href=#chapter-38-on-scholars><h3 id=chapter-38-on-scholars><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 38: On Scholars</h3></a><p>Zarathustra tells his listeners he has &ldquo;moved from the house of the scholars and &mldr; even banged the door behind [him].&rdquo; Instead, he lies where children play, preferring &ldquo;freedom and the air over the fresh earth.&rdquo; His estimation of scholars is that they &ldquo;want to be mere spectators&rdquo; who remain in awe of what others have thought before them. There follows a long list of what scholars are like. They are skillful and clever, &ldquo;good clockworks&rdquo; and mill grinds to &ldquo;grind it [knowledge] small and reduce it to white dust.&rdquo; Such men mistrust each other and look for every opportunity to discredit a fellow.</p><a href=#chapter-39-on-poets><h3 id=chapter-39-on-poets><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 39: On Poets</h3></a><p>A disciple asks Zarathustra why he has claimed poets lie, and he answers, &ldquo;It is &mldr; too much for me to remember my own opinions.&rdquo; Zarathustra says he is a poet also, and that as one, he lies because he knows too little. He does not, however, go bragging about secret things he thinks nature may have whispered in his ear, marking him as prideful of being unique among men as a poet.

As he passes them in the sky they fear he is on his way to disappear into hell. Although his disciples dismiss this idea as laughable, they worry about Zarathustra&rsquo;s disappearance until he returns five days later to recount his conversation with the fire hound. Zarathustra reports how he found the fire hound making a great noise over &ldquo;great events&rdquo; but no longer believes in such events that require so much fanfare: &ldquo;Not around the inventors of new noise, but around the inventors of new values does the world revolve; it revolves <em>inaudibly</em>.&rdquo; Zarathustra further berated the hound who liked &ldquo;to talk with smoke and bellowing—to make himself believe &mldr; he is talking out of the belly of reality.&rdquo; At this, the beast grew ashamed and &ldquo;crawled down into his cave.&rdquo;</p><a href=#chapter-41-the-soothsayer><h3 id=chapter-41-the-soothsayer><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 41: The Soothsayer</h3></a><p>Zarathustra describes the dismal words of a soothsayer, which made him so &ldquo;sad and weary&rdquo; that for three days he wandered about unable to speak or eat.

Worse than these, he tells them, is what he calls &ldquo;inverse cripples&rdquo; or people who are &ldquo;nothing but a big eye or a big mouth or a big belly.&rdquo; Zarathustra turns sorrowfully to his disciples and tells them, &ldquo;I walk among men as among the fragments and limbs of men.&rdquo; Rather than be bits and pieces of meaning to others, Zarathustra states he must be whole to himself and urges those who follow him to be whole to themselves as well.</p><a href=#chapter-43-on-human-prudence><h3 id=chapter-43-on-human-prudence><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 43: On Human Prudence</h3></a><p>Zarathustra discusses how living among men produces in him a duplicitous will such that he &ldquo;must be without caution.&rdquo; This is a test for him to see whether or not he is able to understand that what passes for evil among men is an illusion, &ldquo;The grossest wickedness &mldr; only twelve shoes wide and three months long.&rdquo; He states he has been willing to play along with a fear of the devil for a while, but not remain there.</p><a href=#chapter-44-the-stillest-hour><h3 id=chapter-44-the-stillest-hour><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 44: The Stillest Hour</h3></a><p>Zarathustra says, &ldquo;There spoke to me <em>my stillest hour</em>: that is the name of my awesome mistress.&rdquo; He describes to his disciples the way in which this mistress forced him to say what is in his heart, but he fears doing so because &ldquo;humility has the toughest hide.&rdquo; This is another test he must overcome, which is to realize his relationships with people do not matter more than he matters himself. The end result is that Zarathustra must leave his followers and return to solitude.</p><a href=#analysis-4><h2 id=analysis-4><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p>In this cluster of chapters, 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Thus-Spoke-Zarathustra/character-analysis/#Zarathustra rel=noopener>Zarathustra</a>&rsquo;s thoughts circle around the subterranean regions of hell (commencing with Chapter 40: On Great Events), the quiet serenity in bidding farewell to fond memories that lie like tombs in the mind, the subconscious expressions of desire in dreams, and conditions denying the vitality of life. This state of retiring solitude and internal reflection contrasts the previous sections in which Zarathustra describes positive and direct actions to neutralize the malice of enemies. However, there are pointed references to the opposite of private reflection in Zarathustra&rsquo;s speeches, which appear as opponents to the overman. Among them are those who enjoy a very public fame at the cost of serving the rich and powerful. Another consequence of public presence is given in reference to the beggars who surround Zarathustra in Chapter 42: On Redemption. In this case, Zarathustra turns away from the pity of those who plead with him to cure them. Instead, he tells his disciples/brothers that he can&rsquo;t do that because in so doing he would entirely remove the defining characteristics of these &ldquo;reverse cripples&rdquo; in a way that would correspondingly &ldquo;fragment&rdquo; his own being. The extension of this condition brings Zarathustra to the conclusion that in order to be whole unto himself he must leave his followers.</p><p>Chapter 37: On Immaculate Perception makes a more pointed reference to a priestly denial of sexuality than the more general Chapter 13: On Chastity. The idea presented here is the tendency to think about forbidden topics. The pairing of the feminine with the stealth of a cat in describing the moon in this chapter is steeped in folkloric references that align the feminine with darkness or night when cats prowl in secret. The moon is a symbol of fertility and female reproductive cycles in all animals. Its influence on the tides and continual shifting of phases represents the changing nature of a woman&rsquo;s words. She cannot be trusted to tell the truth in a reliable way.</p><p>In Chapter 40: On Great Events, the seamen hunting rabbits on the island know Zarathustra and recognize his figure flying through the air. But Zarathustra indicates to his disciples his visit with the fire hound took place while he slept, suggesting it was his own wanderer/shadow who made the journey. Such a &ldquo;projection&rdquo; of Zarathustra visible to the seamen could be interpreted as enacting an unrealized desire of Zarathustra to cross the seas.</p><p>Kaufmann says that Chapter 44: The Stillest Hour presents Zarathustra&rsquo;s problem: he &ldquo;cannot yet get himself to proclaim the eternal recurrence of the self, the desired state of continuous unfolding he has previously described to his disciples/brothers, and hence he must leave the company of his disciples/brothers in order to &lsquo;ripen.&rsquo;&rdquo; Zarathustra later states he has &ldquo;ripened&rdquo; in Chapter 80: The Sign such that all he has left is to wait for his third metamorphosis into the child. Such ripening does not happen entirely in solitude nor in the company of others, but in an anguished interplay of these two states. Zarathustra goes back and forth from being in the company of his disciples/brothers or other people and being alone. Problematically for the plot of <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra,</em> Zarathustraseems to continue to talk to his disciples/brothers even after he has sent them away. The question arises, if they are no longer present with Zarathustra, then to whom is he speaking, if not himself? A possible interpretation might be that Zarathustra continues to speak to others who are no longer present with him in a physical sense. In this respect, this cluster of chapters represents an emphasis on the process of engaging solitary internal reflections as a counterpoint to previous sections in which Zarathustra has actively shared his previous considerations with a growing company of disciples/brothers.</p><hr><a href=#part-3-chapters-4552--summary><h1 id=part-3-chapters-4552--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span> Part 3, Chapters 45–52 | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-6><h2 id=summary-6><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><a href=#chapter-45-the-wanderer><h3 id=chapter-45-the-wanderer><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 45: The Wanderer</h3></a><p>Determined to set sail,

Although they ask him questions, he remains silent for some time until he is able to listen to the talk of those &ldquo;who travel far and do not like to live without danger.&rdquo; After a few days, Zarathustra begins speaking to the seamen of the riddle of their lives, which they risk at every moment based on partial information about the many dangers of the sea. He describes to them his own fight in a vision with &ldquo;the spirit of gravity &mldr; half dwarf, half mole&rdquo; who fills his brain with leaden thoughts. He tells the seamen the only way to battle this fear is through courage. Zarathustra then experiences a vision of a shepherd with a snake in his mouth choking him to death. Zarathustra tries to pull the snake out, but unable to do so, he tells the shepherd to bite the head of the snake off. When he does and spits out the head of the snake, the shepherd becomes &ldquo;no longer human—one changed, radiant, <em>laughing!</em>&rdquo;</p><a href=#chapter-47-on-involuntary-bliss><h3 id=chapter-47-on-involuntary-bliss><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 47: On Involuntary Bliss</h3></a><p>Zarathustra has spent four days at sea, has overcome his gloom, and rejoices in his solitude.

Instead, he wanders around looking at things so he can determine if during his absence men have grown smaller or greater. He comes across a row of houses that look like toys to him. Zarathustra reflects on the idea these small men despise him because he does not &ldquo;envy their virtues,&rdquo; a factor separating him from others &ldquo;like the rooster in a strange yard.&rdquo; He observes their small virtue is connected to the small happiness of small men, which amounts to mere comfort. He sees they manage to go forward in their own way by &ldquo;hobbling.&rdquo; These self-imposed restrictions designed to please everyone are what Zarathustra refers to as &ldquo;mediocrity.&rdquo; He concludes his musings with the warning that the fire is coming to these people.</p><a href=#chapter-50-upon-the-mount-of-olives><h3 id=chapter-50-upon-the-mount-of-olives><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 50: Upon the Mount of Olives</h3></a><p>Zarathustra describes winter as an unwanted guest, even though he would rather endure &ldquo;a little chattering of teeth&rdquo; than pray to &ldquo;the potbellied fire idol.&rdquo; The sharp clarity brought on by winter helps Zarathustra keep his own counsel in silence, which he is quick to point out is not the same type of concealment practiced by those who &ldquo;veiled their faces and muddied their waters that nobody might see through them, deep down.&rdquo; He praises his oasis from the cold too, as he runs &ldquo;crisscross on [his] mount of olives with warm feet.&rdquo;</p><a href=#chapter-51-on-passing-by><h3 id=chapter-51-on-passing-by><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 51: On Passing By</h3></a><p>Zarathustra continues walking &ldquo;among many peoples and through numerous towns&rdquo; before returning to his cave.

He thinks others like him will find their first companions to be &ldquo;corpses and jesters &mldr; second companions, however, will call themselves his <em>believers</em>.&rdquo; But these companions are dangerous and not to be trusted because such youths change over time to become &ldquo;half-in-half spoil all that is whole.&rdquo; These are what he calls apostates. They make of their master a deity instead of growing into their own deifications.</p><a href=#analysis-5><h2 id=analysis-5><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p>Part 3 finds 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Thus-Spoke-Zarathustra/character-analysis/#Zarathustra rel=noopener>Zarathustra</a> taking a physical journey away from his island and cave. However, although he is in the presence of seamen during a ship voyage, he doesn&rsquo;t have much to say to them, insulating himself instead in his own thoughts. This mood continues at the end of his voyage, as Zarathustra walks among men in the towns and continues an internal dialogue with himself as if his followers are still with him. At the same time, he observes how few may be called to reach for the &ldquo;overman&rdquo; within themselves. Many are at risk to sidetrack themselves and their master by becoming &ldquo;apostates&rdquo; instead of seekers of their own metamorphosis. This frame of mind may be evocative of those periods of displacement in 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Thus-Spoke-Zarathustra/author/ rel=noopener>Nietzsche</a>&rsquo;s life when he served in the military and later found himself without citizenship. In general, this section finds Zarathustra alone among the crowds and in no hurry to impart wisdom to anyone even as he continues to process his observations to himself. He is also absorbed in the dynamics of pity, which present both subtle and not-so-subtle traps for him.</p><p>Zarathustra comes to empathize with others, like the seamen in Chapter 45: The Wanderer, who live dangerous lives. The daredevil stunt of the tightrope walker who risked and lost his life in Zarathustra&rsquo;s Prologue invoked sympathy from Zarathustra such that he carried the corpse and buried it in the hollow of a tree. Such ordinary but hard-working people interest Zarathustra more than educated artists, such as the poets in Chapter 39: On Poets, scholars, or scientists indirectly referenced in Chapter 38: On Scholars, and religious leaders targeted in Chapter 37: On Immaculate Perception.</p><p>Zarathustra plays the part of a prophet to the small men in Chapter 49: On Virtue that Makes Small with his declaration that the fire is coming to them. However, he isn&rsquo;t a biblical prophet foretelling the wrath of God, but rather he provides an opportunity for each one for individual growth. Kaufmann states, what &ldquo;Nietzsche is concerned with is not &mldr; a code of morals but a kind of man, not a syllabus of behavior but a state of being.&rdquo; In other words, Zarathustra is not interested in proclaiming the law by which morality and immorality may be determined. After all, the Iranian prophet upon whom this character is drawn states that it is only up to the supreme creator to make that judgment at the end of each person&rsquo;s life. Rather, the moral life to Zarathustra is completely individual and unique to each seeker. Given this approach, then, a biblical smiting of a group of people as a whole is not possible.</p><p>Zarathustra&rsquo;s feet are warm as he runs on the mount of olives in Chapter 50: Upon the Mount of Olives. The title appears to be a reference to the biblical &ldquo;Sermon on the Mount&rdquo; in the New Testament, a collection of religious teachings and ethical sayings from Jesus of Nazareth in the Book of Matthew, Chapters 5–7. This allusion amplifies Zarathustra&rsquo;s rejection of comfort, sleep, and trust in Jesus Christ to lift away all sin and pain. This rejection keeps him active and focused on his own metamorphosis. Even so, it appears Zarathustra enjoys a brief respite from suffering and enjoys having warm feet for a change.</p><p>The fool&rsquo;s comment about the stench of slaughtered spirits of the town and the ovens in Chapter 51: On Passing By is eerily evocative of the Holocaust—Nazi Germany&rsquo;s genocide of the Jews in the 1930s and 1940s. In any case, Zarathustra&rsquo;s revulsion emphasizes the difference between Zarathustra and his &ldquo;ape.&rdquo; Both he and his mimic vehemently express contempt and loathing, but as his mimic does so out of &ldquo;wounded vanity and vengefulness &mldr; Zarathustra&rsquo;s contempt is begotten by love [of man].&rdquo; Instead of a prophet-like condemnation from which there is no chance of escape, Zarathustra&rsquo;s harsh words are designed to waken slumbering spirits to the reality of their own willing entrapments. It is a call to action, growth, and change. Each individual spirit must become self-aware and conscientious in assuming responsibility for its own truth. The task is made more difficult in that it must do so under continually shifting conditions as presented in time and space. The theme of the overman and the task of the spirit to overcome itself foreshadows the collection of &ldquo;higher men&rdquo; Zarathustra will meet later in the book. Although these men are honest with themselves in a way people in this section are not, they still lack the ability to overcome themselves</p><hr><a href=#part-3-chapters-5360--summary><h1 id=part-3-chapters-5360--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 3, Chapters 53–60 | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-7><h2 id=summary-7><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><a href=#chapter-53-the-return-home><h3 id=chapter-53-the-return-home><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 53: The Return Home</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Thus-Spoke-Zarathustra/character-analysis/#Zarathustra rel=noopener>Zarathustra</a> is very happy to be home again surrounded by silence and solitude.

These are &ldquo;<em>sex, the lust to rule, [and] selfishness</em>.&rdquo; He proceeds to examine each one by balancing them as questions on a scale with their answers. The outcome of sex, in Zarathustra&rsquo;s mind, depends a great deal on the nature of the person, for it trips up despisers of the body. For the rabble, sex simply burns them. But, free hearts and the lion-willed find sex a &ldquo;higher happiness&rdquo; that may (or perhaps may not) include marriage. The lust to rule appeals to a person&rsquo;s vanity as a &ldquo;malicious gadfly,&rdquo; because a desire to lord over others eventually ends up turning back on that person. And regarding selfishness, there is a distinction between the impetus of a petty person who &ldquo;picks up even the smallest advantages&rdquo; and &ldquo;the dancer whose parable and epitome is the self-enjoying soul.&rdquo; In all three desires, then, what is for some a poison is for others very sweet indeed.</p><a href=#chapter-55-on-the-spirit-of-gravity><h3 id=chapter-55-on-the-spirit-of-gravity><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 55: On the Spirit of Gravity</h3></a><p>Zarathustra starts out by poking fun at himself as if he were a bird of prey that likes to eat lamb and says he could sing of this even though no one is there to hear it. The flight of birds and their defiance of gravity leads Zarathustra to consider how this is possible to a person who &ldquo;would become light and a bird.&rdquo; This person &ldquo;must love himself: thus <em>I</em> teach.&rdquo; He goes on to present gravity as an opponent to self-love. Instead, man needs to continue the struggle against this gravity that pulls him downward.</p><a href=#chapter-56-on-old-and-new-tablets><h3 id=chapter-56-on-old-and-new-tablets><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 56: On Old and New Tablets</h3></a><p>This chapter is composed of a series of 30 very short musings by Zarathustra to himself as he sits &ldquo;surrounded by broken old tablets and new tablets half covered with writing.&rdquo; He waits for a sign by which he may once again go among men. He recollects some of the things he has already said about laughing, the great and the small in man, and the meaning of the word &ldquo;overman&rdquo; because &ldquo;man is something that must be overcome.&rdquo; He glances over concepts about wanting something for nothing and being able to &ldquo;cross over&rdquo; because of a willingness to &ldquo;go under.&rdquo; In order to do this, however, one must give up the illusion of good and evil by throwing out all the old tablets. Zarathustra indulges here and there in wordplay, such as, &ldquo;Your wedlock: see to it that it not be a bad lock.&rdquo; He urges man to stand up in the noon light of the sun so the greatest challenges and mightiest victories of overcoming will find him.</p><a href=#chapter-57-the-convalescent><h3 id=chapter-57-the-convalescent><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 57: The Convalescent</h3></a><p>One morning, Zarathustra jumps up from his sleep and begins to yell, &ldquo;Hail to me! &mldr; My abyss speaks.&rdquo; He then falls down and lies as if dead for seven days. When he awakes, he is happy to once again enjoy the beauty of the earth. He remembers the nausea he felt in having seen the greatest in man is also the smallest, but his animals urge him that since he is convalescent, he should not speak but rather take his ease and enjoy the present moment of pleasure in the world of being alive.</p><a href=#chapter-58-on-the-great-longing><h3 id=chapter-58-on-the-great-longing><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 58: On the Great Longing</h3></a><p>Zarathustra addresses his soul and reminds himself of all the effort it has taken to give it strength and dignity or &ldquo;the right to say No like the storm, and to say Yes as the clear sky says Yes.&rdquo; By enumerating everything he did to give his own soul its freedom, he ends by asking his soul, &ldquo;Sing to me, sing, O my soul!

As such, they have the flavor and tone of koans, or brief statements designed to stimulate a discipline of meditation &ldquo;intended to exhaust the analytic intellect and the egoistic will, readying the mind to entertain an appropriate response on the intuitive level.&rdquo; As Kaufmann notes, 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Thus-Spoke-Zarathustra/author/ rel=noopener>Nietzsche</a> made several allusions to Goethe&rsquo;s <em>Faust</em> in many chapters of this book that reflect a poetic sensibility that is only scant in logical grounding. This kind of writing is, in fact, somewhat whimsical, puzzling, and filled with emotions. This grouping of chapters containing musings of 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Thus-Spoke-Zarathustra/character-analysis/#Zarathustra rel=noopener>Zarathustra</a> is particularly evocative of subjective states of mind that do not necessarily connect in logical ways one to another.</p><p>The statement, &ldquo;Thus <em>I</em> teach&rdquo; in Chapter 55: On the Spirit of Gravity is repeated several times in Zarathustra&rsquo;s speeches as a reminder to the reader that these things are from his own perspective and not universal standards. The distinction calls to mind why he berates scholars and teachers who teach everyone the same way.</p><p>The downward pull of gravity is reflected in the state of the camel (or the first metamorphosis of the spirit given in Chapter 1: The Three Metamorphoses) who is pulled to kneel and fold its legs under its belly (or to &ldquo;cush&rdquo;) so its back can be loaded with heavy baggage. All camelids (llamas and alpacas) naturally cush when tired of standing, or when confronted with stress or confusion they cannot handle.</p><p>Kaufmann offers an intriguing insight into Chapter 56: On Old and New Tablets by referencing Zarathustra&rsquo;s description of &ldquo;the despot in section 11, who has all history rewritten, seems to point forward in time to Hitler.&rdquo; Kaufmann also mentions the chapter contains several examples of wordplay in German that do not translate well into English, but which are part of the humor in <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em> that is often missed.</p><p>Chapter 59: The Other Dancing Song has Zarathustra dancing with life, represented as a winsome and delightful woman. At the end of the dance, Zarathustra whispers something in her ear to which the reader is not privy. Kaufmann believes Zarathustra tells her &ldquo;that after his death he will yet recur eternally.&rdquo; The 12 sharp expletives at the end of the chapter might speculatively be the crack of the whip Zarathustra waves at his (feminine counterpart, or mistress) life. Kaufmann also suggests these are the 12 &ldquo;strokes of the bell&rdquo; which also tolls in Chapter 79: The Drunken Song. Whether cracks of a whip or peals of a bell, sound is used in this passage as a series of sharp interruptions designed to break or fragment any sense of continuity of thought. The short phrases following each strike suggest only a tenuous flow of one key word to the next in meaning, but hardly bind them together in any other than an emotional line. This kind of writing is a distinct departure from the speeches Zarathustra has made throughout the book.</p><hr><a href=#part-4-chapters-6170--summary><h1 id=part-4-chapters-6170--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 4, Chapters 61–70 | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-8><h2 id=summary-8><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><a href=#chapter-61-the-honey-sacrifice><h3 id=chapter-61-the-honey-sacrifice><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 61: The Honey Sacrifice</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Thus-Spoke-Zarathustra/character-analysis/#Zarathustra rel=noopener>Zarathustra</a>&rsquo;s animals observe his general contentment and ask him about his happiness.

Zarathustra listens for a while to their conversation and realizes the two kings have been struggling with some of the same obstacles to overcoming the self as he has been. Zarathustra greets them and asks them what they are doing there. They reply, &ldquo;We are on our way to find the higher man—the man who is higher than we, though we are kings.&rdquo; Zarathustra tells them to wait for him in his cave while he continues to search for the source of the cry of distress.</p><a href=#chapter-64-the-leech><h3 id=chapter-64-the-leech><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 64: The Leech</h3></a><p>A man is lying on the ground across Zarathustra&rsquo;s path. The man had been sitting low to the ground with his arm in the water of a swamp. When he draws his arm out, it is covered with leeches and blood. Zarathustra is horrified and tells the man to go up to the cave where his wounds can be tended, but the man tells him he has been doing this deliberately, saying, &ldquo;Praised be the great leech of the conscience, Zarathustra!&rdquo; He tells Zarathustra he is &ldquo;<em>the conscientious in spirit</em> &mldr; there may well be none stricter, narrower, and harder than I.&rdquo; Pleased with the man&rsquo;s attitude, Zarathustra sends him to his cave and continues his search.</p><a href=#chapter-65-the-magician><h3 id=chapter-65-the-magician><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 65: The Magician</h3></a><p>Zarathustra comes upon a man who &ldquo;kept looking around with piteous gestures, like one abandoned and forsaken by all the world.&rdquo; He listens to the man&rsquo;s lament, which is like a long poem to &ldquo;Thou unknown <em>god</em>,&rdquo; an entity that causes the man every kind of torture and suffering. Zarathustra sees through the ruse and beats the man with his staff, saying, &ldquo;Stop it, you actor &mldr; you wicked magician &mldr; In <em>whom</em> was I to believe when you were moaning this way?&rdquo; The magician confesses he was playing the part of &ldquo;the ascetic of the spirit&rdquo; and tells Zarathustra he is pleased with his ability to make Zarathustra believe for even a short while. At this, Zarathustra takes a closer look at what just happened and finds a small truth in the magician&rsquo;s statement, &ldquo;I did all this only as a game.&rdquo; Zarathustra sends the magician to his cave before he continues &ldquo;on his way, laughing.&rdquo;</p><a href=#chapter-66-retired><h3 id=chapter-66-retired><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 66: Retired</h3></a><p>A tall, dark-robed man is sitting by the path, and the look of him so displeases Zarathustra that he would like to avoid him. But the man spots Zarathustra and asks him for help because he has lost his way. He says he is a retired pope in search of a festival at Zarathustra&rsquo;s cave. Zarathustra tells the man, &ldquo;It is I, the godless Zarathustra, who speaks: who is more godless than I, that I may enjoy his instruction?&rdquo; The old pope describes how he served his god faithfully, but &ldquo;was a concealed god, addicted to secrecy.&rdquo; As his servant, the old pope came to view how this god fathered a son through adultery and realized the two roles of being a loving god and a judging god are incompatible ones.

Revolted, Zarathustra turns away but the being manages to speak, asking Zarathustra to guess his riddle, &ldquo;What is <em>the revenge against the witness</em>?&rdquo; Zarathustra recognizes the being as the ugliest man who murdered god and &ldquo;took revenge on this witness.&rdquo; The ugliest man agrees Zarathustra has solved the riddle by recognizing himself as the witness.

After running for a while, Zarathustra finds it is futile and he stops to question his shadow. His shadow explains how close he is to Zarathustra himself, saying, &ldquo;Wherever you sat, I sat too &mldr; with you I broke whatever my heart revered.&rdquo; The shadow ends his speech saying he is in search of his home.

There is in it also a gentle self-mocking on the part of 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Thus-Spoke-Zarathustra/character-analysis/#Zarathustra rel=noopener>Zarathustra</a> as he successively encounters each of the &ldquo;higher men&rdquo; and it is through these empathic exchanges he slowly becomes entangled in his pity for them. The translation of the word <em>pity</em> from the use 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Thus-Spoke-Zarathustra/author/ rel=noopener>Nietzsche</a> had put to the German word <em>mitleid</em> was one Kaufmann struggled to render accurately. The term also refers to a kind of compassion because it also means &ldquo;suffering with.&rdquo; However, Kaufmann notes that the word <em>pity</em> also carries a note of condescension consistent with Zarathustra&rsquo;s superior standing relative to those around him as Nietzsche has drawn his alter ego character.</p><p>Chapter 61: The Honey Sacrifice is an emphatic example of Zarathustra&rsquo;s thinking when he reverses the height of the mountain on which honey can be gathered to the depths of the sea, where baited hooks of the fishermen await a good catch. There is in this a good measure of gentle humor in this thinking.</p><p>The &ldquo;king at the left&rdquo; and the &ldquo;king at the right&rdquo; in Chapter 63: Conversation with the Kings is the first of seven events that bring Zarathustra in contact with, as Kaufman states, &ldquo;Men who have accepted some part of his teaching without, however, embodying the type he envisages.&rdquo; But Zarathustra struggles with his interest in them while at the same time being repulsed by their &ldquo;revolting and tiresome flatteries.&rdquo;</p><p>In Chapter 65: The Magician, the magician&rsquo;s ability to entice Zarathustra for even a brief moment brings up the veracity of &ldquo;performing&rdquo; the truth, which is a lie because it is not actual reality. People are &ldquo;tricked&rdquo; into believing what is not true, similar to the &ldquo;willing suspension of disbelief&rdquo; in the performing arts by which an audience participates in an experience of aesthetics. In this scenario, both the performer and the audience &ldquo;cooperate&rdquo; in the event. Kaufmann adds that the character of the magician was informed in part by Nietzsche&rsquo;s friend, the composer Richard Wagner.</p><p>The elusive character of the wanderer/shadow who appeared earlier in Chapter 40: On Great Events makes a reappearance in Chapter 69: The Shadow. Nietzsche had, according to Kaufmann, a fascination with a man and his shadow expressed in his previous work, <em>The Wanderer and His Shadow</em> (1880). Other authors who have explored this idea of a man confronted by his &ldquo;double&rdquo; include Danish author Hans Christian Andersen in his tale <em>The Shadow</em> (1847) and Prussian author E.T.A. Hoffmann&rsquo;s version of Peter Schlemihl who lost his shadow in <em>The Sandman</em> (1816).</p><p>Chapter 70: At Noon is one of several instances throughout <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em> in which reference is made to the cycle of night and day. Nietzsche aligns this measure of time with the lifetime of a man. This repetition suggests the riddle of the Sphinx (a mythological being with the body of a lion, the wings of a bird, and the head of a woman) to Oedipus in Greek legend, which likens the span of a day to the 3 life-stages of a man. As a whole, <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em> narrates the adventure as one externally occurring over the span of several years, but there are also several plays on the nature of time and space on an internal level alluding to the periods of a single day. For example, Zarathustra may have completed stage one of his spiritual metamorphosis as a camel during the &ldquo;morning&rdquo; period of his spiritual life. This corresponds to the correct answer to the Sphinx&rsquo;s riddle that it is in the morning of a man&rsquo;s life that he crawls on all fours. During the second spiritual metamorphosis as a lion, like an adult male who walks on two legs during the &ldquo;noon&rdquo; of his life, man struggles to gain power over the self of will.</p><hr><a href=#part-4-chapters-6170--summary-1><h1 id=part-4-chapters-6170--summary-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 4, Chapters 61–70 | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-9><h2 id=summary-9><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><a href=#chapter-61-the-honey-sacrifice-1><h3 id=chapter-61-the-honey-sacrifice-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 61: The Honey Sacrifice</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Thus-Spoke-Zarathustra/character-analysis/#Zarathustra rel=noopener>Zarathustra</a>&rsquo;s animals observe his general contentment and ask him about his happiness.

The soothsayer replies he has come to Zarathustra to test him with pity for &ldquo;the higher man.&rdquo; They then part ways. Zarathustra goes in search of the higher man and the soothsayer leaves to wait for him in his cave.</p><a href=#chapter-63-conversation-with-the-kings-1><h3 id=chapter-63-conversation-with-the-kings-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 63: Conversation with the Kings</h3></a><p>Zarathustra searches no longer than an hour before he comes across two richly adorned kings—one on the right and one on the left—leading an ass loaded with baggage. Zarathustra listens for a while to their conversation and realizes the two kings have been struggling with some of the same obstacles to overcoming the self as he has been. Zarathustra greets them and asks them what they are doing there. They reply, &ldquo;We are on our way to find the higher man—the man who is higher than we, though we are kings.&rdquo; Zarathustra tells them to wait for him in his cave while he continues to search for the source of the cry of distress.</p><a href=#chapter-64-the-leech-1><h3 id=chapter-64-the-leech-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 64: The Leech</h3></a><p>A man is lying on the ground across Zarathustra&rsquo;s path. The man had been sitting low to the ground with his arm in the water of a swamp. When he draws his arm out, it is covered with leeches and blood. Zarathustra is horrified and tells the man to go up to the cave where his wounds can be tended, but the man tells him he has been doing this deliberately, saying, &ldquo;Praised be the great leech of the conscience, Zarathustra!&rdquo; He tells Zarathustra he is &ldquo;<em>the conscientious in spirit</em> &mldr; there may well be none stricter, narrower, and harder than I.&rdquo; Pleased with the man&rsquo;s attitude, Zarathustra sends him to his cave and continues his search.</p><a href=#chapter-65-the-magician-1><h3 id=chapter-65-the-magician-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 65: The Magician</h3></a><p>Zarathustra comes upon a man who &ldquo;kept looking around with piteous gestures, like one abandoned and forsaken by all the world.&rdquo; He listens to the man&rsquo;s lament, which is like a long poem to &ldquo;Thou unknown <em>god</em>,&rdquo; an entity that causes the man every kind of torture and suffering. Zarathustra sees through the ruse and beats the man with his staff, saying, &ldquo;Stop it, you actor &mldr; you wicked magician &mldr; In <em>whom</em> was I to believe when you were moaning this way?&rdquo; The magician confesses he was playing the part of &ldquo;the ascetic of the spirit&rdquo; and tells Zarathustra he is pleased with his ability to make Zarathustra believe for even a short while. At this, Zarathustra takes a closer look at what just happened and finds a small truth in the magician&rsquo;s statement, &ldquo;I did all this only as a game.&rdquo; Zarathustra sends the magician to his cave before he continues &ldquo;on his way, laughing.&rdquo;</p><a href=#chapter-66-retired-1><h3 id=chapter-66-retired-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 66: Retired</h3></a><p>A tall, dark-robed man is sitting by the path, and the look of him so displeases Zarathustra that he would like to avoid him. But the man spots Zarathustra and asks him for help because he has lost his way. He says he is a retired pope in search of a festival at Zarathustra&rsquo;s cave. Zarathustra tells the man, &ldquo;It is I, the godless Zarathustra, who speaks: who is more godless than I, that I may enjoy his instruction?&rdquo; The old pope describes how he served his god faithfully, but &ldquo;was a concealed god, addicted to secrecy.&rdquo; As his servant, the old pope came to view how this god fathered a son through adultery and realized the two roles of being a loving god and a judging god are incompatible ones. Zarathustra figures he&rsquo;d like to hear more about all this. He assures the old pope god is completely dead and tells him to go up to his cave and wait there for Zarathustra&rsquo;s return.</p><a href=#chapter-67-the-ugliest-man-1><h3 id=chapter-67-the-ugliest-man-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 67: The Ugliest Man</h3></a><p>The search for the cry of distress continues to draw Zarathustra along his path until he &ldquo;enter[s] a realm of death.&rdquo; Everything there is loathsome and devoid of life, and Zarathustra walks through it until he stands still and sees something sitting that almost looks like a human being. Revolted, Zarathustra turns away but the being manages to speak, asking Zarathustra to guess his riddle, &ldquo;What is <em>the revenge against the witness</em>?&rdquo; Zarathustra recognizes the being as the ugliest man who murdered god and &ldquo;took revenge on this witness.&rdquo; The ugliest man agrees Zarathustra has solved the riddle by recognizing himself as the witness. Zarathustra turns away, but the ugliest man begs him to stay. Zarathustra tells the ugliest man to go to his cave and wait for him there before continuing his search.</p><a href=#chapter-68-the-voluntary-beggar-1><h3 id=chapter-68-the-voluntary-beggar-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 68: The Voluntary Beggar</h3></a><p>The land through which Zarathustra travels becomes green and warm and refreshes his spirit following the unpleasant land he has just left. Amazed, he finds himself attracted by a herd of cows who surround a speaker and seem to be listening to him. Pushing aside the cows, Zarathustra finds a man sitting on the ground apparently preaching to the cows, saying things like, &ldquo;Except we turn back and become as cows, we shall not enter the kingdom of heaven.&rdquo; When he sees Zarathustra, the man recognizes him and greets him joyfully, saying he himself is &ldquo;the voluntary beggar.&rdquo; Zarathustra asks the beggar why he should seek happiness among the cows instead of among the rich, but this beggar will have none of that, because as he says, &ldquo;I was nauseated by our richest men &mldr; this gilded, false mob whose fathers have been pickpockets.&rdquo; Zarathustra tells the voluntary beggar to go to his cave and wait for him there.</p><a href=#chapter-69-the-shadow-1><h3 id=chapter-69-the-shadow-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 69: The Shadow</h3></a><p>Once the voluntary beggar leaves, Zarathustra thinks he is alone but a voice behind him calls on him to wait and says he is Zarathustra&rsquo;s shadow. Annoyed by all this unwanted company, Zarathustra tries to run away from his shadow, but soon discovers there are three runners instead of two. The involuntary beggar has joined the chase. After running for a while, Zarathustra finds it is futile and he stops to question his shadow. His shadow explains how close he is to Zarathustra himself, saying, &ldquo;Wherever you sat, I sat too &mldr; with you I broke whatever my heart revered.&rdquo; The shadow ends his speech saying he is in search of his home. Zarathustra recognizes the nature of this shadow as a wanderer. Feeling pity for his shadow, Zarathustra sends him to his cave for a &ldquo;rest and home this evening&rdquo; before going on alone.</p><a href=#chapter-70-at-noon-1><h3 id=chapter-70-at-noon-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 70: At Noon</h3></a><p>Fatigued by all his running, Zarathustra feels the need to rest at noon and lies down by a tree to sleep.

There is in it also a gentle self-mocking on the part of 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Thus-Spoke-Zarathustra/character-analysis/#Zarathustra rel=noopener>Zarathustra</a> as he successively encounters each of the &ldquo;higher men&rdquo; and it is through these empathic exchanges he slowly becomes entangled in his pity for them. The translation of the word <em>pity</em> from the use 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Thus-Spoke-Zarathustra/author/ rel=noopener>Nietzsche</a> had put to the German word <em>mitleid</em> was one Kaufmann struggled to render accurately. The term also refers to a kind of compassion because it also means &ldquo;suffering with.&rdquo; However, Kaufmann notes that the word <em>pity</em> also carries a note of condescension consistent with Zarathustra&rsquo;s superior standing relative to those around him as Nietzsche has drawn his alter ego character.</p><p>Chapter 61: The Honey Sacrifice is an emphatic example of Zarathustra&rsquo;s thinking when he reverses the height of the mountain on which honey can be gathered to the depths of the sea, where baited hooks of the fishermen await a good catch. There is in this a good measure of gentle humor in this thinking.</p><p>The &ldquo;king at the left&rdquo; and the &ldquo;king at the right&rdquo; in Chapter 63: Conversation with the Kings is the first of seven events that bring Zarathustra in contact with, as Kaufman states, &ldquo;Men who have accepted some part of his teaching without, however, embodying the type he envisages.&rdquo; But Zarathustra struggles with his interest in them while at the same time being repulsed by their &ldquo;revolting and tiresome flatteries.&rdquo;</p><p>In Chapter 65: The Magician, the magician&rsquo;s ability to entice Zarathustra for even a brief moment brings up the veracity of &ldquo;performing&rdquo; the truth, which is a lie because it is not actual reality. People are &ldquo;tricked&rdquo; into believing what is not true, similar to the &ldquo;willing suspension of disbelief&rdquo; in the performing arts by which an audience participates in an experience of aesthetics. In this scenario, both the performer and the audience &ldquo;cooperate&rdquo; in the event. Kaufmann adds that the character of the magician was informed in part by Nietzsche&rsquo;s friend, the composer Richard Wagner.</p><p>The elusive character of the wanderer/shadow who appeared earlier in Chapter 40: On Great Events makes a reappearance in Chapter 69: The Shadow. Nietzsche had, according to Kaufmann, a fascination with a man and his shadow expressed in his previous work, <em>The Wanderer and His Shadow</em> (1880). Other authors who have explored this idea of a man confronted by his &ldquo;double&rdquo; include Danish author Hans Christian Andersen in his tale <em>The Shadow</em> (1847) and Prussian author E.T.A. Hoffmann&rsquo;s version of Peter Schlemihl who lost his shadow in <em>The Sandman</em> (1816).</p><p>Chapter 70: At Noon is one of several instances throughout <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em> in which reference is made to the cycle of night and day. Nietzsche aligns this measure of time with the lifetime of a man. This repetition suggests the riddle of the Sphinx (a mythological being with the body of a lion, the wings of a bird, and the head of a woman) to Oedipus in Greek legend, which likens the span of a day to the 3 life-stages of a man. As a whole, <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em> narrates the adventure as one externally occurring over the span of several years, but there are also several plays on the nature of time and space on an internal level alluding to the periods of a single day. For example, Zarathustra may have completed stage one of his spiritual metamorphosis as a camel during the &ldquo;morning&rdquo; period of his spiritual life. This corresponds to the correct answer to the Sphinx&rsquo;s riddle that it is in the morning of a man&rsquo;s life that he crawls on all fours. During the second spiritual metamorphosis as a lion, like an adult male who walks on two legs during the &ldquo;noon&rdquo; of his life, man struggles to gain power over the self of will.</p><hr><a href=#quotes><h1 id=quotes><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Quotes</h1></a><ol><li></li></ol><blockquote><p>I teach you the overman._ Man is something that shall be overcome.

<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Thus-Spoke-Zarathustra/character-analysis/#Zarathustra rel=noopener>Zarathustra</a> expresses his ideas to himself and to others willing to listen to him. For the most part, Zarathustra attributes human characteristics and motives to animals by way of illustrating some of his most important issues on deceit, revenge, and the metamorphosis of the spirit. Other than the adder, only Zarathustra&rsquo;s companions of the eagle and the serpent are enabled with human speech. It can be taken that these animals represent Zarathustra&rsquo;s musings in his solitude in contrast to his teachings when he is in the company of other people.</p><ul><li><strong>Birds</strong> figure prominently throughout Zarathustra&rsquo;s discourses. His eagle is described as &ldquo;the proudest animal under the sun&rdquo; in the Prologue. While the &ldquo;flightiness&rdquo; of birds is an image of women, as presented in Chapter 14: On the Friend, flights of birds reference hope for the hero in Chapter 8: On the Tree on the Mountainside.</li><li>The <strong>camel</strong> symbolizes the first transformation of the spirit in Chapter 1: On the Three Metamorphoses. Zarathustra states, &ldquo;That would bear much takes upon itself: like the camel that, burdened, speeds into the desert.&rdquo;</li><li>The <strong>cat</strong> is described as an untrustworthy creature of deception, similar to women. Zarathustra tells his listeners in Chapter 14: On the Friend that women cannot be trusted in friendship because they &ldquo;are still cats and birds.&rdquo;</li><li>The <strong>tarantula</strong> is described as a symbol of revenge against anyone who is beyond their equal in Zarathustra&rsquo;s speech in Chapter 29: On the Tarantulas. He addresses this creature by saying, &ldquo;Revenge sits in your soul: wherever you bite, black scabs grow; your poison makes the soul whirl with revenge.&rdquo;</li><li>The <strong>lion</strong> represents the will and the courage to act upon the will. As the second transformation of the spirit, described in Chapter 1: On the Three Metamorphoses, Zarathustra says the transitional spirit &ldquo;becomes a lion who would conquer his freedom and be master in his own desert.&rdquo;</li><li><strong>Flies</strong> represent noisy crowds in public places. Chapter 12: On the Flies of the Marketplace presents Zarathustra&rsquo;s speech about the multitudes of little people there as &ldquo;the buzzing of the poisonous flies.&rdquo; Zarathustra urges his listeners to leave for solitude as he tells them, &ldquo;It is not your lot to shoo flies.&rdquo;</li><li>The <strong>serpent</strong> appears in Zarathustra&rsquo;s Prologue to symbolize a mystic wisdom that defies education. Zarathustra describes this animal companion as &ldquo;the wisest animal under the sun.&rdquo;</li></ul><a href=#blood><h2 id=blood><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Blood</h2></a><p>Blood is a powerful symbol of both life and death in the struggle to realize either private or public power. 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Thus-Spoke-Zarathustra/author/ rel=noopener>Nietzsche</a> uses blood to compare and contrast the condemned criminal and the judge who sentences him to death. Given the description of Chapter 6: On the Pale Criminal, it appears the person is pale from lack of blood, since &ldquo;he was equal to his deed when he did it; but he could not bear its image after it was done.&rdquo; 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Thus-Spoke-Zarathustra/character-analysis/#Zarathustra rel=noopener>Zarathustra</a> addresses those who condemn the criminal through the image of the criminal&rsquo;s act as &ldquo;you, red [with blood] judge, if you were to tell &mldr; all that you have &mldr; done &mldr; everyone would cry, &lsquo;Away with this &mldr; this poisonous worm!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>The association of blood with public and private revenge is further amplified in Chapter 26: On Priests in which Zarathustra says, &ldquo;They wrote signs of blood on the way they walked &mldr; But &mldr; blood poisons &mldr; the purest doctrine and turns it into &mldr; hatred of the heart.&rdquo;</p><a href=#bridge><h2 id=bridge><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Bridge</h2></a><p>A bridge in <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em> represents a crossing over from one identity or state of being into another.

<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Thus-Spoke-Zarathustra/author/ rel=noopener>Nietzsche</a> from the teachings of the Iranian prophet Zoroaster (also named Zarathustra). <em>The Gathas</em>, a collection of hymns attributed to Zoroaster, deal with the separation of good from bad people who, upon death, must &ldquo;pass over the Bridge of the Requiter&rdquo; in order to come to judgment, whereupon they are separated to either dwell in &ldquo;the kingdom of everlasting joy and delight&rdquo; or be &ldquo;consigned to the regions of horror and darkness.&rdquo;</p><a href=#figs><h2 id=figs><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Figs</h2></a><p>Figs are representations of what the disciple thirsts for from the spiritual master. 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Thus-Spoke-Zarathustra/character-analysis/#Zarathustra rel=noopener>Zarathustra</a> tells his disciples in Chapter 24: Upon the Blessed Isles, &ldquo;Thus, like figs, these teachings fall to you, my friends; now consume their juice and their sweet meat.&rdquo; In this way, Zarathustra urges his disciples/brothers to enjoy the &ldquo;flavor&rdquo; of his teachings as if their spirits had been starving for a long time and then suddenly were able to enjoy what the world at large had been scarce in providing them. The gift of this sweetness is to be savored in the time it has been received and remembered, however, because what Zarathustra has to offer falls like ripe figs at a certain and limited time. At least twice in <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em> he sends his disciples/brothers away from him so that each one of them can keep for himself what he has received and use it to realize the metamorphosis of his own spirit.</p><hr><a href=#motifs><h1 id=motifs><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Motifs</h1></a><a href=#lightness-and-gravity><h2 id=lightness-and-gravity><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Lightness and Gravity</h2></a><p>Lightness is used in at least three different ways in <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em>.
