The prison, he argues, embodies a view of justice that makes it fundamentally different from older forms of punishment, such as public executions and torture. In Foucault&rsquo;s analysis prisons are places of discipline: their purpose is not necessarily to prevent or even punish crime so much as to change the habits of offenders. Although Foucault wrote extensively about power relations in public and private life,Â <em>Discipline and Punish</em>Â remains his best known single work. Its insights are applicable not only to literal prisons but to any systemâ€”schools, hospitals, workplacesâ€”in which order is established through an enforced routine.</p><a href=#about-the-title><h3 id=about-the-title><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>About the Title</h3></a><p>The title refers to the rise of the modern prison system as a replacement for older forms of penal justice. Foucault describes this system as designed not only to punish crime but also to discipline offenders by changing their behavior.</p><hr><a href=#main-ideas><h1 id=main-ideas><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Main Ideas</h1></a><a href=#disciplining-the-soul-not-punishing-the-body><h2 id=disciplining-the-soul-not-punishing-the-body><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Disciplining the Soul, Not Punishing the Body</h2></a><p>In broad terms,Â <em>Discipline and Punish</em>Â examines society&rsquo;s transition from a mode of penal justice based on punishing the body to one based on disciplining the soul. The tortures and executions recounted in Part 1 have no rehabilitative aim: the condemned person is expected to suffer and die, not to learn a moral lesson or become a productive member of society. This concept of penal justice was sometimes rationalized as a paying back of a societal debt or as a way of reasserting the power of the law over the powerlessness of the offender. By the end of the 18th century, however, serious and widespread objections to both this system and the rhetoric that justified it had arisen. Some reformers, as described in Part 2, believed a system typified by torture and public execution was excessiveâ€”or, to put the complaint in less altruistic terms, inefficient. Public executions consumed the resources of the Crown, agitated the crowd, and left little to show for it but a charred or mangled body.</p><p>Thus, as Foucault recounts, began the search for a less wasteful system of punishment. To be efficient, such a system would have to focus on reforming as many offenders as possible rather than destroying or damaging them, mentally or physically, beyond repair. It would also have to serve as an effective deterrent to would-be criminals. The aim of rehabilitation or reform necessarily meant devising a system that could go to work on the mind rather than, or in addition to, the body of the convict. The &ldquo;analogical punishments&rdquo; advocated by reformers such as Beccaria would do this by teaching criminals to despise their evil urges. The lazy would be forced to work until they were no longer lazy, and the greedy would be fined to teach them respect for others&rsquo; possessions.</p><p>The modern prison system, the solution that actually took root throughout the Western world, also reflected this rehabilitative aimâ€”at least initially. (Foucault teases out the admittedly complicated relationship between modern penal practice and rehabilitation in Part 4_._) Late 18th-century penitentiaries like the Walnut Street Prison in Philadelphia (founded 1773) were built and run with the explicit aim of making the prisoners into better people by the time they left. Work was one component of this strategy, while prayer and instructive reading were others. The Rasphuis and the Spinhuis, two Dutch penitentiaries Foucault mentions, were similarly envisioned as rehabilitative environments. Again, labor was part of the recipe: the Rasphuis, literally &ldquo;Rasp House,&rdquo; was named for its practice of requiring inmates to rasp pieces of wood into shavings. The Spinhuis (&ldquo;Spin House&rdquo;) employed its inmates in spinning textiles. These were physically demanding forms of labor, but the stated goal was to reform prisoners, not simply tire them out.</p><p>Foucault also describes a less obvious way in which modern prisons have aimed at disciplining the &ldquo;soul&rdquo; of the inmate. He argues that modern penal justice aims, ultimately, at reforming the prisoner into a docile and socially useful individual. However, this aim does not mean the prison system seeks to eliminate all crime or prevent recidivism, or relapsing into former modes of behavior. To assume prisons tryâ€”and failâ€”to reach these goals would be, Foucault says, a mistake. Indeed, even delinquents, or petty repeat offenders, are of value to society. For instance, they may act as informers who allow police to keep tabs on the progress of more serious crimes. To put Foucault&rsquo;s thesis into brutally mechanical terms, the old, corporal-punishment-based system &ldquo;threw away&rdquo; criminals, whereas the modern prison-based system repurposes or recycles them into delinquents.</p><a href=#panopticism-as-a-feature-of-modern-society><h2 id=panopticism-as-a-feature-of-modern-society><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Panopticism as a Feature of Modern Society</h2></a><p>Perhaps the most memorable image fromÂ <em>Discipline and Punish</em>Â is the panopticon: an architectural system originally envisioned by English philosopher Jeremy Bentham. Described in detail in Part 3, Chapter 3, the panopticon consists of a single central watchtower in the middle of a multistory ring of cells. From within the watchtower, the prison wardensâ€”or asylum keepers or doctors as the case might beâ€”can observe the inmates or patients without being observed themselves. The inmates, meanwhile, are unable to see each other, since their cell walls are arranged to make only the exterior of the watchtower visible.</p><p>Bentham prescribed the panopticon as a plan for all sorts of institutionsâ€”not only prisons, but schools, hospitals, and workplaces as well. Perhaps, unsurprisingly, these are the same locations in which Foucault charts the rise of disciplinary tactics throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. Bentham touted his creation as an extremely efficient system because it did not require the constant presence of a warden to create the impression of surveillanceâ€”and theÂ <em>impression</em>, after all, was what counted. Visitors, family members, and curious members of the public could all, Bentham suggested, visit the tower and take part in the surveillance if they wished.</p><p>Under such a system, the inmates would be aware they might be watched at any timeâ€”in principle, by anyoneâ€”without ever knowing for sure whether theyÂ <em>were</em>Â being watched. Although the panopticon served as the inspiration for several actual prisons in the 19th and 20th centuries, Foucault is more concerned with theÂ <em>panoptic</em>Â character of modern society, which he sees as going hand in hand with the rise of disciplinary systems. Social institutions, Foucault says, are like panopticons, designed not only to surveil a population but also to create a sense of potentially being watched at any time. Panoptic systems and behaviors are extensive and intensive. People are monitored and controlledâ€”by visible and invisible forcesâ€”in many facets of life and have come to expect such surveillance in a disciplinary society.</p><a href=#visibility-is-a-trap><h2 id=visibility-is-a-trap><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Visibility Is a Trap</h2></a><p>The panopticon also illustrates a broader point about the changing nature of penal justice: in the modern era, visibility is a trap. As Foucault points out, in the old era of monarchism, visibility was a privilege: one of the many things the &ldquo;haves&rdquo; had and the &ldquo;have-nots&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t. Rulers, aristocrats, and even wealthy gentry could have their stories recorded by chroniclers and their family&rsquo;s deeds commemorated by a coat of arms. A poor commoner, in contrast, might live and die with no other documentation than hastily jotted birth, marriage, and death records. The lower classes of society were popularly understood as a shapeless mob, sometimes caricatured in the literature of the era as a many-headed beast. To emerge from that mob and attain public visibility, one needed to achieve a high degree of fame or infamy.</p><p>Perhaps nothing captures the old relationship between visibility and power as well as the elaborate pageantry of the Sun King&rsquo;s court. Louis XIV (1638â€“1718), France&rsquo;s longest-reigning king, made a point of ensuring all eyes were on him. At fixed times of day, he conducted elaborate ceremonies in which the entire court at Versailles was expected to be present. Even waking up for the day and going to bed were elaborate rituals, called theÂ <em>grande levÃ©e</em>Â (&ldquo;great getting-up&rdquo;) and theÂ <em>grande couchÃ©e</em>Â (&ldquo;great lying-down&rdquo;), with prescribed roles for everyone. Being involved in these ceremoniesâ€”snuffing the candles at bedtime, for exampleâ€”was considered a great privilege, for the majority of the court simply looked on. By keeping himself in the proverbial spotlight, Louis XIV made himself the symbolic, as well as the political, center of court life.</p><p>With the rise of discipline and its permeation throughout society&rsquo;s institutions, things changed. Visibility was no longer the privilege of the fortunate but the plight of the less fortunate. Factory workers were watched by their supervisors, students were watched by hall monitors and prefects, and inmates were watched by wardens. Anonymity and invisibility became the real privilegesâ€”difficult for an ordinary person to defend against the encroachment of surveillance at work, at school, or in the streets. Visibility thus became a &ldquo;trap&rdquo; in the sense that the individuals, surveilled by so many different institutions, came to expect they were being watched at all times. In the same way as the panopticon forced the inmate to actÂ <em>as if</em>Â the warden were watching at all times, the threat of perpetual surveillance leads individuals to internalize disciplinary demands even when nobody is, in fact, watching.</p><hr><a href=#context><h1 id=context><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Context</h1></a><a href=#france-in-the-age-of-revolution><h2 id=france-in-the-age-of-revolution><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>France in the Age of Revolution</h2></a><a href=#the-ancien-rÃ©gime><h4 id=the-ancien-rÃ©gime><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Ancien RÃ©gime</h4></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Discipline-and-Punish-The-Birth-of-the-Prison/author/ rel=noopener>Michel Foucault</a>&rsquo;s history begins during a period known to modern historians as theÂ <em>ancien rÃ©gime</em>Â (literally, &ldquo;old order&rdquo;): France as it existed from the late Middle Ages until the French Revolution (1789â€“99). From the 16th century onward, political power in France concentrated around the throne at the expense of the once-prominent aristocracy. The French dukes and counts seen in Shakespeare&rsquo;s history plays, which depict medieval Europe, are powerful warlords who can make or unmake the monarchy through their support or opposition. But by the mid-17th century, when Louis XIV (1638â€“1715) reached adulthood, this state of affairs no longer existed. Known as the Sun King, Louis XIV brought France to the height of absolute monarchy by making the nobility even more dependent on himself. Aristocrats competing for the king&rsquo;s favor further consolidated his position as the center of the French courtâ€”the sun to their solar system.</p><p>From the mid-17th century onward, monarchy in France remained an absolute institution, and the laws reflected the special majesty of the monarch. When Foucault recounts the grisly 1757 execution of Robert-FranÃ§ois Damiens inÂ 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Discipline-and-Punish-The-Birth-of-the-Prison/part-1-chapter-1-summary/ rel=noopener>Part 1, Chapter 1</a>Â he is describing a form of punishment that epitomized theÂ <em>ancien</em>Â <em>rÃ©gime</em>Â at its height. Under this political system, no crime was judged more horrific than regicideâ€”murdering, or attempting to murder, the king. Even though Damiens did not succeed in his attempt to assassinate King Louis XV (1710â€“74), he was sentenced to the most painful form of execution the French authorities could devise. He was tortured, drawn (tied to a horse and dragged), and quartered (horses and ropes were used to pull his body apart), and then his torso was burned.</p><p>Things changed toward the end of the 18th century. Louis XV was the next-to-last monarch to occupy the French throne before the outbreak of the Revolution. The prestige of the monarchy declined drastically under Louis XV, lending a tinge of dramatic irony to his early title: &ldquo;Louis the Beloved.&rdquo; Ill-suited to the task of governing, he gradually came to be despised by his subjects, not least because of his poor management of the country&rsquo;s finances. When Louis XVI (1754â€“93), the grandson of Louis XV, ascended the throne in 1774, he inherited his grandfather&rsquo;s problems, which were compounded by food shortages and a sovereign debt crisis.</p><a href=#revolution-and-the-napoleonic-years><h4 id=revolution-and-the-napoleonic-years><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Revolution and the Napoleonic Years</h4></a><p>On July 14, 1789, amid growing unrest, a group of Parisian rioters stormed the Bastilleâ€”an event now generally regarded as the start of the French Revolution (1789â€“99). As the uprising swept across rural areas, French aristocrats fled the country. The National Assembly, which gained power as the monarchy and nobility lost their hold on the nation, ratified the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in August 1789, followed by a constitution in 1791. More radical revolutionaries took control in 1792, and their ascendancy led to the execution of Louis XVI in 1793. The radicals consolidated their influence under an organization known as the Committee of Public Safety but ceded power in 1795 when their conservative counterparts secured legislative office. This regime, known as the Directory, lasted until 1799.</p><p>As its leadership began to quarrel, the Directory grew unstable, and the military came to enjoy greater and greater power in French politics. In 1799, seizing an opportunity created by worse-than-usual infighting in the Directory, the general Napoleon Bonaparte (1769â€“1821) declared himself a consulâ€”in effect, a military dictator. By the end of 1804 he had crowned himself emperor. Until about 1810 Napoleon maintained a firm grip on the throne through largely successful wars of aggression. In 1812, however, he undertook a disastrous campaign in Russia, losing hundreds of thousands of troops to cold, hunger, and desertion. By 1814 France was on the defensive as its enemies banded together and demanded the overthrow of the emperor. Napoleon&rsquo;s disillusioned followers complied, exiling him to the island of Elba.</p><a href=#the-bourbon-restoration-and-the-july-monarchy><h4 id=the-bourbon-restoration-and-the-july-monarchy><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Bourbon Restoration and the July Monarchy</h4></a><p>Napoleon managed to escape this first banishment but was exiled a second and final time after his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo (1815). Rather than revert to a republic, however, France continued as a monarchy first under the conservative Bourbon dynasty (the Bourbon Restoration, 1814â€“30), and then under the more liberal Louis-Philippe, who headed the July Monarchy (1830â€“48). Another revolution, in February 1848, ushered in a short-lived Second Republic (1848â€“52), which in turn gave way to the Second Empire (1852â€“70). By this point, the reforms Foucault identifies as part of the modern penal system had largely been accomplished.</p><a href=#penal-reform-in-france-and-abroad><h2 id=penal-reform-in-france-and-abroad><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Penal Reform in France and Abroad</h2></a><p>Foucault&rsquo;s main focal point inÂ <em>Discipline and Punish</em>Â is the series of penal reforms that took place in France at the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th. These reforms went hand in hand with the dramatic regime changes France underwent during those years. The French Revolution, for example, is oftenâ€”and rightlyâ€”regarded as a violent era politically, but it was also the scene of a revolution in thinking about crime and punishment. The guillotine, now infamous as a symbol of politically motivated killings, was originally invented as a more humane alternative to the gruesome and unpredictable modes of execution used earlier. Before 1792, when the guillotine was formally adopted, there existed a hierarchy of capital punishments that depended on the social status of the offender and the nature of the offense. Common murderers were hanged, whereas noblemen were beheaded. In principle, both methods killed the victim instantly, but many executions were botched, with horrific results. By adopting the guillotine for king and commoner alike, the revolutionaries voted in favor of a streamlined, even mechanized, mode of penal justice that acknowledged no difference of rank.</p><p>The French Penal Code of 1810, instituted under Napoleon, is in some ways a step backward from pre-Revolutionary idealism. It codified, or arranged systematically, a large category of crimes against the state and revived the practice of branding criminals for later identification. In Foucault&rsquo;s study, the 1810 code is important because it introduced some aspects of the modern penal system and underscored others already in place. By giving a prominent position to imprisonment, making it the prescribed punishment for most noncapital offenses, the Code signaled the failure of the more complicated systems of punishment envisioned by 18th-century reformers. The code also formalized the idea of continual surveillance for convicted felons, thus erecting a pillar of the system of &ldquo;delinquency&rdquo; Foucault discusses in Part 4. Though amended over the years, the 1810 Code remained the basic criminal law in France until the end of the 20th century.</p><p>Another wave of changes in penal practice came about during the July Monarchy (1830â€“48), when King Louis-Philippe tried to restore popular trust in the monarchy by entertaining liberal reforms. Among these changes were the abolition of the chain gang and the establishment of juvenile detention centers. Until 1837 prisoners were transported from place to place through a forced march, chained together at the neck to prevent escape, and until 1840 juvenile offenders were placed in the same facilities as adults. Both of these reforms, in Foucault&rsquo;s view, brought France closer to the modern carceral system, in which prison is the center of penal practice. Abolishing the chain gang, Foucault argues, essentially meant plugging a gap in the carceral system because prisoners were no longer openly on display during transportation. Similarly, instituting a separate system of juvenile corrections extended the reach of the carceral system by creating a place for petty underage offenders who might otherwise have slipped through the net.</p><p>Although Foucault refers primarily to French penal history,Â <em>Discipline and Punish</em>Â also contains comparisons to systems in England, the United States, and elsewhere. The penal history of England is noteworthy because, from a relatively early date (the late 17th century), criminal trials were held in the open before a jury. The secret trials still practiced in France at that time were criticized by French pamphleteers and journalists who wanted a penal system more like England&rsquo;s. This difference reflected the differing balance of political power in the two countries. By 1700 France was well on its way to the absolute monarchy typified by Louis XIV, whereas England was on its way, in the other direction, to constitutional monarchy. On the other hand, prisons in the early United States borrowed from, and in some ways refined, the French and English models. Thus, much of what Foucault says about the carceral system can be applied not only to France but throughout modern Western nations.</p><a href=#power-and-knowledge><h2 id=power-and-knowledge><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Power and Knowledge</h2></a><p>The idea that &ldquo;knowledge is power&rdquo; is a common enough sentiment, but for Foucault the relationship between the two is more complex. One key insight inÂ <em>Discipline and Punish</em>Â is that powerÂ <em>creates</em>Â knowledge: both specific pieces of knowledge and categories of what can be known. With the rise of disciplinary institutions in general (discussed in Part 3) and prisons in particular (discussed in Part 4), individuals become &ldquo;knowable&rdquo; in ways they previously were not. Disciplineâ€”in schools, at work, in the hospitalâ€”makes it possible to build a &ldquo;case&rdquo; or dossier on each individual. Prisons take this discipline to an extreme and thus produce especially detailed and comprehensive forms of knowledge about their subjects. Under the old medieval system of justice, Foucault points out, there is little to know about offenders except whether they committed the crime in question. In the modern system, however, an offender&rsquo;s beliefs, desires, and attitudes are all subjects for observation and record keeping. Psychologists and wardensâ€”along with, later, parole officers and the policeâ€”all collaborate in monitoring prisoners and gathering information. The power of the prison system manifests itself in its ability to turn each inmate into an open book.</p><p>The relationship between power and knowledge is a central concern of Foucault&rsquo;s not only inÂ <em>Discipline and Punish</em>Â but throughout his works. InÂ <em>Madness and Civilization: A History of Insanity in the Age of Reason</em>Â (1961), he discusses the rise of a system in which the mentally ill were sequestered from society in special institutions. To accomplish their dual project of curing and confining the &ldquo;madman,&rdquo; these institutions needed to develop a body of knowledge, both of madness in general and of each mentally ill individual. InÂ <em>The Birth of the Clinic</em>Â (1963), Foucault discusses the origin of the &ldquo;medical gaze,&rdquo; the privileged way doctors and hospitals &ldquo;look at&rdquo; a patient&rsquo;s body to extract knowledge.Â <em>The Archaeology of Knowledge</em>Â (1969) generalizes Foucault&rsquo;s earlier projects by discussing the ways in which knowledge itself is defined and developed within specific &ldquo;discourses,&rdquo; of which the discourses surrounding medicine and mental illness are examples. His multi-volumeÂ <em>History of Sexuality</em>, left unfinished upon his death in 1984, is also</p><p>concerned with the reciprocal relationship between knowledge and power. In it, Foucault describes the emergence of sexuality as an object of knowledge from religious, ethical, and demographic perspectives. As in his previous works on madness, medicine, and the prison system, Foucault treats the very terms in which sexuality is discussed as the product of a power relation. He argues, for example, that the tendency to categorize people according to their sexuality (heterosexual, homosexual, etc.) reflects a societal effort to regulate and control sexual behavior.</p><hr><a href=#summary><h1 id=summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-1><h2 id=summary-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><a href=#part-1-torture><h3 id=part-1-torture><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 1: Torture</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Discipline-and-Punish-The-Birth-of-the-Prison/author/ rel=noopener>Foucault</a>Â begins his &ldquo;history of the prison&rdquo; by describing, in broad strokes, society&rsquo;s shift from torture and execution to imprisonment as a major form of punishment. This transition, he says, took place gradually over the course of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. It was driven by a host of economic, social, and political forcesâ€”many of them far removed from the ordinary workings of the court system. In the broadest sense, penal practices went from punishing the body to punishing the &ldquo;soul&rdquo; of the offender. A medical model of penal discipline has arisen, Foucault argues, in which the avowed goal is to cure or rehabilitate criminals rather than to make them suffer. The successes and failures of this model are a frequent subject in later parts of the book.</p><p>First, however, Foucault sketches out the characteristics of European (specifically, French) penal practices before the rise of the prison system. In the 17th century and into the 18th, public torture and execution were still practiced, though not as commonly as one might think. These penalties were part of a justice system in which trials were secretive affairs and &ldquo;proof&rdquo; was often extorted from the accused by force or fraud. The fundamental rationale for such a system, Foucault suggests, is that crimes offended the monarch (or later, society) as the author and maintainer of the laws. More than the immediate victim of the offense, the monarch had a right to seek revenge for this affront. Burnings at the stake and other gruesome punishments were a way for the &ldquo;injured sovereignty&rdquo; to reestablish itself and prove its absolute dominance over individual subjects. Ultimately, however, public executions were deemed too unruly and hazardous, not least because crowds at such executions sometimes turned against the authorities. Creating a sense of bloodthirstiness in the masses came to be seen as bad policy.</p><a href=#part-2-punishment><h3 id=part-2-punishment><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 2: Punishment</h3></a><p>At the end of the 18th century and into the beginning of the 19th, public executions came under fire and new, more humane, punishments were sought. Urbanization and industrialization led to the concentration of wealth and made the middle and upper classes more interested in using the legal system to protect their property. Violent crimes diminished, and property crimes, like theft and fraud, became more common. Penal reformers of this era wanted a justice system that could deter such crimes and at the same time prevent the excesses witnessed under the old system. Several influential thinkers called for a system of &ldquo;analogical punishment[s]&rdquo; in which penalties were closely related to, and even reminiscent of, the crimes committed. So, for example, those whose crimes stemmed from laziness would be sentenced to hard labor, and those whose crimes arose from greed would be fined or have their goods confiscated.</p><p>The reformers had several requirements for their new system of penal justice. Punishments were to be just severe enough to outweigh the advantages of crime and make it unattractive. Their efficacy was to be judged mainly by their ability to deter others from committing crime, rather than by their effect on the criminal. In effect, convicts were to serve as a &ldquo;book&rdquo; in which upright citizens could &ldquo;read&rdquo; the law and be dissuaded from breaking it. Moreover, the law was to deal out penalties with precision, prescribing a specific sentence for each type of crime. It was also to take aggravating or extenuating circumstances into account. Guilt and innocence were no longer to be established by the strange, complicated rules of medieval justice. Rather, the same kinds of reasoning used in nonjudicial settings were to be applied within the courtroom.</p><p>Despite its popularity among theorists, the &ldquo;analogical punishment&rdquo; system never really took off. Instead, by about 1810, imprisonment and other types of detention came to fill the space between fines (for light crimes) and execution (now reserved for the gravest offenses). To Foucault, this is a remarkable development and demands an explanation. How did imprisonment, previously an unpopular and widely criticized mode of punishment, become the central feature of the modern penal system?</p><a href=#part-3-discipline><h3 id=part-3-discipline><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 3: Discipline</h3></a><p>To explain this change, Foucault turns his focus to other societal institutions, such as military units and schools. These, he says, were evolving at the same time as prisons were coming to be seen as a viable mode of punishment. Within these other institutions, a system of disciplineâ€”fine-grained control and supervisionâ€”was taking shape. Present in only a rudimentary form at the end of the 17th century, discipline in the modern sense was becoming a pervasive social force by the beginning of the 19th century. Armies drilled their soldiers in even the smallest-scale movements, schoolchildren sat at assigned desks and followed a strict timetable, and factories divided their labor forces with scrupulous precision.</p><p>The rise of discipline led to several transformations whose echoes can be seen in the modern prison system. Disciplinary institutions typically were enclosed sites in which each individual had a particular place, and each place and time corresponded to a particular task. Such sites were modular, with a cell, desk, or hospital bed being occupied by a newcomer after its old occupant had left. Behavior, too, was controlled by breaking it up into finer and finer timescales, with the goal of extracting the maximum productivity from a given unit of time. Eventually, elaborate disciplinary systems arose, which could account, in precise detail, for substantial portions of an individual&rsquo;s life.</p><p>Such discipline was maintained and enforced by using a variety of tactics, which Foucault organizes under the headings of observation and judgment. For example, students, soldiers, and patients were increasingly subject to a system of hierarchical observation. In armies, a junior officer would observe his troops and report upward to a superior officer, whose duties included observing the junior officer. Another key to the rise of disciplinary institutions was their practice of normalizing judgment, of making all members subject to punishment or reward for even slight deviations below (or above) normal behavior. The examination, a category including not just the classroom exam but also the psychiatric evaluation and the military drill, became a tool for cementing this structure of observation and judgment.</p><p>For Foucault, the result of this process is exemplified by the panopticon, an architectural idea developed by English philosopher Jeremy Bentham (1748â€“1832). Intended as a template for building prisons, schools, workplaces, and other sites of surveillance, the panopticon consisted of a central tower surrounded by a ring of cells. The cells would be walled off from each other, but those in the central tower would be able to observe any inmate at any time without being seen themselves. In Foucault&rsquo;s view, this &ldquo;panoptic&rdquo; state of alwaysâ€”potentiallyâ€”being watched is characteristic of modern life. In such a &ldquo;disciplinary society,&rdquo; prisons were not as unusual a mode of punishment as they might seem.</p><a href=#part-4-prison><h3 id=part-4-prison><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 4: Prison</h3></a><p>Using the discussion of discipline as a backdrop, Foucault explains the rise of the prison system. The prison, he says, seems &ldquo;natural&rdquo; because it resembles the other disciplinary systems, such as schools and factories, that emerged in the 18th and 19th centuries. The distinctive characteristics of prisonsâ€”isolation, forced labor, and a complicated internal scheme of rewards and punishmentsâ€”all are found in other social institutions. In a sense, prisons are the sum total of disciplinary institutions because a single authorityâ€”the prison administrationâ€”is responsible for education, medical treatment, and labor management. The self-contained nature of prisons has led to the formation of a system Foucault calls the &ldquo;carceral,&rdquo; which opposes itself to the rest of the judicial system and extends its reach throughout society.</p><p>Since their inception, Foucault observes, prisons have been subjects of calls for reform. Such criticisms generally include the claim that prisons do not prevent crime and may even increase it by producing repeat offenders. This seeming failure, Foucault says, actually stems from a misunderstanding of what prisons accomplish. Their societal roleâ€”if not necessarily their stated missionâ€”is not to eliminate crime but to produce &ldquo;delinquents.&rdquo; Delinquency, he explains, is &ldquo;a politically or economically less dangerousâ€”and, on occasion, usableâ€”form of illegality&rdquo; and thus to be preferred to more disruptive types of crime. Therefore, the manufacturing of delinquents is in some ways a success because it creates a group of people who can be easily monitored and manipulated by the dominant classes.</p><p>The mid-19th century, Foucault suggests, represented the completion of the modern carceral system. By this point, imprisonment was firmly established as the primary means of punishment for criminals, and new types of carceral institutions, such as juvenile detention centers, had begun to emerge. As carceral principles radiated into other areas of society, such as orphanages and almshouses, it became possible for a person to have an entire &ldquo;career&rdquo; living in one or another such institution. Another consequence of the spread of carceral systems was that punishing and judging came to seem &ldquo;natural and legitimate&rdquo; in many areas of private and public life. No longer merely the privilege of the courts, punishment and judgment are tools wielded by doctors, teachers, social workers, and many others. The endpoint of this transformation is a &ldquo;carceral society&rdquo; in which the distinction between prison and the outside world is very slight indeed.</p><hr><a href=#part-1-chapter-1--torture-the-body-of-the-condemned--summary><h1 id=part-1-chapter-1--torture-the-body-of-the-condemned--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 1, Chapter 1 : Torture (The Body of the Condemned) | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-2><h2 id=summary-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Discipline-and-Punish-The-Birth-of-the-Prison/author/ rel=noopener>Foucault</a>Â begins his &ldquo;history of the prison&rdquo; by comparing two sets of documents. One set, from 1757, describes the public torture and execution of a prisoner, named Damiens, for the attempted murder of the king. The other, from the 1830s, is the timetable describing the daily schedule of prisoners in one Paris institution. Noting the contrast between the two, Foucault asks this question: How did society transition from a system of public, spectacular punishments to a system based on incarceration? What happened to the &ldquo;gloomy festival[s] of punishment&rdquo; common in the 18th century but rare by the end of the 19th? Why did torture disappear as a &ldquo;public spectacle&rdquo;? One way of explaining the change, he says, is that the justice system grew &ldquo;ashamed&rdquo; of penal practices in general: &ldquo;there is no glory in punishing.&rdquo;</p><p>The shift from public executions to a prison-centered penal system is, Foucault asserts, a shift from punishing the body to punishing the &ldquo;soul.&rdquo; Physical pain is incidental to modern penal practices rather than the main element of those practices. Yet, he argues, the change goes deeper than a simple effort to be less cruel and more humane. In modern penal systems, it is theÂ <em>offenders</em>Â who are judgedâ€”their desires, drives, wishes, and inclinationsâ€”rather than theÂ <em>offenses</em>Â they commit. As evidence, Foucault points to the modern concept ofÂ <em>extenuating circumstances</em>, factors that make a person less responsible for a crime and therefore less liable to be punished. Judgments about a person&rsquo;s sanity and state of mind now routinely enter into criminal proceedings.</p><p>The net effect, Foucault argues, is a system of punishment concerned with rehabilitating, or even &ldquo;curing,&rdquo; offenders of the predispositions that led them to commit crimes. A rise in leniency has accompanied a change in the goal of the penal system. Studying these developments in detail, he proposes, will lead to a better understanding of the power dynamics that pervade modern society. It also may help explain the origins of modern prison revoltsâ€”including those that had recently broken out in France whenÂ <em>Discipline and Punish</em>Â was published.</p><a href=#analysis><h2 id=analysis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p>In this chapterÂ 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Discipline-and-Punish-The-Birth-of-the-Prison/author/ rel=noopener>Foucault</a>Â lays the ground rules for his study. Several of these rules are reversals of commonly held beliefs about punishment, justice, and society. Punishment, Foucault argues, is not just a way of repressing crime or even of subjugating a particular class of citizens: it is a &ldquo;complex social function&rdquo; that changes the way &ldquo;crime&rdquo; and &ldquo;criminals&rdquo; are viewed. Moreover, Foucault sees punishmentâ€”and specific techniques of punishmentâ€”as inherently political, rather than neutral. The way a society punishes certain people or certain acts is, for Foucault, a window into the society&rsquo;s values and power structures. This applies to the modern, &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; paradigm of punishment just as it does to the medieval torture-and-execution paradigm. Finally,Â <em>Discipline and Punish</em>Â is predicated on the notion that the soul, and not just the body, can be addressed by punishment. Foucault&rsquo;s startling assertion that &ldquo;the soul is the prison of the body&rdquo; foreshadows his later claim that the current prison-driven penal system is, in some ways, more repressive than the system it replaces.</p><p>Toward the end of the chapter, Foucault refers to the writings of German-born historian Ernst Kantorowicz (1895â€“1963), best known for his workÂ <em>The King&rsquo;s Two Bodies</em>Â (1957). Although Foucault mentions the book only in passing, its ideas shed considerable light on the discussion of sovereignty and power throughout Part 1. The core thesis of Kantorowicz&rsquo;s work is that medieval kings were legally and religiously regarded as having &ldquo;two bodies&rdquo;: aÂ <em>natural body</em>Â that eventually ages and dies and a secondÂ <em>spiritual body</em>Â that kings possess because they are kings. The expression &ldquo;The king is dead. Long live the king&rdquo; acknowledges the transience of the king&rsquo;s natural body while suggesting something survives between the reigns of individual rulers. Kantorowicz labels this &ldquo;something&rdquo; the spiritual body.</p><p>For Foucault, Kantorowicz&rsquo;s theory offers a way of understanding not only the special reverence accorded to the king&rsquo;s physical person but also the unique horror with which crimes against the king&rsquo;s body were viewed. On the &ldquo;two bodies&rdquo; theory, the prisoner Damiens, in slashing King Louis XV with a knife, did not merely injure the physical body of a (particularly powerful) man. Damiens also violated the spiritual body of the French kingâ€”violating, in a sense, the monarchy itself. Thus he was convicted and sentenced not just as someone who had attempted murder but as a regicide or &ldquo;king-killer.&rdquo; Murderers, who killed only an ordinary body, were hanged, whereas regicides were drawn and quartered in the disturbing, protracted process Foucault describes. This &ldquo;two bodies&rdquo; concept also provides a basis for the criminalizationâ€”in early modern France and in some countries to this dayâ€”ofÂ <em>lÃ¨se-majestÃ©</em>Â or &ldquo;injured majesty.&rdquo; According to the &ldquo;two-body&rdquo; theory, insulting a monarch is considered a crime because the monarch is, or embodies, more than a mere individual.</p><p>This theory also provides Foucault with a way to make sense of the special, if unenviable, status of a condemned criminal. The body of the condemned, like the body of a king, is the subject of special ceremonies and rituals. In a system that regards a monarch as more than a man, with more than an ordinary body, it is not much of a stretch to treat the convict as less than a human and the convict&rsquo;s body as less than an ordinary body.</p><hr><a href=#part-1-chapter-2--torture-the-spectacle-of-the-scaffold--summary><h1 id=part-1-chapter-2--torture-the-spectacle-of-the-scaffold--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 1, Chapter 2 : Torture (The Spectacle of the Scaffold) | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-3><h2 id=summary-3><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p>This chapter recounts the penal practices of the 17th and 18th centuries, including public torture and execution.

<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Discipline-and-Punish-The-Birth-of-the-Prison/author/ rel=noopener>Foucault</a>Â says such punishments were in fact relatively rare. Most offenders were simply banished or fined. Capital punishments themselves ran a gamut from quick and relatively painless (decapitation) to excruciating and prolonged (drawing and quartering). The type and extent of torture were carefully codified according to the nature of the offense and the rank of the offender.</p><p>Criminal justice proceedings in France were conducted secretly, well into the modern era. A complicated system of proofs and half-proofs was used to establish guilt, with a confession constituting valuable, but not absolute, evidence. Because of the clarity confessions brought to judicial proceedings, prosecutors often aggressively sought them and in some cases tortured the accused to obtain them. An unusual feature of this early system was the concept of partial guilt: a person deemed likely to have committed a crime would be given a lesser punishment, not acquitted. &ldquo;Innocent until proven guilty&rdquo; is a modern development. Other aspects of the &ldquo;torture and execution&rdquo; era illustrate the distinction between crime and criminal. One was theÂ <em>amende honorable</em>, a forced confession of and humiliating apology for one&rsquo;s crime. Another was the tendency for the costume of the condemned, or the mode of execution, to symbolize the crime being punished.</p><p>In understanding the theatrics of public punishment, Foucault says, it helps to understand the way &ldquo;offenses&rdquo; were understood in that era. Criminals were viewed as having offended not only their immediate victims, but also society andâ€”more importantlyâ€”the monarch, whose laws were violated. Public executions, in all their gratuitousness, were a way for the &ldquo;injured sovereignty&rdquo; of the monarch to reestablish itself as dominant over the criminal. The total humiliation and destruction of the condemned was a &ldquo;triumph of the law&rdquo; over its enemiesâ€”hence the especially grisly punishments meted out to those who killed, or tried to kill, the king. When monarchism began to wane, society as a whole took over the status of the offended party seeking revenge, and the system of tortures and executions continued for a time.</p><p>Why did public executions ultimately give way to incarceration? Foucault cites the ambiguous, often violent, reaction of crowds as one reason such executions were abolished. Onlookers would sometimes storm the scaffold to rescue the condemned, suggesting the government was not really in control. A similar ambiguity, Foucault says, exists in the &ldquo;literature of crime&rdquo; which arose around the same time. As the decades passed, popular fiction was increasingly apt to celebrate crimes as daring and not condemn them as immoral.</p><a href=#analysis-1><h2 id=analysis-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p>In this chapterÂ 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Discipline-and-Punish-The-Birth-of-the-Prison/author/ rel=noopener>Foucault</a>Â goes into greater detail concerning the role ofÂ <em>lÃ¨se-majestÃ©</em>Â (&ldquo;injured majesty&rdquo;) in early modern penal justice. The concept of majesty suggested in Chapter 1â€”a monarch who is more than a mere personâ€”goes some way toward explaining why the law regarded any kind of crime as, in part, an affront to the sovereign. As the embodiment of the law, the theory goes, the monarch could justly claim to be injured by any violation of the law, whether or not the violation seemed to affect the king personally. Kantorowicz&rsquo;s &ldquo;two bodies&rdquo; concept offers another way of framing it: as a natural human being, the king does not suffer direct injury if one of his subjects is robbed or assaulted. His &ldquo;natural body,&rdquo; in Kantorowicz&rsquo;s terms, is unharmed. However,Â <em>in his capacity as a monarch</em>, the king is injured any time the laws are injured. His &ldquo;spiritual body&rdquo; is affronted, providing a basis for the revenge of the law.</p><p>Interestingly, similar ideas have recurred in Christian apologetics, the practice of answering theological questions by using reason and logic. In one sense, this recurrence is not surprising, since traditional theories of monarchy rest on the assumption the king is God&rsquo;s appointed representative on earthâ€”the so-called &ldquo;divine right of kings.&rdquo; An idea similar toÂ <em>lÃ¨se-majestÃ©</em>Â has been used, for example, to explain why a benevolent God would create such a place as hell. Skeptics argue that hell, as a place of eternal suffering, is an unjust punishment for sins that are necessarily finite. The traditional response is that although sins in themselves may be finite acts, they are sins against God, who is infinitely good. To reduce it to crude mathematical terms, the gravity of the offense is &ldquo;multiplied&rdquo; by the goodness of the person offended (in this case, God). Thus, the apologist argues, it would be a violation of divine justice for hellÂ <em>not</em>Â to exist, because justice requires those who offend infinitely to be punished infinitely. Likewise, in the Western monarchical system, the gravity of the crime (attempted murder) is &ldquo;multiplied&rdquo; by the majesty of the person whose life is threatened.</p><p>Some of the crime literature Foucault mentions, though popular in its day, likely seems obscure now. The main point of Foucault&rsquo;s catalog is to show changes inÂ <em>how</em>Â crime was viewed by the authors, who encouraged their readers to take a similar perspective. Initially, Foucault points out, crime literature took the form of supposed confessions in which convicts offered themselves as moral examples for the benefit of others. In such confessional literature, for instance, a condemned robber might urge parents to discipline their children so that they don&rsquo;t grow up to suffer the same fate. Foucault does not set much store by the authenticity of these accounts, whose language he sees as too moralistic to be plausible. Moreover, much like modern youth education initiativesâ€”for example, the Drug Abuse Resistance Education program (D.A.R.E.) in which members pledge not to use drugsâ€”the success of these anti-crime broadsheets and pamphlets appears to have been limited and might even have backfired in some respects. French authorities&rsquo; attempts to get the citizenry to &ldquo;Just Say No&rdquo; to crime did not necessarily produce more criminals, but in the long run it didn&rsquo;t turn popular sentiment against criminals either.</p><hr><a href=#part-2-chapter-1--punishment-generalized-punishment--summary><h1 id=part-2-chapter-1--punishment-generalized-punishment--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 2, Chapter 1 : Punishment (Generalized Punishment) | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-4><h2 id=summary-4><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p>Toward the end of the 18th century, public executions were increasingly criticized as cruel and excessive. A new, more humane mode of punishment was sought, and for a time it was unclear what direction these new punishments might take. At the same time, the nature of crime shifted fundamentally, with fewer violent crimes and more of what would now be called &ldquo;property crimes.&rdquo; Large bands of brigandsâ€”robbers who generally operated in forests or sparsely populated rural areasâ€”were replaced by criminals working alone or in small, highly coordinated groups.Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Discipline-and-Punish-The-Birth-of-the-Prison/author/ rel=noopener>Foucault</a>Â describes the shift as one &ldquo;from a criminality of blood to a criminality of fraud.&rdquo; The industrialization of society and the concentration of wealth in cities meant these crimes of fraud were noticed and resented by the rich.</p><p>Caught up in these developments, many turn-of-the-century reformers demanded a system of criminal justice that could deter theft and other property crimes. The courts would have to be overhauled, that is, streamlined and normalized to prevent abuses by rulers, judges, or defendants. Punishments, too, would have to changeâ€”but the nature of this change was a matter of fierce debate. Some advocated a penal system in which each crime had a closely related penalty, which would serve as a deterrent to like-minded individuals.</p><p>Foucault identifies several rules according to which this theory of punishment operated, giving a descriptive name to each.</p><ul><li>TheÂ <strong>rule of minimum quantity</strong>Â holds that a punishment should confer a disadvantage just slightly greater than the advantage to be gained by committing the crime.</li><li>TheÂ <strong>rule of sufficient ideality</strong>Â holds that punishments derive their usefulness from the ideas they instill, not from the harm they inflict.</li><li>TheÂ <strong>rule of lateral effects</strong>, related to the rule of sufficient ideality, holds that a punishment should be judged by its effect on those who doÂ <em>not</em>Â commit the crime and are deterred from doing so.</li><li>TheÂ <strong>rule of perfect certainty</strong>Â asserts a precise link between each crime and the corresponding penalty: punishments must be unambiguous, and criminals must have no hope of escaping them.</li><li>TheÂ <strong>rule of common truth</strong>Â means a criminal&rsquo;s guilt must be established by using the same kinds of reasoning used in non-judicial settings.</li><li>TheÂ <strong>rule of optimal specification</strong>Â requires the law to cover all offenses and provide for all types of cases.</li></ul><a href=#analysis-2><h2 id=analysis-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p>The set of rulesÂ 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Discipline-and-Punish-The-Birth-of-the-Prison/author/ rel=noopener>Foucault</a>Â develops here does not come from any one reformer. Rather, it is a synthesis of the ideas of several reform advocates, among whom are the following men:</p><ul><li><strong>Beccaria</strong>Â is the Italian economist and criminologist Cesare Beccaria (1738â€“94). Born in Milan, he is best known for his 1764 essay &ldquo;On Crimes and Punishments,&rdquo; which informs much of Foucault&rsquo;s thinking concerning 18th-century penal reform. Beccaria&rsquo;s essay was widely read in its day and formed the basis for a lively discussion of penal reform not only in Italy but also in France and in the early United States. It contains the foundation for what Foucault calls theÂ <em>rule of minimum quantity</em>.</li><li><strong>Pastoret</strong>Â is Claude-Emmanuel de Pastoret (1755â€“1840), a French politician who managed to survive a dizzying array of regime changes. His main contribution to the discourse on criminal justice is theÂ <em>Treatise on Penal Law</em>Â (1790). In this work he calls for a total ban on the tortures practiced under theÂ <em>ancien rÃ©gime</em>, decrying them as barbaric. He also emphasizes the need for punishments to serve as rehabilitation rather than as mere deterrents or forms of state-sponsored revenge.</li><li><strong>Marat</strong>Â is Jean-Paul Marat (1743â€“93), perhaps the best known of the authors cited. One of the architects of the French Revolution, he set down his ideas concerning penal justice in his 1780Â <em>Plan for Criminal Legislation</em>. Among the more radical of the Revolution&rsquo;s leaders, he was popular among Parisians but was hatedâ€”and eventually assassinatedâ€”by the conservative Girondins.</li></ul><p>By and large, these figures are products of the Age of Enlightenment, the late 17th- and 18th-century philosophical movement, which sought to place reason and empiricism at the center of Europe&rsquo;s intellectual culture. Their writings, in each case, reveal an interest in a governmentâ€”including a penal systemâ€”founded on reason and improved through the gathering of data. Like many Enlightenment leaders, Beccaria and company are also representatives of the risingÂ <em>bourgeoisie</em>Â or middle class, whose increased economic power in the early modern period gave them a greater voice in Europe&rsquo;s political affairs. Thus, their calls for reform should not be assumed to come from a place of pure altruism or humanitarian concern. Less optimistically, their proposed reforms can also be seen as an effort on the part of the middle class to protect its property from the masses while also protecting itself from the whims of a dangerous monarch.</p><p>Some of the specific penal reforms advocated by Beccaria and company were eventually carried out, but the system of precisely interlocking crimes and punishments was never fully realized. As Foucault tells it, however, the rise of the modern prison system does owe one major debt to these Enlightenment-era figures: it draws on their collective dream of an efficient, almost mechanical system for extracting social value from criminals. One way of framing the narrative in Parts 2 and 3 is as the history of a debate: how does a &ldquo;rational&rdquo; penal system function?</p><hr><a href=#part-2-chapter-2--punishment-the-gentle-way-in-punishment--summary><h1 id=part-2-chapter-2--punishment-the-gentle-way-in-punishment--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 2, Chapter 2 : Punishment (The Gentle Way in Punishment) | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-5><h2 id=summary-5><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p>The theory of punishment outlined inÂ 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Discipline-and-Punish-The-Birth-of-the-Prison/part-2-chapter-1-summary/ rel=noopener>Part 2, Chapter 1</a>Â led to a short-lived, but historically significant, attempt to impose specific penalties for each kind of crime.Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Discipline-and-Punish-The-Birth-of-the-Prison/author/ rel=noopener>Foucault</a>Â describes this system after reviewing some of the rules from the previous chapter (for example, punishments must not seem arbitrary but must be closely linked, in the minds of the citizens, to the actual crimes). Penal reformers aimed to create such a system by imagining &ldquo;analogical punishments&rdquo; for each type of crime: fines for financial crimes, death for murderers, and so forth. Such punishments would be effective, the reformers argued, because they acted on the impulses that led people to crime in the first place. A lazy person would naturally fear forced labor, just as a greedy person would fear the confiscation of wealth or goods.</p><p>It was hoped such a system would also gradually reform criminals by instilling virtues opposite to their vices. It would be both wasteful and cruel to keep punishing a reformed criminal. Thus, punishments in this new system would have to be limited in duration, with the punishment itself lightening as the convict showed signs of reform. Like the old system of torture and executionâ€”though more humanelyâ€”this new system would provide a spectacle to dissuade the &ldquo;potentially guilty&rdquo; from crossing the line into criminality. In effect, those being punished would become an &ldquo;ever-open book&rdquo; in which other citizens could be reminded of the laws and the penalties for transgressing them.</p><p>At the end of the 18th century, then, a rich discourse surrounded the benefits of &ldquo;analogical punishments.&rdquo; However, by 1810, detention, including imprisonment, was the predominant punishment for any offense deemed too serious for a fine yet not grave enough for the death penalty. Foucault outlines the key features of this new detention-based system by describing a series of model prisons in England, the Netherlands, and the early United States. These prisons kept their inmates to a strict routine that included compulsory periods of work and education, followed by nightly isolation in individual cells. Prisoners in these institutions were under continual supervision, on the assumption that knowledge of the individual prisoner would assist in their reform and rehabilitation.</p><p>This shiftâ€”from one project of reform to anotherâ€”is remarkable because before the 19th century, imprisonment was unpopular and often criticized as an abuse of power by those who practiced it. How did this transformation happen? asks Foucault. How did imprisonmentâ€”&ldquo;the coercive, corporal, solitary, secret model of the power to punish&rdquo;â€”suddenly gain traction within society?</p><a href=#analysis-3><h2 id=analysis-3><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p>In the 21st century it is easy to take imprisonment for granted as a major feature of the penal system. Almost every country in the world now provides for some form of penal detention, so the use of prison time as a criminal sentence can easily seem like the &ldquo;default setting&rdquo; for modern society. The phrase &ldquo;if you can&rsquo;t do the time, don&rsquo;t do the crime&rdquo; captures the almost natural-seeming connection between crime and imprisonment.</p><p>However, at the end of the 18th century, it was a different story. Throughout theÂ <em>ancien rÃ©gime</em>â€”France&rsquo;s long era of absolute monarchyâ€”imprisonment served more as a political weapon than as a regularized means of punishment. The regime&rsquo;s political foes were sometimes imprisoned secretly without trial. With a document known as aÂ <em>lettre de cachet</em>, the king could condemn an individual to indefinite imprisonment with no means of appeal. Only the king could cancel such a letter, making it, in effect, a sort of anti-pardon. In fact, both lettres de cachet and royal pardons were among the abuses and irregularities against which turn-of-the-century reformers campaigned. The Bastille, the fortress-prison stormed at the outset of the Revolution in July 1789, was a place to which someone could receive a life sentence simply by displeasing the king.</p><p>Meanwhile, on the national level, little recourse existed for people who were arrested or imprisoned without just cause, whether by the king or by some lesser authority. The legal concept of habeas corpus was not formalized in France until 1789, when the Declaration of the Rights of Man affirmed, &ldquo;no person shall be &mldr; imprisoned except in the cases and according to the forms prescribed by law.&rdquo; The fact that the French revolutionaries explicitly mentioned arbitrary imprisonment in their Declaration indicates it was, if not widespread in practice, at least widely feared and despised. Thus, advocates of imprisonment as a penalty faced a difficult public-relations battle in convincing the public their system would be different. Their success was remarkable enough to merit the lengthy explanationÂ 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Discipline-and-Punish-The-Birth-of-the-Prison/author/ rel=noopener>Foucault</a>Â provides in Parts 3 and 4.</p><p>In this chapter, however, Foucault plants the seeds of a related question:Â <em>why</em>Â was prison adopted/accepted by those in power as a legitimate mode of punishment? His answer is grounded in the changing class politics of early modern Europe. Coming out of the Revolution, Foucault suggests, the middle class orÂ <em>bourgeoisie</em>Â sought to consolidate its power in a way that defended it against threats both from above (monarchy) and below (the masses). The prison system, as pioneered in the American and Dutch models, allowed for the middle class to establish itself as a saner, more humane governing force than the monarchy had been. It also offered a means for transforming the most stubborn parts of the lower classes into obedient subjects. The mechanisms by which this transformation was to be accomplished will be Foucault&rsquo;s main topic in Part 3 (<em>Discipline</em>).</p><hr><a href=#part-3-chapter-1--discipline-docile-bodies--summary><h1 id=part-3-chapter-1--discipline-docile-bodies--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 3, Chapter 1 : Discipline (Docile Bodies) | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-6><h2 id=summary-6><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p>To explain the sudden rise of the prison system,Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Discipline-and-Punish-The-Birth-of-the-Prison/author/ rel=noopener>Foucault</a>Â temporarily turns to other societal institutions. At the time prisons became commonplace, he says, disciplineâ€”fine-grained control and supervisionâ€”was also on the rise in military units, schools, and hospitals. Foucault says 17th-century armies were not very disciplined, whereas 19th-century ones were extensively trained in the minutest details of soldiership. Similarly, 17th-century workshops were relatively chaotic and unorganized, whereas 19th-century factories ran, at least ideally, like clockwork. Thus, during the period leading to the &ldquo;birth of the prison,&rdquo; there was an unprecedented and largely successful effort to regiment the activities of work, study, and warfare. Increased attention to detail and structure came to govern many areas of life.</p><a href=#the-art-of-distributions><h3 id=the-art-of-distributions><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Art of Distributions</h3></a><p>Foucault identifies several common characteristics of modern disciplinary institutionsâ€”barracks, hospitals, schools, and so forth. The first is &ldquo;enclosure&rdquo;: setting apart of physical spaces for specific purposes. Factories were walled and gated, and barracks were cut off from the surrounding town. Related to enclosure are these three concepts:</p><ul><li>partitioning: assigning each individual to a specific place</li><li>functional sites: assigning eachÂ <em>task</em>Â to a specific place</li><li>interchangeability: one group seamlessly replacing another at the end of each school year, class period, or shift.</li></ul><a href=#the-control-of-activity><h3 id=the-control-of-activity><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Control of Activity</h3></a><p>Also characteristic of disciplinary institutions are schemes for controlling people&rsquo;s activity. One example is the &ldquo;time-table,&rdquo; based originally on the strict schedules of monasteries and later promoted in schools and factories. Another is what Foucault calls the &ldquo;temporal elaboration of the act,&rdquo; or the breaking down of an action into finer and finer parts. Foucault gives the example of the increasingly precise specifications about how soldiers are to march. Disciplinary institutions also emphasized the &ldquo;correlation of the body and the gesture&rdquo;: the need for the entire body to be prepared to execute gestures, such as writing with ease and efficiency. The &ldquo;body-object articulation&rdquo; is a similar idea, applied to objects such as a pen or rifle. Finally, Foucault mentions the principle of &ldquo;exhaustive use&rdquo;: under a disciplinary system, time and actions are subdivided to wring as much productivity as possible out of a given hour or day.</p><a href=#the-organization-of-geneses><h3 id=the-organization-of-geneses><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Organization of Geneses</h3></a><p>Foucault next turns to the issue of how &ldquo;the disciplines&rdquo; came to structureâ€”or regulateâ€”long periods in a person&rsquo;s life. Foucault says the military accomplished a system of regimenting &ldquo;the relations of time, bodies, and forces&rdquo; by creating ranks through which young soldiers could expect to proceed, provided they had internalized the right kinds of discipline. Everyone, from the raw recruit to the officer to the aging veteran, had his place within the system formed by military training. Similarly, schools evolved a variety of classes and ranks to ensure the individual&rsquo;s time could always be spent &ldquo;profitabl[y].&rdquo;</p><a href=#the-composition-of-forces><h3 id=the-composition-of-forces><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Composition of Forces</h3></a><p>Finally, Foucault describes the way in which &ldquo;forces&rdquo; of societyâ€”epitomized, again, by the armyâ€”are formed from the individuals that discipline produces. Hierarchies and other forms of regimentation allowed for the creation of units that, at their best, functioned with an almost inhuman efficiency. Modern civilization, Foucault suggests, did not simply arise out of the Enlightenment-era emphasis on individual liberty. The &ldquo;military dream of society,&rdquo; in which individuals were &ldquo;meticulously subordinated cogs of a machine,&rdquo; also left its mark.</p><a href=#analysis-4><h2 id=analysis-4><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p>Most of the institutionsÂ 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Discipline-and-Punish-The-Birth-of-the-Prison/author/ rel=noopener>Foucault</a>Â cites as examples of discipline continue to work as they did in the period studied here. Armies are still organized according to a chain of command, and hospitals are still divided into wards and units. The class periods and assigned seating, considered innovative in the 1830s, are boringly familiar today. Moreover, all these institutions (the school, the hospital, the barracks) are well known from everyday life or popular culture. However, the monasteryâ€”the shared home of a community of monksâ€”may be less so. Foucault identifies monasteries as the prototypes for the disciplinary transformation of schools and workplaces, so it is important to understand how they functioned.</p><p>The monastic way of life is perhaps best known for its members&rsquo; vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. However, many more detailed rules typically govern monastic life, dividing the day into periods of prayer, work, and rest. The most influential set of such rules, called the Benedictine Rule, was developed by Saint Benedict of Nursia (c. 480â€“c. 547), who is generally viewed as the father of monasticism in Western Christianity. The singular wordÂ <em>rule</em>Â here might be misleading, for Benedict&rsquo;s prescriptions for communal life fill 73 chapters of varying lengths. Several aspects of the Rule are direct precursors to the kind of timetable-based system Foucault describes in French schools and prisons. For instance, Benedict stipulates specific hours for mealtimes, work, and daily prayers. Among the latter is the Divine Office, a round-the-clock schedule of prescribed prayers and scripture readings.</p><p>Monks observing the Benedictine Rule come together for meals and liturgies, but they spend much of their time in small individual rooms calledÂ <em>cells</em>, a word related to the modern EnglishÂ <em>cellar</em>. The termÂ <em>cell</em>Â first came to be used for monks&rsquo; quarters during the Middle Ages, and its meaning was extended to include the rooms of prison inmates in the 18th century. The monk&rsquo;s cell is also the origin of the termÂ <em>cell</em>Â as used in modern biology, because the cells of a plant resemble tiny, enclosed rooms when viewed under a low-power microscope.</p><p>In using the adjectiveÂ <em>cellular</em>Â to describe the individuality that emerges under discipline, Foucault likely has both the religious and the scientific meanings in mind. Discipline produces an individual who is, in some ways, walled off and isolated like a monk in a cell. The student has an assigned desk in an assigned room, the worker an assigned bench or station in the factory, the patient an assigned bed. If the quiet expected in these places is not exactly the silence of a monastery, it is similar compared with the bustle of public life.</p><p>The discussion of &ldquo;functional sites,&rdquo; however, draws on an idea of the &ldquo;cellular&rdquo; individual closer to biology than to monastery life. In the schools, factories, and barracks, which serve as Foucault&rsquo;s examples of discipline, an individual has a specific, defined function. As these institutions grow more sophisticated and extensive, the roles of &ldquo;cellular&rdquo; individuals differentiate like the tissues and organs of a complex organism.</p><hr><a href=#part-3-chapter-2--discipline-the-means-of-correct-training--summary><h1 id=part-3-chapter-2--discipline-the-means-of-correct-training--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Â Part 3, Chapter 2 : Discipline (The Means of Correct Training) | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-7><h2 id=summary-7><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p>Having described the basic rules and principles that govern disciplinary institutions,Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Discipline-and-Punish-The-Birth-of-the-Prison/author/ rel=noopener>Foucault</a>Â now examines the details of how such institutions operate.</p><a href=#hierarchical-observation><h3 id=hierarchical-observation><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Hierarchical Observation</h3></a><p>One mechanism of discipline is observation, which both the sites and the activities of disciplinary institutions are designed to facilitate. An army camp, for example, has all its tents laid out so that commanding officers can always monitor their soldiers&rsquo; activities. As discipline came to pervade society, Foucault asserts, the architecture of various spaces was reimagined &ldquo;to permit an internal, articulated, and detailed control&rdquo; of those within it. Hospitals were built to allow for observation of patients, isolation of contagious cases, and circulation of fresh air. Similarly, schools were built to precise architectural specifications to keep the students subject to constant monitoring. In all these places, a hierarchical scheme of observationâ€”a &ldquo;pyramid&rdquo; of officials observing downward and reporting upwardâ€”became commonplace.</p><a href=#normalizing-judgement><h3 id=normalizing-judgement><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Normalizing Judgement</h3></a><p>Another disciplinary tactic is the normalization of judgment. Schools, Foucault&rsquo;s main example here, gradually adopted a model of discipline in which students were routinely judged and punished even for minor infractions. Rather than an exception, judgmentâ€”about appearance, performance, and punctualityâ€”became the norm. Inability to carry out an assignment came to be judged in the same way as deliberate misbehavior. In both cases, the punishments chosen were corrective in nature, intended to &ldquo;reduc[e] gaps&rdquo; between low and high achievers. Meanwhile, positive judgments were also introduced, with accompanying rewards and privileges.</p><a href=#the-examination><h3 id=the-examination><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Examination</h3></a><p>Tied into the disciplinary aims of observation and judgment is the &ldquo;examination.&rdquo; Here Foucault means not only the regular examinations held in academic classes but also the medical examinations of patients and the drills conducted by soldiers. All such examinations, Foucault says, constitute &ldquo;a normalizing gaze, a surveillance that makes it possible to qualify, to classify, and to punish.&rdquo; Examinations, he asserts, turn knowledgeÂ <em>of</em>Â peopleâ€”students, soldiers, patientsâ€”into powerÂ <em>over</em>Â them. Examinations transform individuals into &ldquo;cases,&rdquo; complete with dossiers or records supporting further judgment and discipline.</p><a href=#analysis-5><h2 id=analysis-5><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p>This chapter is rich with detailed examples, but the central point should not be lost: disciplinary mechanisms, by their nature, expand to fill the vast space between the hardened felon and the model citizen. Rather than a simple, binary division of society, the disciplines at school, at work, and elsewhere create a fine gradation. Within this gradation, asÂ 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Discipline-and-Punish-The-Birth-of-the-Prison/author/ rel=noopener>Foucault</a>Â later points out, the transition from the worst non-criminal behavior to the slightest crime is almost imperceptible. Within the disciplinary society, there exist not only criminals and non-criminals, but almost-criminals and barely-criminals as well.</p><p>An examination, a court-martial, or a school disciplinary council meeting might, by itself, serve a distinct and relatively limited purpose. An exam in a high-school English class, for instance, might be conducted to determine whether students have readÂ <em>Macbeth</em>Â carefully enough to understand its plot, characters, and themes. In their totality, however, all the exams, along with all the other disciplinary rituals a person experiences, serve to accustom the person to the idea of discipline itself. Individuals become used to having their actions monitored, their skills assessed, and their shortcomings noted. In a society in which disciplinary mechanisms are pervasive, new applications of discipline are unlikely to seem strange.</p><p>The upshot, as will be seen in Part 4, is that prisons are not really an anomalous part of modern life, as Foucault tentatively proposes at the end of Part 2. They are not an innovation foisted on society by a small group of reformers as a humane alternative to branding or burning at the stake. Rather, prisons represent a point on the same continuum as schools, factories, and homeless shelters. They are, for Foucault, a feature of the same &ldquo;disciplinary society&rdquo; that assigns grades, military ranks, and disease-risk scores. Important to note is that Foucault is not claiming graded exams or medical assessments serveÂ <em>only</em>Â to discipline peopleâ€”that would be an oversimplification. Instead, he is saying that whatever else these systems accomplish, they also normalize the kinds of judgment and observation on which discipline as a whole depends.</p><hr><a href=#part-3-chapter-3--discipline-panopticism--summary><h1 id=part-3-chapter-3--discipline-panopticism--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 3, Chapter 3 : Discipline (Panopticism) | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-8><h2 id=summary-8><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Discipline-and-Punish-The-Birth-of-the-Prison/author/ rel=noopener>Foucault</a>Â begins this chapter by describing the elaborate practices of surveillance and isolation that were required whenever the plague broke out. Houses were locked, censuses taken, and necessary goods conveyed by pulleys to avoid close contact between persons. Violation of the rules of quarantine was punishable by death. This system, Foucault says, is like a prototype of the &ldquo;disciplinary projects&rdquo; discussed throughout Part 3. Rather than simple exclusion from society, like lepers in olden days, potential plague victims were &ldquo;segmented&rdquo; into groups and closely monitored.</p><p>The panopticon, an architectural concept developed by Jeremy Bentham, takes this segmentation to a further extreme. According to Bentham&rsquo;s vision, prisons, hospitals, and other sites of surveillance and isolation would be built as a central tower surrounded by a ring of cells. From the tower, a supervisor would be able to monitor activities in any of the cells without being seen. Moreover, the cells would isolate the inmates from each other, preventing escape plots or uprisings. The overall effect of the panopticon, Foucault says, is &ldquo;a state of conscious and permanent visibility that assures the automatic functioning of power.&rdquo; Because the prisoners (patients, students, etc.) can never be sure they areÂ <em>not</em>Â being watched, they come to behave as though they areÂ <em>always</em>Â being watched.</p><p>The concept of the panopticon, Foucault says, is important because it &ldquo;automatizes and dis individualizes power.&rdquo; Within it, power relations arise from the structure of the building itself, not from any special quality of the warden or teacher. In principle, Foucault observes, anyone could occupy the central tower with the same effect on the inmates. Moreover, he argues, although few actual buildings were constructed on Bentham&rsquo;s plan, the panopticon came to serve as a model for modern social institutions in general. The &ldquo;panoptic schema,&rdquo; as he calls it, represents a new type of power in which perpetual, often subtle, surveillance has replaced burdensome rules and regulations.</p><p>The spread of disciplinary institutions, panoptic or otherwise, has had several effects on society. Rather than simply preventing disorder or danger, discipline came to be seen as a method of increasing productivity. A &ldquo;swarming&rdquo; effect took place, in which disciplinary practices escaped their institutions and pervaded society as a whole. School authorities, for instance, became empowered to observe and admonish parents, in addition to children. Organizations working in the wider world, such as charity associations, further promoted the norms of discipline found in schools and workshops. Governments, too, got into the act by establishing police forces and intelligence agencies to surveil the population. The result is what Foucault terms a &ldquo;disciplinary society,&rdquo; capable of responding to the socio-economic conditions of the modern world. Individual disciplinary techniques, such as timetables, were not new at the beginning of the 19th century, but their combination into a vast, society-spanning system is a noteworthy development.</p><a href=#analysis-6><h2 id=analysis-6><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p>This chapter is perhaps the most memorable and widely cited in the entire book. HereÂ 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Discipline-and-Punish-The-Birth-of-the-Prison/author/ rel=noopener>Foucault</a>Â brings together ideas he has been elaborating throughout the past 200 pages and offers the reader a vivid image for understanding modern penal culture.</p><p>Though Jeremy Bentham described it in detail and popularized the concept, he was not the first person to propose a panopticon-like layout for places of observation and containment. Foucault himself compares Bentham&rsquo;s design to the menagerie, or small zoo, built at the royal palace of Versailles. Louis Le Vau (1612â€“70), first architect to King Louis XIV, designed the royal menagerie to consist of a central eight-sided tower: one side for the entrance, and seven sides looking out onto different animal enclosures.</p><p>From about 1790 onward, Bentham tirelessly campaigned to have a panopticon-style prison built in Britain. Such a building would serve as a proof of concept not only for the panopticon plan but also for Bentham&rsquo;s extensive ideas about prison reform. The panopticon design formed the centerpiece of his two-volume treatiseÂ <em>Panopticon; Or, The Inspection House</em>Â (1791), a work that also proposed several other innovations in prison management. Bentham was among the first to champion &ldquo;management by contract,&rdquo; or what is now called a private prison, on the grounds of efficiency. He argued that, if prison keepers were financially incentivized to keep their inmates healthy and in good order, they would do a better job than government-employed wardens. His predictions on this score are perhaps somewhat optimistic when juxtaposed with the reality of 21st-century private prisons, which have been widely criticized for improper treatment of detainees.</p><p>For a time, Bentham had the support of Prime Minister William Pitt, who authorized the building of a National Penitentiary on the panopticon plan. Despite Pitt&rsquo;s vote of approval, Bentham found himself wrangling over land-use rights and other legal obstacles for more than two decades before he finally despaired of completing the project. He continued, however, to write about the merits of the panopticon in such works asÂ <em>Panopticon versus New South Wales</em>Â (1812). Here he tried to market the panopticon as an economical and humane alternative to the system of penal transportation, whereby convicts were exiled to Australia to serve their sentences. Bentham did not live to see a panopticon built, but several modern prisons were constructed according to panopticon principles. Electronic surveillance has now essentially eliminated the need for a central tower.</p><p>A more basic concern for Foucault, however, is theÂ <em>panoptic</em>Â character of modern society. He sees the concept as going hand in hand with the rise and spread of disciplinary systems, creating a sense of potentially being watched at any time. Schools certainly function this way, as anyone who made a habit of passing notes in middle school has probably learned. So do many places of employment: random drug testing, though not specifically addressed by Foucault, is an excellent example of a panoptic phenomenon. Even organizations that exist specifically for the benefit of their clients, such as state and private social-welfare institutions, sometimes conduct panoptic surveillance: sending case workers on short notice to &ldquo;check up&rdquo; on clients, for example. Real, physical panopticons may be little more than architectural curiosities, but for Foucault they have come to represent pervasive panoptic systems and resulting behaviors.</p><hr><a href=#part-4-chapter-1--prison-complete-and-austere-institutions--summary><h1 id=part-4-chapter-1--prison-complete-and-austere-institutions--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 4, Chapter 1 : Prison (Complete and Austere Institutions) | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-9><h2 id=summary-9><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p>Having shown how disciplinary mechanisms developed and spread throughout society,Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Discipline-and-Punish-The-Birth-of-the-Prison/author/ rel=noopener>Foucault</a>Â returns to his discussion of prisons. The prison, he says, seems a &ldquo;natural&rdquo; punishment because it resembles the other disciplinary institutions, such as factories and hospitals, found in modern life. The early 19th-century laws that made imprisonment a standard punishment in France also established differentiated types of prisons based on the offenses committed. In this respect, they mirrored the fine hierarchies and subdivisions of other institutions, such as schools.</p><p>From the outset, prisons were subject to calls for reform. These calls came from all quartersâ€”from judges, philanthropists, and the prisoners themselves. Reform efforts, he suggests, were not a sporadic, irregular phenomenon but an essential characteristic of the prison system: &ldquo;the prison institution has always been a focus of concern and debate.&rdquo; Also characteristic of prisons is their status as &ldquo;complete &mldr; institutions&rdquo; in which a single authority controls all the usual disciplinary forces, such as education, medical treatment, and labor.</p><p>Foucault now lays out some of the other principles by which prisons operate, illustrating with examples from real 18th- and 19th-century institutions. Prisons, he says, isolate the offender to prevent potentially corrupting contact with the outside world and to forestall plots or collusion within the prison. Imprisonment also involves, at least traditionally, some kind of forced labor, viewed by the early reformers as an important means of transforming the prisoner&rsquo;s habits and attitudes. Finally, and most importantly, prisons allow for the &ldquo;modulation of the penalty&rdquo;: the escalation or relaxation of its severity and shortening or, in some cases, lengthening of the sentence.</p><p>The isolation and autonomy of prisons, coupled with their prominence in the modern justice system, have led to a conflict Foucault describes as the &ldquo;carceral&rdquo; versus the &ldquo;judicial.&rdquo; The &ldquo;carceral&rdquo; forces are those that operate and maintain the prison, seeking as much independence as possible from the &ldquo;judicial&rdquo; forces, which sentence people to imprisonment. The demand for prisons to reform inmates, Foucault says, has led to the rise of a &ldquo;carceral machinery&rdquo; that controls prison populations in a way at once medical, economic, and political. Prisoners are observed and the progress of their &ldquo;cure&rdquo; is monitored (medical). They are made or induced to work and offered small rewards (economic). They are prevented from associating with gangs that might threaten the prison&rsquo;s externally imposed hierarchy (political). The result of all this is that the offender becomes aÂ <em>delinquent</em>â€”a person defined not by a crime but by a body of knowledge collected by the prison authorities.</p><a href=#analysis-7><h2 id=analysis-7><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p>WhenÂ 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Discipline-and-Punish-The-Birth-of-the-Prison/author/ rel=noopener>Foucault</a>Â calls prisons &ldquo;complete institutions,&rdquo; he is referring to their total control over the inmates in all aspects of day-to-day life. Sociologists have studied this same type of setting, under the name ofÂ <em>total institution</em>. Indeed, it can be enlightening to compare the sociological concept of the total institution with the kinds of disciplinary institutions Foucault discusses throughoutÂ <em>Discipline</em>Â <em>and Punish</em>.Â <em>Sociology: Understanding and Changing the Social World</em>Â (2010), a university sociology textbook, lists &ldquo;military boot camps, convents, and monasteries&rdquo; as examples of total institutions. Not coincidentally, the Church and the military are the sources of modern disciplinary institutions Foucault identifies in Part 3.</p><p>Sociologists who study total institutions are naturally more concerned with the social forms and relationships that exist within such institutions. A sociologist might ask how a small-scale society, with its own norms of behavior and communication, forms within the walls of a psychiatric hospital or a monastery. For Foucault, a historian and philosopher, the interest lies in the societal forces that create such institutions and the techniques or tactics that sustain them. How do prisons work, and how did they come to occupy their current place within a larger society? These are major questions throughout the book and, arguably, the central questions of Parts 3 and 4.</p><p>Although they come from different academic backgrounds, Foucault&rsquo;s complete institution and the total institution of sociology have many similarities. The concept of the total institution is usually credited to Erving Goffman, who conducted extensive fieldwork at psychiatric hospitals and described his findings in the 1961 collectionÂ <em>Asylums</em>. One of his observations challenges, or at least complicates, the story told by Foucault. According to Goffman, total institutions aim to &ldquo;resocialize&rdquo; their inmates, patients, or recruits by depriving them of their identity. The sociology textbook offers the examples of shaved heads and uniforms found in boot camps, prisons, and mental asylums. However, Foucault proposes a nearly opposite reading: disciplinary institutions, including prisons, serve to sort and separate individuals, making them into &ldquo;cases&rdquo; to be observed and recorded.</p><p>Interestingly, sociology itself is among the &ldquo;disciplines&rdquo; Foucault sees as abetting the rise of the prison. Although he and Goffman are largely on the same page concerning the role of total (or &ldquo;complete and austere&rdquo;) institutions, Foucault is skeptical of sociology in general, and also of psychology. In his view these social sciences are both products of and contributors to the Enlightenment-era penal system and its modern descendants. The rise of the prison necessitated a theory of the criminal mind and of antisocial behaviors, thus giving rise to academic disciplines that could provide such explanations in a formal and authoritative way. Sociological and psychological theories, in turn, facilitated and helped to justify the process of dividing offenders into different, closely surveilled subpopulations.</p><hr><a href=#part-4-chapter-2--prison-illegalities-and-delinquency--summary><h1 id=part-4-chapter-2--prison-illegalities-and-delinquency--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 4, Chapter 2 : Prison (Illegalities and Delinquency) | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-10><h2 id=summary-10><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Discipline-and-Punish-The-Birth-of-the-Prison/author/ rel=noopener>Foucault</a>Â now delves into the definition of the delinquent and the role of delinquents in society. First, however, he describes an episode that, for him, epitomizes society&rsquo;s shift from public execution to incarceration. In 1837, he observes, the French government abolished the chain gang and replaced it with covered carts that isolated and restrained the prisoners. Before that time, convicts were chained together by iron collars on their necks and marched to their place of execution or imprisonment. But these marches became public spectacles in which the prisoners were sometimes subjected to assassination attempts and sometimes celebrated as heroes. These bizarre &ldquo;saturnalia&rdquo; (festivals) of punishment were an embarrassment to the ruling class and thus phased out.</p><p>Prisons, Foucault suggests, were soon criticized as &ldquo;the great failure of penal justice.&rdquo; Critics in the 19th century asserted that prisons did not prevent crime but turned one-time offenders into career criminals. They argued that the &ldquo;useless work&rdquo; assigned to convicts would diminish the inmates&rsquo; respect for the law rather than increase it. Thus, delinquents would be produced in large numbers, and prisons would provide ideal conditions for these delinquents to organize into gangs. Meanwhile, the difficulty of getting a job or finding a place to live upon release would force ex-convicts to return to their criminal ways. These criticisms, Foucault says, have not disappeared in the 20th century, nor have the rules governing prisons changed fundamentally. They are still the same principles described in Chapter 1.</p><p>Why, then, despite 150 years of criticism and supposed reform, is the carceral system still essentially unchanged? Because, Foucault says, it is functioning as intended, at least as far as society at large is concerned. The production of delinquents is not a &ldquo;failure,&rdquo; but part of the overall workings of the penal system. Delinquency, as Foucault defines it, is &ldquo;a politically or economically less dangerousâ€”and, on occasion, usableâ€”form of illegality&rdquo; and, as such, is preferable to more violent or socially disruptive forms of crime. Thus, the manufacturing of delinquents can be counted, somewhat cynically, as a victory for the prison system.</p><p>Another way of viewing the problem is that prisons do not make delinquents, per se, but identify them for later surveillance and &ldquo;use&rdquo;â€”a sort of catch-and-release system. Either way, although delinquents are a seemingly necessary product of the modern prison, their presence in society has been the subject of perennial public debate. Moreover, many political groups have included the elimination of delinquency as part of their platformâ€”especially when attempting to appeal to the middle class, whose property is endangered by delinquent behaviors.</p><p>To give a sense of the media debate surrounding delinquency, Foucault closes this chapter with several examples of reporting on delinquency from 19th-century French periodicals. Whereas the mainstream press of this era tended to depict delinquency as a product of laziness and vice, publications of the 19th-century workers&rsquo; movements challenged this narrative and described delinquency as a survival mechanism. As an instance of this counter narrative, Foucault mentions the memorable case of BÃ©asse, a teenager charged with vagabondage and brought before a judge. In the judge&rsquo;s narrow view, it is self-evident that the life of a vagabond entails an unacceptable lack of discipline and propriety. BÃ©asse, however, responds to the judge in a way that shows he sees vagabondage as liberty and mainstream disciplineâ€”a steady job, a stable home, and so forthâ€”as a form of slavery.</p><a href=#analysis-8><h2 id=analysis-8><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p>ForÂ 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Discipline-and-Punish-The-Birth-of-the-Prison/author/ rel=noopener>Foucault</a>Â the chain gang is one of the last vestiges of the old order of public spectacle. To underscore its &ldquo;spectacular&rdquo; nature, he chooses the Latin termÂ <em>saturnalia</em>Â for the meetings between chain gangs and townsfolk. This is the name of a specific Roman festival during which all shops were closed, slaves were freed for a day, and a &ldquo;king&rdquo; (<em>princeps</em>) was selected to preside over the celebration. Like the Feast of Fools in the Middle Ages or Mardi Gras in the modern era, Saturnalia was a day on which ordinary rules were suspended or even reversed: a sort of release valve for a society bound up in laws and hierarchies. Inasmuch as the chain gang brought about a &ldquo;saturnalia&rdquo;-like atmosphere, it was taking French society back toward the grim &ldquo;festivals&rdquo; of the scaffold, at which the mob threatened to overrule the authorities.</p><p>In Foucault&rsquo;s view, the police carriage, which replaced the chain gang in 1837, was &ldquo;a mobile equivalent of the Panopticon.&rdquo; He chooses it as an example because it replicates many of the aspects he has identified as central to the modern prison system. For one thing, it keeps the prisoners under constant surveillanceâ€”hence the panopticon image. It also provides for means of increasing or lightening the punishmentâ€”for example, by tightening the chains or providing a cushion for sleeping. Perhaps the most prison-like characteristic of the carriage, however, is its function of &ldquo;reforming&rdquo; the prisoners by subjecting them to constant discomfort.</p><p>When Foucault uses the wordÂ <em>reform</em>Â to describe the transformation brought about by the carriage, he is being at least somewhat sarcastic, because what the carriage ride really brought about was an exhausted, demoralized, unresisting state. In another sense, though, the police carriage was much more of an &ldquo;apparatus of reform&rdquo; than the chain gang had been. Despite the painful and burdensome nature of their restraints, the convicts on the chain gang were free to celebrate their assumed identities as criminals. They could terrify or amuse the populace with tales of their exploits and revel in the admiration, or the scorn, of onlookers. In stepping onto a police carriage, however, a prisoner left the world behindâ€”becoming, in Foucault&rsquo;s terms, not a criminal but a delinquent to be reformed.</p><hr><a href=#part-4-chapter-3--prison-the-carceral--summary><h1 id=part-4-chapter-3--prison-the-carceral--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Â Part 4, Chapter 3 : Prison (The Carceral) | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-11><h2 id=summary-11><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Discipline-and-Punish-The-Birth-of-the-Prison/author/ rel=noopener>Foucault</a>Â sums up the trajectory and the effects of society&rsquo;s transition to a &ldquo;carceral&rdquo; (prison-centric) system of penal justice. To illustrate his points, he describes life at Mettray, a French penal colony designed for male juvenile delinquents. The strict and comprehensive discipline at Mettray was, Foucault says, characteristic of the carceral system in its fullest form. The boys there underwent a controlled regimen of education, work, physical training, and religious instruction. The colony&rsquo;s supervisors, meanwhile, attended a special academy to school them in the art of imposing discipline. For Foucault this &ldquo;normalization of the power of normalization&rdquo; indicated &ldquo;a new era&rdquo; in penal history.</p><p>Mettray is also noteworthy as an example of what Foucault calls the &ldquo;carceral archipelago,&rdquo; the network of prison-like institutions that, though not quite prisons, extended the reach and scope of the carceral project. Such institutions included not only juvenile detention facilities like Mettray but also workhouses, convent schools, and orphanages. With the growth of this &ldquo;archipelago,&rdquo; the carceral ideal of total discipline diffused further into society. Delinquents, as described in the previous chapter, could have entire &ldquo;careers&rdquo; passing from one carceral system to another, starting with the orphanage and ending with the almshouse.</p><p>The spread of the carceral system, in turn, made &ldquo;the power to punish natural and legitimate&rdquo;: something no longer relegated to the courts but present in all society&rsquo;s institutions. Punishments large and small seem less arbitrary when they form part of a finely graded continuum capable of responding to each offense. Moreover, in a society in which punishing is a natural function of authority, judging is natural too: doctors, teachers, and social workers are empowered to judge their subjects in different ways. Ultimately, Foucault concludes, the prison has become a sort of hub around which many of society&rsquo;s institutions revolve, each in some way extending the reach of the carceral system.</p><a href=#analysis-9><h2 id=analysis-9><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Discipline-and-Punish-The-Birth-of-the-Prison/author/ rel=noopener>Foucault</a>Â concludesÂ <em>Discipline and Punishment</em>Â by coming full circle. In Part 3 he charted the rise of what he called the &ldquo;disciplinary society,&rdquo; in which mechanisms of surveillance and judgment became ever more widespread. His argument there, made explicit at the beginning of Part 4, is that the proliferation of disciplinary mechanisms prepared society for the transition to prisons as a primary means of punishing offenders. He now argues that prisons, in turn, have exerted their own effect on the rest of society. Just as the disciplines of the hospital, school, and workhouse came together to create the modern prison, the total discipline of the prison now radiates outward into various social institutions. Taking its cue from society at large, prison has become more disciplined, and society, taking its cue from prisons, has become more &ldquo;carceral.&rdquo; Perhaps because his focus is on the French penal system specifically, Foucault does not explicitly mention the extremes to which the carceral system was developed under other 20th-century modern regimes. His contemporary readers, living just one generation removed from World War II (1939â€“45), would likely have recognized the concentration camps of Nazi Germany as examples of a &ldquo;carceral archipelago&rdquo; taken to its chilling conclusion. The gulags (forced-labor camps for political prisoners) of the Soviet Union provide another illustration of carcerality run amok.</p><p>Indeed, throughout the book, Foucault has been careful to avoid judgments about how humane or inhumane a particular penal system is. This restraint does not mean he regards imprisonment as equal in cruelty to burning at the stake. Nor does it mean he thinks modern prisons are morally equivalent to 17th-century dungeons. Rather, one aim ofÂ <em>Discipline and Punish</em>Â is to counter the commonplace narrative that penal reform stemmed mainly from moral concerns. Whether or not prisons are more humane than the old penal system (a problem Foucault leaves to the reader), their humaneness is not theÂ <em>reason</em>Â they replaced the scaffold and the stocks. Instead, Foucault has argued, a variety of economic and political forces brought about this shift. The humanity or inhumanity of imprisonment is a byproduct of those forces.</p><p>It would be a mistake, however, to assume that Foucault&rsquo;s neutral tone and emphasis on facts mean he is comfortable with the modern prison system. Rather, he sees this system as &ldquo;insidious,&rdquo; &ldquo;cruel,&rdquo; and &ldquo;cunning&rdquo; in both its design and execution. His condemnation of the carceral state is subtle, unfolding a word at a time, but it is there all the same. Indeed, the closing words of the bookâ€”the &ldquo;distant roar of battle&rdquo; to which Foucault alludesâ€”suggest that the discontents surrounding the carceral system are sure to erupt into an open conflict once again.</p><hr><a href=#quotes><h1 id=quotes><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Quotes</h1></a><ol><li></li></ol><blockquote><p>Â We have, then, a public execution and a time-table.Â </p></blockquote><p>Narrator,Â

Discipline, as epitomized by the military drill or the handwriting exercise, constitutes one such system. It functions by asserting ever more detailed control over individuals&rsquo; movements and gestures. This practice gradually makes them &ldquo;docile&rdquo;â€”able to be controlled without resistance.</p><ol start=10><li></li></ol><blockquote><p>Â Discipline &lsquo;makes&rsquo; individuals; it is the specific technique of a power that regards individuals as objects.Â </p></blockquote><p>Narrator,Â

In the old days, he says, the masses were regarded as an undifferentiated rabble. Only the most notorious, or most powerful, people were treated as individuals and had their deeds noticed and recorded by society at large. Modern disciplinary institutions reverse this situation, pulling individuals out of the multitude and making privacy and anonymity into privileges.</p><ol start=11><li></li></ol><blockquote><p>Â Visibility is a trap.Â </p></blockquote><p>Narrator,Â

In premodern times, visibility was the prerogative of wealthy elites: to &ldquo;see and be seen&rdquo; was a means of displaying one&rsquo;s political power. With the rise of discipline, however, visibility came to be seen as a liability rather than an asset. Prisoners are visible to the warden but not vice versa. Experimental subjects are visible to the experimenter but not vice versa.</p><ol start=12><li></li></ol><blockquote><p>Â Is it surprising that prisons resemble factories, schools, barracks, hospitals, which all resemble prisons?Â </p></blockquote><p>Narrator,Â

Part 3 charts the spread of disciplinary mechanismsâ€”such as timekeeping, drills, and examinationsâ€”throughout the worlds of work, education, medicine, and warfare. Thus, the answer to Foucault&rsquo;s question here is a resoundingÂ <em>no</em>. Prisons, he argues, took shape against a more general backdrop of discipline in which &ldquo;factories, schools, barracks, and hospitals&rdquo; all participated.</p><ol start=13><li></li></ol><blockquote><p>Â It would not be true to say that the prison was born with the new codes.Â </p></blockquote><p>Narrator,Â

He now sums up his answer by describing the gradual emergence of the prison, the &ldquo;birth&rdquo; alluded to in the book&rsquo;s subtitle. Although one can point to specific dates on which laws regarding prisons were passed, Foucault says, none of these is the birthdate of imprisonment as a modern penal practice. Instead, prison as it is known in modern times, gradually emerged from a variety of disciplinary practices already used elsewhere in society.</p><ol start=14><li></li></ol><blockquote><p>Â Delinquency [is] a politically or economically less dangerousâ€”and &mldr; usableâ€”form of illegality.Â </p></blockquote><p>Narrator,Â

Foucault counters these claims by answering that prisons are, in fact, fulfilling a valuable social function, though one not usually discussed aloud. Prisons take in criminals and turn them into delinquents, or &ldquo;less dangerous&rdquo; offenders whose movements can be tracked and whose activities can be monitored. In doing so, prisons recast some of the &ldquo;illegalities&rdquo; of society into a form potentially useful to the dominant classes.</p><ol start=15><li></li></ol><blockquote><p>Â We are far from the country of tortures &mldr; we are far, too, from [the] dream of the reformers.Â </p></blockquote><p>Narrator,Â 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Discipline-and-Punish-The-Birth-of-the-Prison/part-4-chapter-3-summary/ rel=noopener>Part 4, Chapter 3</a></p><p>For Foucault, the rise of the prison system went hand-in-hand with a broader transformation of society. The old &ldquo;country of tortures&rdquo; was a society hierarchically dominated by a sovereign. The modern &ldquo;carceral city&rdquo; is more like a network with no clear apex or center. Instead of punishment coming from above, discipline pervades society through a host of institutions, of which the prison is only the most obvious.</p><hr><a href=#glossary><h1 id=glossary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Glossary</h1></a><p><strong>amende honorable</strong>:Â <em>(n)</em>Â a public confession of and apology for one&rsquo;s crimes.

He studied psychology and philosophy at the Ã‰cole Normale SupÃ©rieure in Parisâ€”one of France&rsquo;s most prestigious private universitiesâ€”between 1946 and his graduation in 1952. He received his doctorate in 1961 with the dissertationÂ <em>Madness and Unreason: A History of Madness in the Classical Age.</em></p><a href=#publications><h3 id=publications><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Publications</h3></a><p>Foucault first came to wide attention in 1966 after publishingÂ <em>The Order of Things</em>. In this work he attempted an &ldquo;archaeology&rdquo; of human sciences, including linguistics, biology, and economics. This &ldquo;archaeology&rdquo; was based on a belief that each era of history is defined by an underlying set of assumptions about the world and what is known or believed about reality. He followed this with a further publication developing his archaeological project,Â <em>The Archaeology of Knowledge</em>Â (1969). In 1970 he was awarded an academic position (the chair in the history of thought-systems) at the prestigious CollÃ¨ge de France. This position allowed him to concentrate more fully on researching and publishing, leading directly to his most productive period.</p><p>In the 1970s Foucault&rsquo;s project shifted from intellectual &ldquo;archaeology&rdquo; to &ldquo;genealogy.&rdquo; With genealogy, he began tracing the history of how dominant paradigms, or typical examples or models, in patterns of thought develop through trial, error, historical accident, and other pathways.Â <em>Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison</em>Â (1975) examined social and technical changes in the conception of crime and punishment in the West. In particular, he identified a shift from the public and bloody torture of the body to institutions and ideas, like the prison, that turned people into disciplined subjects. He devoted much of his remaining years working on a proposed five-volumeÂ <em>History of Sexuality</em>. Only the first three volumes,Â <em>The Will to Knowledge</em>Â (1976),Â <em>The Use of Pleasure</em>Â (1984), andÂ <em>The Care of the Self</em>Â (1984) were completed at the time of his death in 1984.</p><p>Foucault&rsquo;s central project was an inquiry into the development of intellectual and social paradigms in the modern world. He argued that power was, fundamentally, a social relationship. It worked through interactions between individuals rather than as a structure imposed from above. Furthermore, he believed this meant power was not fixed but changeable. Indeed, it was changing all the time through social struggle. Foucault was himself an active participant in struggles for political and social liberty. He had been a member of the French Communist Party in the 1950s but left after only three years owing to the party&rsquo;s bigotry against homosexuals and Jews. Although he resisted orthodoxies, he remained a left-wing activist and public figure throughout his life, championing prison reform in France and campaigning against racism and human rights abuses worldwide.</p><a href=#death-and-legacy><h3 id=death-and-legacy><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Death and Legacy</h3></a><p>Michel Foucault died on June 25, 1984, at the age of 57. Foucault had contracted HIV, which developed into AIDS, during the epidemic of the 1980s. At the time, the disease was not well understood. The first truly effective therapies would appear only in the 1990s. Foucault&rsquo;s partner, sociologist Daniel Defert, founded the first French AIDS advocacy charity, AIDESâ€”named after the French world for helpâ€”in Foucault&rsquo;s memory.</p><p>The impact of Foucault&rsquo;s work, particularly its focus on the history and social construction of power, has</p><p>endured. It has been influential in the field of critical theory: the study of the social, ideological, and historical factors that produce culture. It has also greatly influenced postcolonial theory, which studies the creation, endurance, and overthrow of colonial regimes and their cultural and social legacies.Â <em>Discipline and Punish</em>, though primarily concerned with French history, is illustrative of this broader relevance. The disciplines of power it describes may have originated in the West, but they soon extended to colonial and postcolonial societies worldwide.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://potatomat0.github.io/obsidian-public-vault/js/graph.6579af7b10c818dbd2ca038702db0224.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Nhat Hoang Â© 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://potatomat0.github.io/obsidian-public-vault/>Home</a></li><li><a href=http://nhatkothieunang.web.app/>Other hobby links</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/potatomat0/obsidian-public-vault>GitHub</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
