Marielle Burkhalter, along with Stavroula Bellos, would eventually become the director of the 
<a href="http://www2.univ-paris8.fr/deleuze/article.php3?id_article=2" rel=noopener><em>L’association Siècle Deleuzien</em></a>, and oversaw the French transcriptions of Deleuze’s seminars at the 
<a href=http://www2.univ-paris8.fr/deleuze/ rel=noopener><em>Voix de Gilles Deleuze</em></a> website at the University of Paris 8.</p><p>Links to a number of these recordings that are available on YouTube are provided below, each of which includes subtitles in Italian. We are grateful to those who have uploaded these videos.</p><p>We have ordered the video material chronologically and divided it into 3 categories, providing short titles describing the topics covered for general orientation.</p><p>The first category (A) refers to the aforementioned seminars that were filmed at Paris-8 Vincennes in 1975-76, while Deleuze and Guattari were working on specific “plateaus” within what would become “Mille Plateaux”. We have clues for approximate dates and one specific indication to help situate these. First, in the session (or sessions) under the Molar and Molecular Multiplicities recording, Deleuze addresses material in <em>A Thousand Plateaus</em> that precedes topics discussed in the subsequent Il Senso in Meno recordings. Then, an Iranian student speaking in session 7 states this session’s date as February 3, 1976. Thus, for the sessions 2 through 6, we have provided approximate dates for successive Tuesdays that follow session 1 and precede February 3, while two sessions, 4 & 5, that occur on the same day, receive the same date. For the sessions following session 7, we have provided approximate dates corresponding to subsequent Tuesdays while 1) making adjustments for a missing session that preceded session 8; and 2) including under March 2 both session 9 (all three segments included in the recording) and session 10.</p><p>The second category (B) includes seminars from 1980-87, after the campus of Vincennes had been demolished and relocated to St. Denis. The third category (C) features fragments and short clips from the Il Senso in Meno recordings, which we have ordered sequentially and have also provided time stamps to the transcriptions.</p><p>Deleuze in his seminar at the University of Paris VIII, Vincennes, in 1975.</p><p><em><em>This session corresponds to the YouTube recording, Deleuze su molteplicità molare et molteplicità molecolare</em>_,_ containing segments from three successive Tuesday sessions. The Part I opening is remarkable for providing visual evidence of the extraordinarily cramped space in which Deleuze worked at Vincennes, where he acknowledges Guattari’s presence who does not intervene in the recording. After reviewing previous topics discussed, Deleuze introduces variables of molecular multiplicities that Deleuze lists: bridges; a network; the borderline (<em>bordure</em>); threshold or door; fiber; and the plane of consistency or rhizosphere. Deleuze steps back to consider multiplicities of a primarily molar nature and their characteristics, and he points out that within the molar schema, all kinds of other phenomena intervene and perturb the molar multiplicities. These constitute forms of mixing that Deleuze outlines, and in contrast to the centralized molar multiplicity, Deleuze develops a network of linkages each time with a black hole that is both receiver and emitter of each element, of each black hole. Deleuze then focuses on the molecular multiplicities defined through their dimensions, specifically their maximal dimension that is the borderline, with reference to work by René Thom and examples from Melville, Virginia Woolfe, Henry Miller, and Lovecraft. As the recording shifts, Deleuze develops the importance of gangs in terms of the molar aggregate organization, with a centralized leader, but also points to molecular aspects of the gang organize that shift back into the molar aggregate, on one hand, the phenomena of the borderline or flight, on the other, a shift back to a centralized leadership and organizing function. A third, very brief fragment commences in mid-quotation from Lovecraft (located in <em>A Thousand Plateaus</em>, p. 251) with Deleuze discussing the possibility of numerous dimensions possessed by molecular multiplicities, with reference to Woolfe’s <em>The Waves</em> and Kafka “Josephine the Singer”. These examples allow Deleuze to connect, in the fragment’s final minutes, with the simultaneity of two asymmetrical becomings that he calls a block of becoming.</em></p><p><strong>Gilles Deleuze</strong></p><p><strong>Deleuze & Guattari at Vincennes, 1975-76</strong> </p><p><em><strong>Deleuze su molteplicità molare et molteplicità molecolare</strong></em><strong>, Parts I, II, III: Molar and Molecular Multiplicities</strong></p><p><strong>Translated by Graeme Thomson and Silvia Maglioni</strong></p><p>[<em>This recording contains segments from three successive Tuesday sessions given the evident shifts, from one part to the next, of camera locations, blackboard drawings, students near Deleuze, and classroom configurations. Moreover, Part I begins with Deleuze’s review of specific points covered in several preceding sessions for which we have no recordings, followed by shorter, successive segments. Hence, we situate the approximate session dates as I, starting on November 18, 1975, II continuing on November 25, and ending with a brief segment III, on December 2.</em>]</p><p>[<em>Deleuze, with Guattari in attendance, reviews the concepts of molar and molecular aggregates and multiplicities, thereby developing their ongoing collaboration which will result, in 1980, in A Thousand Plateaus.</em>]</p><p>[<em>Please note that the transcription follows as exactly as possible the discussion in the filmed seminar, and therefore the translation differs at time with the discussion rendered in the subtitles on the YouTube versions</em>]</p><p>[<em>Deleuze entering the room very slowly, due crowd blocking his path</em>]</p><p>Deleuze: How are we going to manage?</p><p>A woman student: We can just stay here like this.</p><p>Another woman student: It’s not complicated… you just have to lift your leg…</p><p>Deleuze: I can’t. It’s stuck… [<em>Pause</em>] It’s not just to be able to move, it’s so we can breathe… [<em>Pause</em>] It’s a life question! [<em>Pause</em>]</p><p>A woman student: Can you put out that cigarette?</p><p>Deleuze: Aaaah! [<em>He lifts his legs and continues trying to enter</em>] [<em>Pause</em>] Hello, Félix. [<em>Pause; Deleuze observes the crowd, looks at the blackboard for chalk, slowly takes off his coat, then places his books on the table</em>] I’d like to raise a problem, an interesting one. Over there, [<em>He points to the left, his right</em>] there’s glass fiber there. Imagine if a fire broke out. <em>[Pause</em>_]_ You see the door? [<em>He points over to his far left</em>] We would all die. All of us. [<em>Nervous laughter</em>]</p><p>A woman student: Unless we jump from the window. [<em>Pause</em>]</p><p>Deleuze: Except me, perhaps… [<em>Laughter</em>] But all of you will perish. Which is to say you shouldn’t come to class; I have to be quite honest! The working conditions here don’t conform to safety norms. So when the fire starts, don’t panic. We don’t move, we don’t worry…</p><p>Guattari: Have you seen Narboni who was waiting for you…</p><p>Deleuze: Sorry?</p><p>Guattari: Tu as vu Narboni ?</p><p>Deleuze: Yes, I’ve seen Narboni. [<em>Pause; Deleuze speaks to students behind him quite softly perhaps to ask that they not smoke</em>] … That will make me choke. <em>[Pause</em>_] That’s better. [Pause__]_ Does anyone have a piece of chalk? <em>[Pause</em>_]_ Some chalk? <em>[Pause</em>_] Some_ chalk? <em>[Pause</em>_]_ Thank you… Ok, so, as usual I will summarize the topics we have already covered because… what is it?</p><p>A student: I can’t hear very well.</p><p>Deleuze: It will come. My voice is always a bit low to begin with. It will come. So, the topics… I think we began with… I’ll always recapitulate like this, so that when we go back to a given topic, those who were present…</p><p>A woman student: Louder!</p><p>Deleuze: Oh no, shit, really? — … those who were present will be able to recall it. So, there’s a first topic that we will put aside for the moment, concerning a certain number of figures of <em>segmentarity</em>. And then there’s a second topic, which concerns at the same time <em>molar aggregates</em> and <em>molecular lines</em>. And, of course, these molar aggregates and molecular lines become mixed. We also briefly mentioned two complementarities, two relations of complementarity between the molar aggregates and the molecular lines that mix with them.</p><p>First of all, there is a direct complementarity: the bigger the molar aggregates become, the more the molecular lines become enmeshed with them, trace movements of flight etc. And there is also a second complementarity that is… Did I start with the direct one? I don’t remember…</p><p>A student: Yes.</p><p>Deleuze: There is an inverse complementarity. Last time, we also sketched out a third topic which was a rapid analysis, or rather a rapid effect of the analysis, of the verb “to be” as a principle of the molar aggregates and their elements. And, on the other hand, we made an analysis of the conjunction “and” as a broken-line type of movement, a movement of the molecular line. And we imagined a kind of… tension – which is not contradiction – but a kind of tension between the <em>“est”</em> (is) of the verb “to be” and the <em>“et”</em> (and) of the conjunction, and we said that this tension would, for different reasons, traverse language as a whole, or at least certain languages.</p><p>And some of you raised the objection that apparently, in some languages this tension between <em>“est”</em> and <em>“et”</em> doesn’t exist. Not only does it not exist but also the very structure of these languages denies it. This really unsettled us and yet, at the same time, we noted that a certain play of the conjunction “and” defines minor languages, or the minor use of certain languages, in opposition to the imperialism and hegemony of the verb “to be” in so-called major languages. And we also realized that we would have to return to this objection for the themes for which we had no answer at the time, thinking we would devote a lesson to it, and those who had made objections, namely that this wouldn’t work, at least in the cases of Arabic or Chinese.</p><p>But we were reassured by the fact that it did work for languages I proposed to call neither minor nor major – languages eroded from within by strong minorities, such as British and American English. British and American English as a whole are traversed by a very peculiar use of the conjunction “and”. There we are. You may have found all this a bit dispersive, but I think you’ve understood that… [<em>Deleuze does not complete the sentence</em>]</p><p>Today, I’d like to start on a fourth topic and this fourth topic would consist more or less in saying that we will try to establish a certain status typical of what we could call “molecular multiplicities”. You see, this could be considered a different topic but at the same time it’s the same as the previous ones because it implies a certain rapport between multiplicities that we call “molar” and multiplicities that we call “molecular”. And, together with Guattari, I have sought… I don’t want to go back to things we’ve already covered but I would like to tell you how we have managed to advance on this somewhat. We looked for a certain number of variables that could be considered variables of a particular type of multiplicity, which we will call “molecular”. I pronounce these first of all for the pleasure the words give me, but also so that all of you can bear them in mind and to situate them in aggregates, in masses, in multiplicities.</p><p>The variables we wish to propose today are those that correspond to the category of <em>bridges</em>. A bridge. A bridge might not seem very molecular but it doesn’t matter. A bridge… Second variable: <em>ring</em>, or <em>network</em>. Third variable: <em>borderline</em>. Fourth variable: <em>threshold</em> and <em>door</em>. Fifth variable: <em>fiber</em>. Sixth variable, which is obviously the most beautiful: <em>rhizosphere</em>, or <em>plane of consistency</em>. Good. I’ll say that for the moment I would roughly like to place them, while avoiding anything to do with axioms or structures. I want to place these variables within a certain type of multiplicity.</p><p>Obviously…  obviously these multiplicities or these masses don’t exist on their own. I think again of the objection we began with yesterday, that all this is anyhow a form of dualism. Molecular multiplicities, when they are present, spread or stretch out, they spread together with multiplicities of large aggregates, multiplicities we shall call “molar”. They are inside, they slip underneath, spread out on the surface, they always exist one within the other, according to what we previously defined as a double complementarity.</p><p>So, we have to begin again from the schema we proposed at a certain point that concerned – and here I’ll be brief – multiplicities of a primarily molar nature. How do we recognize a molar multiplicity? Molar multiplicities include both aggregates – large aggregates – and the elements of these large aggregates. You remember how we were convinced that the distinction molar/molecular doesn’t correspond to that between aggregate and element? So, molar multiplicities are a certain type of aggregate comprised of certain elements.</p><p>How do we define them? We proposed to define them through the schema of arborescence. Each time you have an arborescent schema you have the formal pattern of a multiplicity that we can call a <em>molar multiplicity</em>. The simplest arborescent schema – because arborescent schemas are extremely complicated – the simplest arborescent schema is that which proceeds — I’m not brave enough to go to the blackboard, so please follow my finger — is that which proceeds by a succession of dichotomies. But there are others that are more complicated. If I try to express the arborescent schema in its most general form… — perfect, perfect [<em>Deleuze reacts to someone on his right who has brought in a tree branch, soon to be visible on camera; Deleuze stands and goes to the board</em>] But the one you’ve got is simple — <em>[Pause</em>_]_ More or less it, would be this. [<em>Pause</em>] I can’t continue because… well, we don’t need this. [<em>Pause</em>] So, there we have an arborescent schema in its most general form.</p><p>If I try now quickly to list its characteristics, even if this means connecting them with things we looked at last year, I would say that in this aggregate, in this type of multiplicity – the molar multiplicity – their first characteristic is that <em>binary machines exist in their own right</em>. Every time, you have a dichotomizing operation that exists in its own right. Once again, either you’re a man or a woman, a bourgeois or a proletarian and so on. It’s all a play of binary machines that exist in their own right.</p><p>Second characteristic: there is… these multiplicities that we call molar are <em>centered multiplicities</em>. Here, the center is shown by the small circle. In other words, if I try to connect it to the things that we looked at last year, there is a central black hole. And this central black hole is not the only one. On the contrary… All the other black holes spread around the multiplicity, resonate together with the central black hole, which in this way is able to move in all directions. Last year, we would have said: All the eyes resonate in a kind of central computer-eye, a single eye, a third eye, which organizes the multiplicity as a whole.</p><p>Third characteristic: I will say that these multiplicities are <em>evolutive multiplicities</em>, even if they don’t actually evolve. But if they don’t evolve, what happens to them? If they don’t evolve, they end up regressing. Yet both regression and progression are characteristics – directions – of evolution itself. By evolutive multiplicities I mean that they undergo a progression or a regression. In other words, what determines these multiplicities are lines of filiation or lines of lineage.</p><p>It’s not by chance that the doctrine that was called Evolutionism began – and I stress that this was just a beginning because it wasn’t limited to this – it began by posing questions in terms of filiation and lineage. In this regard, Darwin’s key text speaks of how the novelty of Evolutionism consists in raising the questions of filiation and lineage that had never been posed by previous natural historians. However, this doesn’t mean they ignored other phenomena. So what are these phenomena? We shall see, we shall see… These other phenomena, which we’ll look at later, are treated as categories that have to be subordinated to phenomena of filiation and lineage.</p><p>Other characteristic, and now I’d like to read you a text. “In an arborescent system, only a single neighbor is admitted: the hierarchical superior.” [<em>The text is by Pierre Rosenstiehl and Jean Petitot, “Automate asocial et systèmes acentrés”,</em> Communications <em>22 (1974); see</em> A Thousand Plateaus_, pp. 16-17_] It’s all in the schema. You start from a branch, this point that I call “small a” admits only one neighbor, the one from which it receives information, and which in the arborescent series of ramifications is its hierarchical superior. Or, if you prefer, from the perspective of filiation, its ancestor. The genetic ancestor, for example.</p><p>The text goes on: “In an arborescent system, the channels of transmission are pre-established. Arborescence pre-exists the individual, who is integrated into it at a precise point.” In computer science, this is called “a regime of centered automata”. It goes without saying that if I try – from the point of view of evolutive multiplicities – to define what is progression in opposition to regression, I would say that progression is the passage from the least differentiated (like you have there for example) to the most differentiated. In fact, when biologists of Darwin’s epoch were asked what was the single criterion for organic progression, they would say it’s an organism that becomes increasingly differentiated.</p><p>The last feature I wish to insist upon is that in these molar multiplicities… — I’m not fully committed here; we could really… these are questions that I’d like almost immediately to pose to you; we could trace a genesis, a passage from one characteristic to the other; it would be easy to consider how they end up, but it’s not worth it; let’s just consider them as characteristics — So the last characteristic I will consider for the moment is that, in this type of multiplicity, there must be a principle of what we will call <em>organization</em> or <em>structuration</em>, which conducts the increasingly advanced game of differentiation or which distributes the binarities, the dichotomies, or which makes the black holes circulate throughout the entire system. But what is interesting is that this organizing or structuring principle is always hidden. It lets us see but is itself unseen.</p><p>So, for molar multiplicities what is invoked is an intelligibility that is deeper than sensibility. Or we have an interior – for example an interior of life – deeper than the manifestations of life. For example, as far as we know… I would almost say that if we can recognize in a multiplicity one of the aforementioned characteristics… I hope that in today’s seminar it will all become clearer and more concrete. But if we found one of the aforementioned features at a concrete level in a multiplicity, I think we could say: however small it may be, however minuscule the elements at play, what we have is a molar multiplicity.</p><p>I’ll give you an example: so-called Western music, and by this I’m not referring just to contemporary music but to classical music. In a way, we’ve always been told that there was a principle that we can also call… that for a musical work considered as a sonic multiplicity, there was a principle that could be called, no matter, a structuring principle or an organizational principle, and it was this principle that gave us to hear or listen. It was this principle that let us hear what we heard. But in and for itself, it went unheard. And if we consider what certain composers – even contemporary composers like Stockhausen or Boulez – refer to today as <em>structure</em>, it’s clear that a musical structure <em>makes us hear</em>. But the structure itself goes unheard. And perhaps, if we take this term in a wider sense, it can be understood only through what it lets us hear.</p><p>Now, here’s the question I wanted to ask without any need of an immediate answer: I wonder if, for example, what we could broadly call the Western conception of the unconscious doesn’t depend precisely on this type of molar multiplicity. We shall see… For the moment, all this is still quite abstract, but I would like to speak about things of a more concrete nature. We don’t even need to mention now that there exist multiplicities of another type — <em>molecular multiplicities</em> — but let’s just say that in this schema of molar multiplicities you have all kinds of other phenomena slipping in, making irruptions, mixing with, penetrating molar multiplicities and constituting within them – in a completely immanent manner – another type of multiplicity that will perturb them from within. This is an important thing to bear in mind for the future because, if there are such workings from within, if molar multiplicities are affected by multiplicities of a different nature, you’ll see that we will be able to find a better order for the topics we covered in the last few lessons.</p><p>I would like to demonstrate this by mixing almost everything together, which is to say by invoking a little bit of science and a bit of… not exactly dream, but I don’t know, let’s say literature. But I won’t mix them, because otherwise none of you will give it credence. I would like to identify some poles – a certain number of poles – pertaining to what certain experts are researching. And this is important for us because in every field today… Guattari and I, when we find a specific example that we can’t fully understand, because the scholars can be extremely difficult… the only thing we immediately understand is that each time they say: “What we apply are above all arborescent schema”, which incidentally are much more elaborate than my little schema. You would need specialized mathematicians to make sense of them. But for example, in mathematical statistics – which is an extremely difficult, highly complex field – they have a method called (and it’s not by chance they’ve given it this name, since scholars don’t use metaphors) <em>counting trees.</em> Today mathematical statistics uses it all the time, but counting-trees methods don’t account for the kind of phenomena I’m interested in.</p><p>We have to find a completely different model – I don’t care what term we use – a completely different model or schema or type. And everywhere you look — in biology, mathematics, physics, chemistry, linguistics, everywhere — in every field, arborescent schema that for a long time have been dominant, and which according to me are still completely tied to the axiomatic period of science, are in the process of being overturned. Because science has ceased to be, or has ceased to take up, any kind of axiomatic or structural ideal.</p><p>But let’s try to be more concrete. First of all, we have to confront the existence of what we can only call <em>bridges.</em> Bridges… and so what would a bridge be? Actually, we don’t really need to depart from my schema on the blackboard. It’s enough to simply add it in. And the question I want to pose now is: will this schema be able to answer or account for what I wish to add here? And what I wish to add is… this and this. Twice. Two bridges.</p><p>So how should we define these bridges? As <em>whatever</em> <em>connection between two heterogeneous lines or lineages</em>. These are things that all of us know, and that we’ve already looked at, so I’m going to speed things up a bit. Let’s go back to some examples that Guattari and I have already developed at length. There’s an odd story we keep going back to, which is quite fascinating: wasp-orchid. [<em>See</em> A Thousand Plateaus, <em>pp. 10-13, 293-294</em>] In simple terms, the orchid reproduces a sort of image of the wasp in such a way that it can wed itself to the wasp’s image. A kind of transversal bond is created between two realms, between an element of the vegetable kingdom and one of the animal kingdom. This is what I would call a <em>bridge</em>.</p><p>You see what we’re attempting to derive. You can never derive a bridge from a filiation. If I was to seek a common filiation, my whole schema would collapse because I placed the bridge between two series, two differentiated lines. But here at the top of the board we have a common filiation, and the bridge makes it collapse. We would have to find a common filiation, a common ancestor of the wasp and the orchid. We can actually go as far as saying that a bridge is always <em>between realms</em> [<em>inter-règne</em>].</p><p>So already here, we have no choice if we accept all this, that there are bridges. Bridges don’t only exist in biology. Physicists and chemists too speak of having to introduce bridges into piles. In current theories regarding polymers, for example, there is a need to introduce bridges – while classical schemes don’t acknowledge this.</p><p>I would say that the bridge is always a term of alliance, an alliance between two realms, so the living world is no longer understood – I’m exaggerating – so the different parts of the living world are no longer understood in terms of filiations and lineages but of alliances, which suits us perfectly. Because if we try to define Neo-evolutionism, which is to say Post-Darwinian evolutionary theory, we would say that it’s a theory that has increasingly been forced to renounce the primacy, the hegemony of the theme of filiations.</p><p>So can we say there is a wasp-orchid alliance? We know there exist phenomena of vital alliances in the aggregates of so-called symbioses or parasitisms, but more generally in the domain of symbiosis. It would be interesting if evolution occurred through alliance rather than filiation, at which point perhaps it would no longer be evolution. So what would it be? Another kind of multiplicity: <em>molecular multiplicities</em>, micro-multiplicities.</p><p>Bridges define and bring into play a whole system of micro-multiplicities. But in what sense? For example, in contemporary genetic research we are told that beyond any filiation there may be communication between two lines, two completely independent series, through a virus. A virus that connects both to the genetic inheritance of a given species and to that of another species that has nothing in common with the first – so the virus functions as a bridge between two species with no common filiation and which have absolutely nothing to do with one another.</p><p>Viruses are interesting because they introduce us more closely to a molecular schema: alliances that go against nature… but, even if there are other types, aren’t all alliances <em>interkingdom</em> in nature, made between two realms? So that’s what we call <em>a bridge</em>, and that would be the first feature of this type of multiplicity: connections of whatever type between independent series or between lines irreducible to a filiation or a common lineage.</p><p>A student: More slowly please!</p><p>Deleuze: What?</p><p>The student: Not so fast…</p><p>Deleuze: Am I going too fast for you? On the contrary, I’m going to go even faster! … [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [37:43]</p><p>There… now my schema is perfect. Good. See? I’ve got bridges which are themselves connected to each other. Why is this interesting? Because… it’s not that interesting? Why is it interesting? Because it’s a state where there is a swarming of black holes, a multiplicity of black holes that doesn’t let itself… that doesn’t resonate within a central black hole. Why is this?</p><p>Well, in contrast to a feature of molar multiplicities that we saw before, here each element – each black hole if you will — each element is at once emitter and receiver. In the theory of automata – and I insist on this point – everything that cannot be reduced to an arborescent schema implies that each element is both emitter and receiver. So that’s what our schema looks like, and it’s not reducible to an arborescent schema. You see? I have my network, my ring, and my connecting bridges, each time with a black hole that is both receiver and emitter of each element, of each black hole. As a result, you no longer have a hierarchical arborescent structure but a ring.</p><p>Now I’m going to read something by a contemporary specialist who researches certain phenomena in physics. It’s a text that I’d like Guattari to comment on later, if he feels like it… [<em>Pause</em>] Page 906: “If we suppose that clusters have a simple ramified structure like a family tree, we omit the possibility of cyclization”. You see… the phenomenon of cyclization that unites all the elements in a network, such that each is at once emitter and receiver.</p><p>You see that up until now — I wish I had spoken in more concrete terms; I started badly; I should have begun with some concrete examples but now it’s too late — Up until now — maybe I can get back on track — I’ve limited myself to a single multiplicity. But something is happening here. I’m trying to show how in any molar multiplicity something of another nature begins to insinuate itself. It’s still a molar multiplicity but something odd is slipping into it, laying down its bridges, connecting them in networks and rings. But what is this? Don’t be surprised if we have to turn to horror stories as much as to science in order to figure this out. In fact, with my first two notions of bridge and ring (or network), I’ve remained within the context of a given multiplicity, one that is single and determined, a particular multiplicity.</p><p>How do we define it? This is my third notion. How do we define a multiplicity? In the case of a <em>molar multiplicity</em> we define it through – as we saw – a structuring or organizing principle that isn’t given as such. Here, at least, the answer is simple. But in the case of these crafty multiplicities, these discreet multiplicities that insinuate themselves, that we are trying to catch as they insinuate themselves… I can’t say they have an organizing or structuring principle since that’s how I defined molar multiplicities. What defines this kind of multiplicities — and this too is something we covered last year so I’ll be brief — what defines these multiplicities is a certain number of dimensions that they have. These multiplicities are defined through their dimensions.</p><p>But how do you understand how many dimensions they have? Well, they have a maximal dimension. A maximal dimension, each of these multiplicities has a maximal dimension, and here’s where it gets interesting. It’s by determining the maximal dimension of a multiplicity that I am able to say how many dimensions it has. It will have as many dimensions as are contained by the maximal dimension.</p><p>Now what is this maximal dimension? It’s what we can only call <em>borderline</em> and there it is, all at once we’re saved! The maximal dimension of a multiplicity is called <em>borderline</em>. It’s a strange thing, [<em>Pause</em>] it’s a strange things, this notion of the <em>borderline</em>… as that which allows us to define a particular type of multiplicity, a <em>molecular multiplicity</em>, as opposed to the molar type, which is defined through a structuring organizing principle that remains secret, hidden.</p><p>It’s a bizarre thing… If we take say a “fly” multiplicity or a “fog” multiplicity, or a “mosquito” — finally we’re down to the concrete, while still remaining within science — what are these multiplicities?  A fly by itself means nothing. A single fly is a lost fly, that is to say, it’s not a fly. What means something is when we say “flies”.  Félix and I said that the same is true for other beasts, but it bears repeating. One wolf doesn’t mean anything. “Wolves” means something. Or, rather, “wolf” means a lone wolf but the loner, well, isn’t he the border of the wolf multiplicity? Very good.</p><p>If the loner were the border of the multiplicity constituted by the pack of wolves, then we wouldn’t have to think of him as we do normally: as an exceptional individual. But simply, as the <em>borderline</em> determining the maximal dimension of the multiplicity, we shall call the “wolf multiplicity”, which is different from other multiplicities. And what about Moby Dick? Moby Dick, the great white whale? What is he, if not the <em>borderline</em> of the school of whales? Perhaps it always takes a monster to make the borderline, and we have to ask ourselves why this is.</p><p>You may think I have totally abandoned science, but what I’m saying is completely scientific. It’s not surprising that neo-evolutionists think solely in terms of populations. They no longer distinguish species or types. Evolutionary theorists no longer speak of species or types but only of populations. There is no animal species or type, only animal populations or vegetable populations. In any case, the borderline is merely, I’d like… [<em>Deleuze does not complete the sentence</em>]</p><p>And here I have a text by a famous mathematician called René Thom. Oddly enough, René Thom writes… Thom loves opposing military-type aggregates or societies to those of a more fluid nature. Which suits us fine. Military societies are typically arborescent – this too was part of last year’s seminar – power apparatuses are essentially ramified arborescent structures. So we’re OK with Thom’s premise. And he speaks of a multiplicity that suits us perfectly, a <em>micro-multiplicity</em> or <em>molecular multiplicity</em>: a swarm of mosquitoes.</p><p>Here’s what he says: “Every individual in the group moves in an random manner” — that’s not what happens in molar societies or aggregates – “to the point where it can see the rest of the swarm in the same half-space”. [<em>René Thom,</em> Structural Stability and Morphogenesis, <em>trans. D. H. Fowler (Reading, MA: Benjamin Fowler/Cummings, 1975), p. 319; see</em> A Thousand Plateaus, <em>p. 245)</em>] This is perfect for us, you’ll understand… Every mosquito — and here Thom says something extraordinary — every mosquito is the borderline of the multiplicity of a mosquito swarm, and every mosquito in the swarm functions in its turn as the swarm’s borderline. That’s what can happen.</p><p>We saw another case, where a small military-type principle emerges, where the borderline is assured by a chief, a leader of the pack, a squad or gang leader. But in the mosquito’s case, every member of the group moves in a random way, unless it can see the others in the same half-space. Which means that if you follow the route of a mosquito or a fly – obviously it would be different if it was attracted by blood or a piece of flesh – but if you observe its random path, the rule of chance is that every mosquito will move up to a limit position. What is this limit position?</p><p>If we imagine a closed space, the limit will be the point where the mosquito finds itself so as to have all the others on its right, for example…You follow me? At that moment, its position will be on the borderline, and Thom says: “At this point it hurries to re-enter the group. In this example, stability is assured in catastrophe…” — an important concept for Rene Thom, who has a mathematical concept of catastrophe — “In this example, stability is assured in catastrophe by a barrier…” There’s no better way to describe the borderline. A gang or band has a number of dimensions determined by a maximal dimension: the borderline. In the case of the mosquito swarm, the borderline can be precisely defined as the line in function of which a mosquito situated on it will see all the other members of the swarm on one side, at which point it re-enters the swarm.</p><p>It’s interesting, this position of being on the borderline… we should take advantage of it. Being on the borderline, being on the borderline… Being on the borderline means to be part of the gang while not being inside the gang. Being on the periphery, then re-entering the gang before going back to the periphery. But I wonder… isn’t it typical when you are part of a gang, this fact of occupying the position of the borderline? At the limit, as Thom says of mosquitoes [<em>Pause as Deleuze tries to find the quote</em>], as Thom says of mosquitoes [<em>Pause as he continues looking, then sits back trying to remember</em>] ah, yeh, yeh, yeh [<em>Pause as he continues reflecting</em>] … oh I don’t remember, I don’t remember… As Thom says of mosquitoes [<em>A woman student says something</em>] Yes! It’s that every mosquito, insofar as being part of a swarm, occupies the borderline position.</p><p>In a novel – and here I’ll pass quickly on to literature, since I don’t see any difference between a phrase of Thom and one of a novelist, though I see the difference in treatment.</p><p>– Yes… what is it? There are two books by Thom which are easy to find, then there’s an article… let’s see if I have the reference… and a book called <em>Morphology</em>…</p><p>A student: <em>Morphogenesis</em>?</p><p>Deleuze: <em>Morphology</em>… he’s got it wrong… it’s called <em>Structural Morphology</em>… He’s wrong, it happens to everyone…  it’s called <em>Structural Morphology</em> and… I can’t remember, I’ll tell you later… [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [54:00]</p><p>In <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em> we have what Virginia Woolf presents as an extraordinary walk. [<em>On the “walk” in</em> Mrs. Dalloway_, see_ A Thousand Plateaus, <em>p. 263</em>] Each word here is important… and in the words of her heroine she says that following that walk her problems had dissolved, disappeared, she had had many worries, a lot of problems and she realized that these problems were of little account, they concerned the choice of who she should have married, who she should have left etc. And they didn’t make much sense anymore.</p><p>It’s curious that a walk could resolve her problems. It can happen… maybe it’s no longer the same scale, maybe it’s not just a simple walk but a fantastic molecular adventure that have swept away or transformed the burdensome molar position of these problems. Should I marry or remain single, should I stay a man or become a woman, should I finally grow up etc. All kinds of molar problems, but in the end, maybe, there’s a small particle that can make all this collapse.</p><p>And Virginia Woolf, because it’s clearly her, and we’ll see why, she says that during this walk, which strangely takes place among taxis – there’s a continual passing of taxis… It’s interesting because taxis – and I’m not making this up – here I go back to science, and those scientists who have studied the matter closely… Taxis run on what are called semi-random routes, that is, the scientists…  Yes?</p><p>A woman student: Can you speak louder? We can’t hear anything.</p><p>Deleuze: Really… you can’t hear me? …</p><p>The student: [<em>Inaudible reply</em>]</p><p>Deleuze (<em>He pauses to reflect a moment</em>]: The route a taxi takes on a day’s run is like that of a mosquito in its swarm: it’s a semi-random route, because how it continues its trajectory is in part determined by the point where the previous client got off. When a taxi is drawn towards a point on the borderline, where it has all the other taxis on its right, you’ll hear the driver say: “Here I’m going to get lynched!” – which is to say he is in a rough neighborhood where he wouldn’t normally venture. Actually, I hadn’t thought of that, it will be useful later on because we’ll be dealing with a story of criminal machines… but we haven’t got there yet, but we’ll get there.</p><p>So, here we have Virginia Wolf’s walk among the taxis but she’s not <em>in</em> a taxi, she runs into a number of people, and she walks in a way that’s literally the way they say only the English and Americans walk. You know, a walk by Henry Miller — we’ve already talked about this — isn’t the same as a walk by Michel Butor — which isn’t to badmouth Butor… but they don’t walk in the same way. Americans, English don’t stroll in the same way. Henry Miller doesn’t take a stroll around Clichy the way a Frenchman would in New York — unless he has a particular gift for it — it’s different, neither better nor [worse]. Usually, a French stroll would be more molar. The molecular stroll is a curious thing. [<em>On Miller’s stroll, see</em> A Thousand Plateaus, <em>p. 482</em>]</p><p>So anyway, Woolf says, I sliced like a knife through everything… It’s a lovely phrase in a walk, “like a knife through everything”. Then she says — I know it almost by heart since I memorized it last night, [<em>Laughter</em>] since the book was heavy, and I didn’t want to have to bring it along — She also says: “I am a mist”.  There you have a molecular multiplicity. “I am a mist laid out among the people I know”. A beautiful phrase that… even more so because it’s not just literature – that really is how she lived, like a mist laid out among those she knew. I’m like a knife that slices through everything, that plunges into things, cuts between things. I’m… I don’t know what, a mist laid out between people. But then she says: “and at the same time I’m on the outside”, <em>[Pause</em>_]_ and at the same time I remain on the outside. [<em>On this quote from</em> Mrs. Dalloway, <em>see</em> A Thousand Plateaus, <em>p. 264</em>]</p><p>This is an odd kind of position… it has to be explained. How is it possible? It’s strange because I don’t have the words to describe it in terms of a molar multiplicity. If I try to describe it in such terms, what will the binary machine of the molar apparatus say? It will say: “what you doing is pure literature.” You’re either outside or inside – or you’re on the periphery. You are either one of us or a foreigner from elsewhere – or you’ve been placed on sentry duty to make sure outsiders don’t get in.</p><p>And although here we have a third term – we’ve seen it so I won’t go back over it; we studied at the beginning of the year – this third term refers to a binarism, in the form of successive binary choices. First binarism: You’re either inside or outside. Second binarism: You’re (either inside or outside), this time in parenthesis – or you’re a sentry. So there is a first level of choice, then a second, but each time the choice is binary, so the three terms don’t change the binary nature of the choice.</p><p>Thus in terms of a molar multiplicity we will always have to say that this position cannot even be expressed, which is why we need three pages of a writer like Virginia Woolf to try to let us <em>feel</em> it and to try to reawaken a small particle in us – I’m weighing my words here – literally a tiny particle that can say “But of course, this is how I live”. The particle that is always on the borderline of the multiplicity to which it belongs — I can’t think of a more precise formula for the moment — a particle that is always on the borderline of the multiplicity to which it belongs. [<em>On the borderline linked to Woolf’s walk, see</em> A Thousand Plateaus_, p. 29_]</p><p>Yet we still have a small problem. We have two cases: it can be any particle whatever, as in the case of a mosquito, any mosquito whatever, since every mosquito will take up this position. Or it can be a monster mosquito, a mutant. Moby Dick, the head wolf. Ok… for the moment I’m done with the story of the borderline. You can ask me questions in a minute if you like. But I just want to finish this.</p><p>For the moment, I will say that the borderline is perfectly embodied in any particle whatsoever, molecular multiplicities are a kind of multiplicity whose elements remain on the borderline of the multiplicity so formed. So it’s by determining the position of the borderline that you know the number of dimensions the multiplicity has. If you don’t keep to the position of the borderline, you remain stuck in the molar, in the big molar aggregates.</p><p>But keeping to the borderline — you know where I’m heading… — perhaps there is a relation between what we called lines of flight and the borderline. Perhaps there’s a rapport, since the particles on the borderline, and whose path is the borderline… what can we say about these particles? It was through these particles that I defined the multiplicity in question. I can say that they function as a provisional stabilizer, a temporary stabilizer… Moby Dick functions as a temporary stabilizer of the school of whales, the head wolf serves as a temporary stabilizer of the pack. Remember what Thom said? That stability is assured in catastrophe by a barrier that assures a discontinuity in behavior. It’s a question of assuring stability. [<em>On the borderline and the question of stability, see</em> A Thousand Plateaus, <em>p. 245</em>]</p><p>So I’d say that it’s a local temporary stabilizer, but it’s not only that. There’s a whole other aspect to it, namely, it causes the multiplicity slip inside another, that is, through the borderline, on one hand the multiplicity is stabilized, on the other the borderline is in relation with other borders, it prolongs itself through other borderlines, which, since they contain other dimensions, provoke a metamorphosis, a transformation of the molecular multiplicity in question into another molecular multiplicity.</p><p>We began from a single, determinable multiplicity without yet knowing how to define it. Then we noted how it is the borderline that determines a molecular multiplicity. However, molecular multiplicities transform into each other, since their own borderlines communicate across the border, they form with one another. As though they were thresholds, doors from one border to another, such that below a certain threshold the border defines a given multiplicity as a local stabilizer. Whereas beyond the threshold you already have another border defining another multiplicity, and these multiplicities are such that one is transformed into the other. At the limit, we would have to regard this as a kind of slippage of borders, a superseding of thresholds.</p><p>To take a rough example from science that refers to an important question: physicists and chemists are now saying that no ramified arborescent schema takes these kinds of phenomena into account. As an example, they refer to transformations of the type “sol”-“gel”, which is to say the transformation from the state of a solution to that of a “gel”. In “sol”- “gel” transitions, the solution state is actually a type of multiplicity, while the gel state constitutes another type of multiplicity. It’s a question of showing how a borderline surpasses a threshold. They call this the <em>percolation threshold</em>, to employ an admirable term that Félix Guattari learned from some of his specialist friends. [<em>See Guattari,</em> The Machinic Unconscious, <em>trans. Taylor Adkins</em> <em>(1979; Cambridge MA: MIT Press/Semiotext(e), 2011), p. 345 note 11, where Guattari refers to “effects of percolation” as synonymous with “phase transitions”</em>] We have to know why this is. They claim that it’s impossible to translate it in terms of arborescent schema. It’s interesting how here they require a sort of machinic notion in contrast to the arborescent model. This is important but I’ll leave it aside for the moment, though I’ll come back to it in the context of literature, or if you prefer, but… [<em>Deleuze does not complete his thought</em>]</p><p>In chemistry and physics, in the whole field of phase transitions, we see one molecular multiplicity passing into another just as one borderline approaches another. Crossing a threshold, passing through a door – whether a threshold of percolation or something else, it doesn’t matter – but it doesn’t just happen at random.</p><p>I’m almost done so I’ll be quick… This slippage of borders doesn’t happen in all fields but only on condition that the bordering molecular multiplicities change their nature, are transformed into one another. You’ll tell me that we need to provide some examples, fine… [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [1:08:05]</p><p>… so I’ll take a seemingly fantastic example — so much the better — that of werewolves. Werewolves, werewolves… when they die they turn into vampires. So what! – you might say – that’s nothing, it’s not science. But here I’m giving you a foretaste of the literature we will need. Werewolves turn into vampires — I’m not exaggerating — werewolf and vampire stories are of interest to us because the werewolf multiplicity is also a question of the pack. One werewolf is meaningless. It’s a question of epidemic, of contagion. Not filiation. It works. There’s no filiation, we already saw that when we were studying it. There is always a pact of alliance. [<em>On werewolves and sorcerers as well as pacts and alliances, see</em> A Thousand Plateaus, <em>pp. 245-247</em>]</p><p>But a pact of alliance with what? Here’s where demonology can serve us as a transition, a bridge between science and literature. What is the pact of alliance that is made by someone who becomes a werewolf? It occurred with the devil, or a sorcerer. Now what is the devil? With respect to our dear Lord, the good molar creature, the enormous molar creature, the devil is typically molecularized, he’s even named on account of this. The Devil, in his molecular aspect, let me think… he’s called Beelzebub, Lord of the Flies. One of the Devil’s main functions is to be Lord of the Flies, that is, of molecular multiplicities. They didn’t have the term for it then but when they said Lord of the Flies that’s what they meant.</p><p>He has many other names, having many functions, but in the end, what is this alliance with the Sorcerer? I’d say that the Sorcerer or the devil occupies the position of the borderline. It’s the monster, it’s Moby Dick, the Moby Dick of the universe… An alliance is formed, a bridge type of phenomenon an alliance is formed, a bond — we can use several different words — an alliance is formed, and one becomes a werewolf…  But the werewolf is at the same time a full member of a multiplicity. And because this multiplicity is a molecular multiplicity, even if the werewolf is big — I say this because we’re defining our multiplicities through different references of scale or size… — because it’s a molecular multiplicity, being a member of this Pack or multiplicity, the werewolf is always at the borderline of the multiplicity he forms with other werewolves. [Pause] And the werewolves are themselves at the borderline; the aggregate of werewolves, they are at the border of the multiplicity they form with other wolves, the multiplicity of wolves. [<em>Pause</em>]</p><p>But here is where things get complicated. Because when they die, according to many traditions, werewolves become vampires. And vampires belong to a completely different multiplicity. Researching this, it’s interesting how, for example, the werewolf multiplicity, or gang or pack, differs from the multiplicity of the vampire set. Here we have a nice example of the transformation of one multiplicity into another through the prolongation of a borderline where the devil, the sorcerer etc, don’t perform the same function.</p><p>However, one border can slip inside another and there can be a rupture and then another into yet another. Each time you have this meshing of borders… we can speak of fiber – hence the expression many physicists use today, when they speak about the fibers of the universe. This is interesting because the current theory of fibers in physics has established itself in opposition to a typically molar theory: brick theory. Generally speaking, brick theory states that what is most material — physical matter — has the form of brick that enters into the construction of more precarious fragile structures, such as living structures. The theory of fibers is completely different. It consists in establishing lines of continuity between elements that are taken up in terms of their own individuality. For example, the lines of continuity that run from a higher living organism to atoms, which we are told are too tiny to be subjected to the law of large numbers – “too tiny”, we’ve seen this in Schrodinger’s formula – too tiny to be subjected to the law of large numbers. This is important because the law of large numbers, statistics, is still a molar method… [<em>On the theory of fibers, see</em> A Thousand Plateaus, <em>pp. 249-251, 272</em>] [<em>Tape interrupted, end of Part I</em>] [1:14:59]</p><p>Part II</p><p>[<em>Given that a seemingly different drawing is on the board and that different students are sitting behind Deleuze from one part to the next, this segment could be occurring on a different day, despite its evident connection to the previous discussion</em>]</p><p>… I would say that gangs are molecular multiplicities. Not because they are small but on account of their non-molar type of organization. A gang is first of all defined through its borderline and the way that each of its members conducts their business at the borderline: the members of the gang leave, and then they re-enter, each bringing in the swag, and the swag is redistributed. Obviously, there is also a central position. There are centers and it’s because of these virtual centers in the gang that it risks becoming arborescent, going over to the other side, towards a type of organization that resembles a molar aggregate.</p><p>But, generally speaking, everyone in the gang conducts their own business and at the same time it’s everyone’s business. There exist contractual rapports, relations by contract or by alliance, relations of debt, counter-debt, all kinds of weird relationships. I’m told that even in groups of drug addicts there are odd relationships of debt and alliance.</p><p>But what is strange is the way the gang is always threatened, not only from the outside by pressure from the molar aggregates, but also from the inside. Gangs are threatened from the inside by phenomena of massification or leadership, the reconstitution of a central leader or worse, of a kind of group Oedipus. For example, when a woman in the gang takes on a maternal role, she institutes a kind of group mothering. I’ve seen this happen in certain communes, this fascinating phenomenon of group mothering that reconstitutes a center in the group. In this case, it’s as though the molecular multiplicity tended literally to arborify, to molarize itself, to attain the status of a molar aggregate. And this is always the way with molecular multiplicities, not because they are particularly fragile, but because it’s something that occurs in their very movement.</p><p>So, if we define molecular multiplicities by the segments that we’ve looked at – segments of a becoming-animal, a becoming molecular and so on, through the phenomena of the borderline, or of flight — I’m not going to go into that now… — we see they’re always in danger of vacillating, of being had, of going back to the side of the molar aggregates, the way the nomadic war machine went over to the side of the state apparatus even if it had a wholly different nature and function. But it’s the same with today’s gangs, like the War Machines of ancient times, it’s all as though finally… [<em>Deleuze does not complete the sentence</em>]</p><p>There are women in gangs who create a kind of… I don’t know, I imagine many of you have noticed things like that, these phenomena, literally, both how there’s often the two-fold danger of gangs and communities reconstituting both a kind of group mothering and a leadership… which is the reason gangs are always on the verge of becoming fascist, of recreating fascistic formations. In other words, it’s always like this but nothing is certain… You can’t say: “this is where the real revolution is happening”, not at all. There could be a reconstitution of a molecular Oedipus, and a molecular Oedipus is no better than a family Oedipus, a molar Oedipus. In fact, it can even be worse, so for example, you might have a female body that becomes the center of the gang. [<em>On these kinds of reconstitution, see</em> A Thousand Plateaus_, pp. 214-216_]</p><p>I’m thinking of those American gangster films where the gang is led by the big mama. This is the danger the gang faces, that at its center a big black hole will begin to form. Usually this is how a gang collapses, either that or by rupture or a scattering of its members who get fed up, cross over the borderline and become part of another multiplicity, or else reconstitute a molar-type aggregate, even if it’s a small one. Once again you see how our molar-molecular distinction isn’t one between large and small numbers… [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [1:20:47]</p><p>… I would say that leaders in molar aggregates have an organizing function. In molar aggregates we recognize the boss from the central position they occupy, the central black hole. Or, if you prefer, the face, the function of a central faciality. I’m not at all saying it’s an individual; remember that the face function is never a individual function but a social production.</p><p>So there is the central face, like that of Hitler, for example, at the center of fascism, with its little orbiting satellites, little black holes around the big black hole: Goering-Goebbels. There’s this organization, the leader is essentially in a central position, to the point that the law of molar aggregates is always, it seems to me, of a type that tends towards the center, assuring legitimate ambitions, since it’s only by advancing in one’s career that one gets closer to the center. Otherwise, one remains far from the center.</p><p>Here the center is on high because you always have a supplementary dimension in molar aggregates… there is a supplementary dimension in molar aggregates which is of course that of the profile or position of the leader. But it’s an interior and central position to which all the underlings try to get closer, except for those who are under orders to keep watch at the borders, although they’ll be relieved and their compensation will be to be able to see the leader and be led by him, that is to go back towards the center. So this is the position the leader occupies.</p><p>I’m not saying that molecular gangs or groups, molecular multiplicities, don’t have leaders, but not surprisingly we need another word to describe them. There’s one excellent word that I hadn’t thought of last term and here I open a parenthesis. I spoke about Lovecraft because he’s an author I really admire, as many of you do, this American author, American – not English. Anyway, this great American author… what was I saying? Yes, he once wrote a book, no it was a story called… and I know I won’t be able to pronounce it properly — “The Outsider”, “Outsider”, as is said “outsider”. [<em>See</em> A Thousand Plateaus, <em>p. 245</em>] It’s translated in French, very badly as usual. Translators do things… you just need to know a little bit of a language to understand when a translation doesn’t work…. he translated the title as “Je suis d’ailleurs” (“I’m from elsewhere”).</p><p>This is important for us, for what we were saying about the becoming-animal in molecular multiplicities, quoting some passages from Lovecraft. [<em>On Lovecraft’s animals, see</em> A Thousand Plateaus, <em>p. 248</em>] Because in this story, the <em>outsider</em> is what Lovecraft calls “the thing”, the “unnamable”, the human being in its becoming-beast, the becoming-animal of the human. He presents the outsider both as the thing and as a swarm. Remember our couple? The guide and the pack, the two together, Moby Dick and the school of whales, the devil and the pack of wolves and so on… And we understand what <em>outsider</em> means and that it doesn’t mean “I am elsewhere”.</p><p>So what is the outsider? Even in French I have the impression that it means, “the one you don’t expect”. But in what sense? I don’t even need to force language. Literally, it’s the one that exceeds or overflows, that arises from and spills over the border. The border-dweller, the being of the borderline is the unnamable, the one who literally delimits the swarming multiplicity. And if the multiplicity is superseded, it changes its nature and acquires another borderline. That’s what the outsider is.</p><p>I’m saying, this is the position of the leader, but “leader” from the perspective of a molecular multiplicity, which is quite different from the leader’s position in molar aggregates. Here, the leader or guide of a molecular group is the one who is always at the borderline, as in the case of animal packs, where that’s found. We’d even have to see if we didn’t find the two-fold position of the leader in certain packs, already a kind of central leader, or central female, and then the border chief, a border guide who pushes back and guards the frontier. The border chief who stays at the borderline is the great Nomad. The one who stays at the center is the Chinese Emperor, if we want to refer to literature. Operating in a completely different way the nomad is the head of his war machine, which is itself a becoming, a molecular multiplicity, whereas the Chinese Emperor is the nominal head of the State apparatus.</p><p>Although I’m here to defend thought, if someone told me that we need a leader… no, no, I’m… If I tell myself that a leader is necessary – and especially in certain circumstances, it can’t help but occur — it’s a statement that doesn’t mean much to me since, for me, the real question is what kind of leader will it be. Will it be the border-dweller, who will always occupy the position of the outsider? Or will it rather be the one who, in opposition to the outsider, we can call the “champion”, the man of central power who has a faciality function, whereas the border-dweller is typically without face, has literally lost his face? Perhaps he’s the one who makes greater use of secrets.</p><p>So, at this level too, we have to distinguish not only between two types of leader but between the way a molecular multiplicity refers to a pack leader, a peripheral chief, who we could define as an “outsider”, while molar aggregates refer to another type of leader. And we should also add that, faced with certain dangers or in certain circumstances, molecular multiplicities reconstitute leaders of the molar type and do so completely – even if they do it in a different way, depending on whether they rely on a border chief or else reconstitute a central leader typical of a molar aggregate… [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [1:28:56]</p><p>… I find it amusing how we are presented today with the history of psychoanalysis as supposedly beginning it creation, by recounting a number of little tales about what happened inside the school. They’re still cheating, of course. There was a first period which was more or less a period of censorship concerning what happened around Freud and his early disciples. But now we can finally understand what a mess all this was, quite a marvel. It was really one of these groups with Freud was the central leader. Fine.</p><p>But what interests me, once again – this is what I wanted to say earlier — I have no interest in the disciples; the disciples deserved what they got. What interests me is what was happening on the outside during that period. I have the impression that we still don’t really know. What was happening in Vienna around the time of the birth of psychoanalysis… what psychoanalysis, as it began to institutionalize itself, crushed in the different Viennese movements.</p><p>History is normally examined purely in terms of geneses, as though on one hand you had the institution of analysis with its internal problems, and on the other a hostile external environment. But in my view this isn’t what happened. I just want to mention it… but there’s an Austrian scholar who’s been working on the matter for ten years – either he’s given up or there’s too much to say concerning the myriad groups that existed at that time. I’m not saying that Freud was plagiarizing what these groups were doing. I’m just saying that there was a flood of research. We only know of one borderline figure, Groddeck, but it seems there were many types of Groddeck around then, many, many, many. Psychoanalysis, perhaps without meaning to – without pretending to demonize it – was to crush all these movements. I can’t say it was necessarily a bad thing. I’m not saying, “Look what they did.” It rather a question of saying that’s how history always works… [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [1:31:10]</p><p>Part III</p><p>[<em>Again, as with the start of the previous part, Deleuze is surrounded by a different group of students in a different classroom configuration; hence, this seems to be a third, brief segment from another seminar session, which we have situated on the following Tuesday</em>]</p><p>… “They [the waves] told him that every figure of space” — every figure is a multiplicity, that’s what mathematicians say; a triangle is a multiplicity on every side, on all three vertices — “They told him that every figure of space” — therefore every multiplicity — “is but the result of” — I change my tone of voice when I’m quoting — “is but the result of the intersection by a plane [of some corresponding figure of one more dimension—as a square is cut from a cube or a circle from a sphere. The cube and sphere, of three dimensions, are thus cut from corresponding forms of four dimensions that men know only through guesses and dreams; and these in turn are cut from forms of five dimensions, and so on up to the dizzy and reachless heights of archetypal infinity.] [<em>Tape interrupted, citation below</em>] [1:32:09]</p><p>… The world of men and of the gods of men is merely an infinitesimal phase of an infinitesimal thing — the three-dimensional phase of that small wholeness reached by the First Gate, where ‘Umr at-Tawil dictates dreams to the Ancient Ones.” [<em>This citation is from a story by H.P. Lovecraft and E. Hoffmann Price, “Through the Gates of the Silver Key” in</em> The Dream-Quest of the Unknown Kadath <em>(New York: Ballantine Books, 1970), pp. 191-192</em>; <em>cites several times in</em> A Thousand Plateaus, <em>see p. 251</em>]</p><p>You understand? We’re saying that every multiplicity, every molecular multiplicity, can be defined by a number of dimensions. This number is determined by the position of what functions as the borderline of the multiplicity. [<em>For this definition, see</em> A Thousand Plateaus, <em>p. 249</em>] I mean to say that the square and the circle are two-dimensional figures in function of their borderline, which is to say a line. Everything that is bordered by a line will have two dimensions. These are already multiplicities. There will also be three-dimensional multiplicities bordered by a surface and multiplicities of four or five, even ten dimensions. Here are examples of a multidimensional multiplicity, however varied: man, domestic animal-sheep, rat-bacteria, which creates contagion-plague, multiplicities with three types of werewolves, three types of vampires, and so on.</p><p>So, we have multiplicities of any type of dimension that transform into one another. This we’ve already seen. What we call <em>plane of consistency</em> or <em>rhizosphere</em> is the common intersection of all these multiplicities by a plane. You might say, “but the plane too has its own dimension.” No. It has to be a zero-dimensional plane. Not because it doesn’t have dimensions, but because it is able to cut through all the dimensions in such a way that the multiplicities that transform into one another never cease transforming. [<em>Deleuze coughs</em>] And their way of communicating is through this plane. Therefore, on the plane of consistency everything becomes abstract, in the cultural sense of the term. That is to say, the plane of consistency is the bearer of what Félix and I have been turning around this past year: the <em>abstract machine</em>. The universe is a Mechanosphere, not a noosphere or a biosphere. It’s a hypersphere, a Mechanosphere…</p><p>What was I saying? The plane of consistency… ah yes, it’s the abstract machine because it gathers the ensemble of all the assemblages, of all machinic assemblages, of all multiplicities of whatever dimensions – and the dimensions of all these transformable multiplicities must exist precisely on this plane. The abstract elements of a single machine: a single Mechanosphere… [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [1:36:02]</p><p>… Virginia Woolf constructs the unity of her work [<em>The Waves</em>] on a single plane of consistency that advances and gathers all the multiplicities: the Bernard multiplicity, the Neville multiplicity, the Jinny multiplicity. And we have the impression that Percival is the extreme borderline, that Percival, the admirable Percival, almost merges with the plane of consistency. And yet, no. This is not what happens although some might think so. And Percival dies. He dies. [<em>On</em> The Waves_, see_ A Thousand Plateaus, <em>p. 252</em>]</p><p>I brought you this wonderful page of <em>The Waves</em>. One of the characters is Rhoda. Following Percival’s death, she looks into what is a kind of lake where she sees forms appearing. She has the impression that one of these forms on the lake is Percival, even if she knows he is dead. And this is what she says. She describes the form she sees: “When the white arm rests upon the knee it is a triangle; now it is upright – a column; now a fountain, falling. It makes no sign, it does not beckon, it does not see us. Behind it roars the sea. It is beyond our reach.”</p><p>Great, don’t you think? Do you see this kind of curve? The same applies when it’s upright. It passes through all these multiplicities of increasing or decreasing dimensions, of variable dimensions. But they all somehow belong to the same plane of consistency. They’re all there, on this plane of consistency, but in the most abstractly real form, in the forms of pieces and cogs of the abstract machine. So Percival’s white arm will no longer be a knee or an elbow: it will be a triangle. This will no longer be… [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [1:38:47]</p><p>… I didn’t want to present an example from Kafka, but very quickly, I’ll tell you that she [Josephine] occupies exactly the same borderline position. What’s more, we learn that she is undoubtedly a singer, but that she doesn’t sing. [<em>On this Kafka tale, “Josephine the Singer, or the Mouse Folk,” see</em> A Thousand Plateaus_, pp. 233-234_] These are Kafka’s flashes of brilliance. So we shouldn’t confuse becoming-musical with making music, <em>[Pause</em>_]_ just as we shouldn’t confuse becoming-mouse with imitating a mouse. Man becomes mouse and mouse becomes musical, but it’s man who makes music, and what does the mouse do? It’s a mystery. We’ll follow what it does.</p><p>This is what I call a <em>bloc of becoming</em>, the simultaneity of these two asymmetrical becomings. [<em>On blocks of becoming, see</em> A Thousand Plateaus, <em>pp. 237,</em> 307] When I say that there is a becoming-woman of man I don’t mean that symmetrically there is a becoming-man of woman. This was already almost the objection or question that was raised the last time. When I say that there is a becoming-animal of man, somebody said there was also a becoming- human of the animal. Yes and no. In fact, there is a bloc of becoming in which both becomings, both currents, are never symmetrical or parallel. – [<em>Someone passes a sheet of paper to Deleuze</em>] This is some kind of greeting… — Never parallel, never symmetrical, and in which each becomes something different from the other.</p><p>This is extremely complicated, this business of becomings, and we’ll have to explore it further. But in the case of Kafka, there is always a strange music and there’s a precursor for this. And yet he didn’t know the music of his time well, it didn’t interest him. But there are concerts in Kafka… Josephine sings and yet she doesn’t sing. It’s magnificent… [<em>End of the recording</em>] [1:40:51]</p><hr><a href=#lecture-2-surfaces-of-redundancy-black-holes-language-and-orders><h1 id=lecture-2-surfaces-of-redundancy-black-holes-language-and-orders><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Lecture 2: <strong>Surfaces of Redundancy, Black Holes, Language and Orders</strong>  </h1></a><blockquote><p>When Félix plays on [the term, <em>black hole</em>], and this is true of our method as a whole, what we’re formally saying is: these are not metaphors.

This session’s continuity is unfortunately marred by numerous filming breaks causing frequent jumps in the flow of ideas.With reference to work by Pierre Clastres, he emphasizes how one is rendered compatible for enunciation within the system as a whole, i.e. types of state-controlled societies and citizenship, but not necessarily within more marginalized groups, but in either case, specific formations of territorialities are involved. He proposes a rhizomatic system without black holes and yielding a semiotic polyvocality, allowing multiple expressive elements (verbal, bodily, dance, sexual), hence not informatics based but diagrammatic. Deleuze discusses in greater detail the first system, focusing particularly on different senses of “black holes” (e.g., in astronomy), to which he associates the eyes but also consciousness and memories, and then returns to the question of language-power relations and how different models have limited discussing the question, notably ideological, certain forms of linguistics. Deleuze suggests that a different conception of power is required, but one can understand language as a particular formalization of expression whose function is to transmit orders in society. Deleuze shifts position to draw a schema of three heads (information, noise, redundancy), an orders-command schema, concluding that this first system inscribes itself on a semiotic wall, that of signifiance, from which poets and writers attempt to flee. To this redundancy of frequency, he contrasts a redundancy of resonance, that he links to linguists’ use (notably, Émile Benveniste) of the term “shifter”, e.g., redundancy of the personal pronoun. This difference (to resonance) entails distinctions between the subject of enunciation and the subject of the enunciated, which Deleuze asserts are redundancies creating a vortex, a true hole.</em></p><p><strong>Il Senso in Meno, Part 1 —</strong> <strong>Surfaces of Redundancy, Black Holes, Language and Orders</strong></p><p><strong>Translation: Graeme Thomson and Silvia Maglioni; transcription and time stamp: Charles J.

This will tell us not only a person’s physical location but also information about their various behaviors, degree of freedom, earning and spending power etc.  I would say that there’s been a semiotic collapse in the sense that collective modes of enunciation which inextricably wove and articulated together the various semiotic components have found themselves reduced to the point where they can always be translated in terms of a quantity of information.</p><p>The learning of language – the passage from infant to school to professional language and so on – is a process whose aim is to make individuals, however polyvocal their desires, capable of arriving at this possible reduction, which is essential to systems of production and exchange that can permit the circulation only of people who are <em>translatable</em> in terms of information. Otherwise, they must be mad, marginals, poets and what have you. Special tools are used to treat them and they are institutionalized in facilities specifically created to deal with these marginal phenomena.</p><p>This process of semiotic collapse makes it possible nowadays to enunciate any element of one’s desires or lifeworld, provided that it is compatible with the informatics machine of the system as a whole, whether that be socialist, capitalist, bureaucratic, all the state systems – to borrow Clastres’ classification. [<em>On Clastres, see the A Thousand Plateaus seminar V, session 3 (November 20, 1979</em>] So, all of a sudden, the only subjectivity possible is that which renders you compatible with the human species in general, the species of state-controlled societies and of citizenship. Therefore, you don’t have the same rapport with the particularization of enunciations which consisted in saying…. for example, Amerindians… Amerindian tribes say that the only “people” are Amerindians, and when they see white people they say they are not “people”. Their sense of belonging to a community of expression is delimited by the place where there is a mesh of the various semiotic components.</p><p>Excuse me for this awful generalization. I know I’m taking two extremely different points in the social field. So what happens? One can submit to this system of computerized reduction only insofar as territorialities are constituted, what I call <em>surfaces of redundancy</em>, where we can articulate this type of opposition. To give an example: choosing a woman in the kind of societies described by Clastres isn’t simply a question of trying to have sex, or of reproduction, or of possessing somebody… it’s always a matter of the meeting of two social subgroups, implying different systems of exchange, systems of multiple semiotic composition.</p><p>Today, we can say that the selection of a sexual partner – which seems to be a free choice – is in fact determined by systems that compel people to correspond to specific socio-economic profiles. To the point that there are some who try to facilitate this through a computer program that matches people’s preferences. However, one no longer chooses someone from a certain clan with all that this intricate semiotic dance implies. Perhaps one no longer chooses – and here I’m jumping ahead – a body, the possession of the other’s sexual organs – if we want to define it like that – but the possibility of finding a certain type of redundancy: redundancy of survival, redundancy of faciality. We look for someone in the enunciative field that allows us to say something of the order: Tristan-Isolde, Isolde-Tristan. But in a much more sad and sinister way, as in an endless conjugal scene that consists only in the person one is talking to. [<em>On this topic, see</em> A Thousand Plateaus, <em>pp. 132-133 where Deleuze and Guattari speak of redundance and conjugal love</em>]</p><p>When I return, announce my name, and my objective, who is it that resounds the echo of what I’m saying? On which surface of redundancy can I express myself?  In territorialized societies you have large surfaces of redundancy and multiple possibilities of semiotic composition. In the case of conjugal relations, in a deterritorialized, miniaturized subjectivity, one can only latch onto this someone and say: “Do you recognise me when I speak to you?”, “I’ll be back at such and such time”, “That’s what I’m doing”. But the same system operates with children. Even in rapports of faciality, there’s this dissociation, this type of imprinting that ethologists refer to. The rapport of visual contact, the “eye to eye” contact of which Spitz and a number of other Americans speak. [<em>On Spitz, see</em> A Thousand Plateaus, <em>p. 169</em>]</p><p>There’s always a need to frame things. I exist only as long as there is a certain point that serves as a surface of reference and black hole where I can go on articulating my enunciations. If this last surface of redundancy or reference is taken away from me, the whole system of my informational coordinates literally collapses.</p><p>Strangely, we see that this thing psychoanalysts call the partial object — the eyes, the face, the eye-nose-mouth triangle — constitutes an extraordinary safeguard with respect to different individuals, since not only have the various semiotic components (dance, mime, gesture, group rituals and so on) largely disappeared, but also the possibility of the sexual act itself. We get to the point where one can conceive of falling in love with a trait of faciality in a woman, without having the chance to bring into play the various semiotics of love, sexuality and so on. The essential thing is that there be this last hold, this hook of territorialization. So there you have it.</p><p>The second thing we can sketch out for the moment is this: either you have informatics redundancies that latch onto surfaces with black-hole systems such as faciality, state power… In every system of power there’s always a system of black holes – the eyes of Giscard d’Estaing, the eyes of the leader… Something like, “In any case he’s one of us”, “There’s a chance, at least it’s France!”, “I recognize myself there because I’ve already seen him, I can continue speaking, producing meaning” …</p><p>Either you have this system of redundancy-black holes – which is precisely the arborescent system, because wherever there’s a black hole there are trees – and, as we said in the case of dreams, you have the dream’s umbilicus, a place where everything is organized around a central point, a blind spot. Or we can think of another system of redundancy, though in this case it wouldn’t be a redundancy of orders or of subjectivity but a <em>rhizomatic system</em> where there is no black hole or else where the various black holes are bypassed in such a way that we return to a semiotic polyvocality – one no longer subjected to arborescence and the stratification of the various semiotic components, but where every type of expressive element (verbal, bodily, dance, sexual and so on) rather than contributing to the organization of a subject or a couple produces something that I think you (Gilles) are going to unpack, another type of semiotic organization, one that is no longer informatics-based but which we could roughly call <em>diagrammatic</em>. One that wouldn’t be centred around a black hole or pass by way of the mediation of a subject or relationship with another person, but through direct connections between the different semiotic components…  [Tape interrupted] [11:00]</p><p>Deleuze: … since these redundancies of resonance with their faciality, the traits of faciality that compose them, find their outlet, their organization, in this whirlpool system that I called <em>holes</em>… Here, Félix adds a qualification, that we should call them <em>black holes</em>. And I remind you, for those who may not know this… but then you should try to find out more for yourselves, because that’s how we can work together… I remind you that black hole is an expression taken from astronomy. What <em>black hole</em> designates – and Félix will correct me if I’m wrong – is more or less, in the field of relativity… though it depends on which theory of relativity… it’s a star that has passed beneath its critical radius and in so doing, by diminishing this critical radius, surpassing a threshold, has acquired a strange property: it captures what are in this case photons passing nearby and retains them. It captures them and nothing gets out any more. And this is the reason that it doesn’t emit… it doesn’t emit light, it doesn’t emit photons… hence the expression <em>black hole</em>.</p><p>When Félix plays on this, and this is true of our method as a whole, what we’re formally saying is: these are not metaphors. And if we say the face, the eyes are black holes, if we say that consciousness, I-equals-I, is a black hole, then the problem is how to get out of this. As I said before: how do we break through the wall, how do we get out of the whirlpool of the hole?</p><p>It’s not a question of saying black hole in a metaphorical sense. It’s a question of stealing a word, in this case a word from astronomy, ok we’ll take it, we’ll pick it up and we’ll keep it for our own uses but not as a metaphor. We will proceed neither by metaphor nor by metonym. We will proceed by using an inexact term to say the exact thing. Which is: the eyes, the face, consciousness… And we will say: consciousness is a black hole, the eyes are black holes and many other things besides. Memories are a black hole.</p><p>As Félix said, with regard to Proust’s <em>madeleine</em> when somebody raised the matter… “What is this business of the <em>madeleine</em>”? Félix put it admirably. He munches on his <em>madeleine</em>. It’s a redundancy, a type of redundancy perhaps. He has plunged into a black hole. The black hole of memories. How will he get out? Don’t think this is a victory for him. You recognize Proustians by the way they regard the story of the <em>madeleine</em> as a victory. And we recognize the anti-Proustians, those who really love Proust, who suffer for him, saying “Oh no, what a mess he’s getting himself into. How is he going to get out?”</p><p>Well, he’ll get out in his own way, by making a hell of a din. He does what Félix has just said: He makes a <em>line of flight</em> out of the black hole, he bursts, springs out from the black hole exactly the way others manage to break through the white wall, the way Gherasim Luca does. So I think that in the last part of what Guattari said what will be fundamental for us, and he will have to develop it further, is both the topic of faciality and that of black holes… [Tape interrupted] [15:00]</p><p>Deleuze: … In the conception of power that we require everyone, in a certain sense, is a messenger. You’re right, everyone’s a messenger, there’s no front line, it’s clear. So, it’s language itself that is the messenger of a pre-existing order, which nonetheless doesn’t exist outside of language.</p><p>Yolande Finkelstein: Regarding the categorization I was thinking of a parallel with what your friend whose name I don’t remember… who recites his poem…</p><p>Deleuze: Yes, I’m happy to repeat that. I would add that, not by chance, he’s called Gherasim… a well-known first name… Luca, L-U-C-A. He’s written many poems, a number of wonderful collections published by Soleil noir: <em>Le chant de la carpe</em> (<em>The Song of the Carp</em>) and another whose title escapes me… [Tape interrupted] [16:25]</p><p>Deleuze: Today I want to begin like this. I’ve quoted some fairly unremarkable examples of redundancy. But we’re not even sure that this is redundancy. [Tape interrupted] [16:46]</p><p>Deleuze [<em>He reads a text apparently by André Martinet, but it is often difficult to grasp when the reading stops and when Deleuze speaks in his own voice</em>]: “Units of information that are independent and then probable, faced with which we are obliged to make choices. So at the other pole what is there? At the other pole you have what computer scientists call <em>noise</em>.” Already we’re wary and with good reason. We’re not doing computer science here. So it’s good to be diffident. We know that when computer scientists use the word <em>noise</em>, they’re talking about a very particular type of noise. It goes without saying that they oppose to information a noise that is presumed to be non-informative, or that contains the minimum of information, like radio or TV interference. But the noise of a beast that hides in the undergrowth is a noise that is rich in information. Even the noise of interference contains a minimum of information. For example it could be the enemy seeking to disturb a transmission. Even if we assume that it’s a random noise burst, it’s never completely fortuitous. We might consider the <em>pole</em> noise as the opposite of the pole <em>maximal information</em>. [Tape interrupted] [18:38]</p><p>Deleuze: … Redundancy is presented as the diminution of theoretical information that is supposedly <em>a priori</em> by right. But something else appears at the same time. Redundancy is the only way of fighting against noise. Which is to say it’s the only way to save the information from crumbling, from disintegrating into noise. [Tape interrupted] [19:23]</p><p>Deleuze: … Whether it be at the level of letters or that of phonemes makes no difference. A language contains a more or less large frequency of any given letter or a certain phoneme that it uses. For example the frequency of a given letter or phoneme are not the same in French as they are in English. So we can already begin a table of the comparative frequencies of letters or phonemes in a certain number of languages. We’ll call it a <em>zero-order estimation</em>. After which, the following estimation is already a redundancy: the frequency of a letter or phoneme in a given language.</p><p>And then there is another estimation that we can call the <em>first-order estimation</em>. This time we study the frequency of a letter in a given language with respect to the preceding or subsequent letter. In this case too, depending on the language, the frequencies are different. I’ll give you a random example. In French what is the frequency of… we could also imagine a computer performing this kind of research… What is the frequency of the group B-A? That is an A preceded by a B. We could do similar studies in the case of phonemes.</p><p>For the second-order estimation I can look for frequencies concerning three groups of letters. This series of estimations will therefore define a certain type of redundancy… [Tape interrupted] [22:20]</p><p>The diminishing of absolute theoretical information and the struggle against noise… why are these two functions linked? Nothing would prevent absolute theoretical information from falling into pure noise if there wasn’t this regulating force of redundancy, which assures the struggle against noise by diminishing the level of absolute theoretical information.</p><p>So, we have a first schema, a schema of redundancy, where at the top we will put “maximal theoretical information” and below “noise” and between the two “redundancy”. And Martinet concludes: “The presence of redundancy is a way to permit the transmission of signs”, and this happens through the series of estimations of which I just spoke. [<em>For this reference, see</em> A Thousand Plateaus, <em>p. 530, note 30, to Martinet’s essay “Redondance”, in</em> La linguistique, guide alphabétique <em>(Paris: Denoël, 1969), pp. 331-333</em>]</p><p>Then Martinet identifies a second type of redundancy. He says: “Not only is redundancy a way to permit the transmission of signs but there is nothing to prevent it itself from becoming a sign”. There… you see how it constitutes a sign in its own right. Redundancy not as regulator of the transmission of signs – a regulatory process in the transmission of signs, or code for transmitting information – but it itself as a sign. Why is this?</p><p>He says: “It must be so that the user can seek out the redundancy for itself.” So users can look for the actual redundancy. “A means of expression for the individual, of manifestation of group consensus. We will therefore identify a principal function of combating noise, without which any communication would be impossible”. And this is our first case of redundancy. “And then there are secondary uses,” secondary uses, “which are left at the subject’s disposal. Means of expression, of action upon others, of enchantment”… [Tape interrupted] [25:34]</p><p>Deleuze: … Reducing the second type of resonance to a secondary use of the first type may be correct from the perspective of informatics, but we’re not sure that what we are dealing with has anything to do with informatics. And perhaps we can even say that it isn’t correct from any perspective, particularly since it actually forms part of very different systems of signs: the subjective redundancies of resonance and the signifying redundancies of frequency. It’s by no means sure that they form part of the same system of signs. It’s by no means sure that the latter are simply a secondary use of the former. [<em>Pause</em>]</p><p>And there’s another thing that disturbs me and that might disturb us all, but this time it’s not related to the second type of redundancy but to what popular informatics tell us about the first schema. For the moment I’m only going to speak vaguely about this… because I’d like to focus on it later. So you can clearly see that what I want to say about redundancies is that we still aren’t even sure what all these redundancies are. So far so good… [Tape interrupted] [27:22]</p><p>Deleuze: … There’s a lot that can be said about the informative nature of language. A number of linguists have already spoken extensively about it. It’s interesting because the idea that language is by its very nature informative is one that corrupts us to such an extent that… I think of a case like that of Sartre, who at a certain point felt the need… and I don’t think he would say this now… to identify what it was that characterised language, or to be precise, poetry or literature. And he said that literature and poetry begin when there is information. Barthes too once said something similar. It’s very odd to make this kind of affirmation. [Tape interrupted] [28:21]</p><p>Deleuze: … What is it that has completely corrupted, compromised, putrefied even, the question of language-power relations? It’s the bad choice we’ve been left with, which is to say the very conception of power that has been proposed to us.  When we were told, “ah folks, it’s either infrastructure or ideology”, we were already pretty irritated. We were irritated for language’s sake, we were really irritated for language to be stuck with this alternative, even if it was presented in the most sophisticated way imaginable. Although sometimes it wasn’t presented in a very sophisticated way, yet in the end the more sophisticated the presentation the worse it turned out. Because we realised that this question of language was extremely complicated. It’s not infrastructure. No, it can’t be infrastructure. Language doesn’t produce anything. It produces only words. It doesn’t produce goods. No aspect of infrastructure coincides with language.</p><p>So, we wondered if it was rather a superstructure. In other words, is it the state apparatus that decides on language? Difficult to say.  As Stalin said: “No, we’ve changed everything but not Russian, not much at least. Of course, we’ve perfected it. But within certain limits”. So, it’s not the state apparatus. We don’t change language the way we change a constitution or a police force. So, is it ideology? “No”, he said. “It may be the vehicle of ideologies, but it can equally well be the vehicle of other things besides ideology.” So even ideology isn’t a strong candidate.</p><p>So, they said, so really, what is language? We always have to go back to this text because it’s both short and rather wonderful, the text Stalin wrote on linguistics, [<em>See</em> A Thousand Plateaux, <em>p. 525, note 21,</em> <em>in</em> Marxism and Linguistics <em>(New York: International Publishers, 1951)</em>] where he says: “Comrades, you’re wrong. There are those among you who say that language is infrastructure and they are mistaken, they are not looking at the question rationally. Others say that language is ideology and there is a language of the people, a proletarian language, a bourgeois language. I say that this not the case and that you don’t really see what is at issue, comrades.”</p><p>And Stalin goes so far as to say that language is the <em>common good</em> of a nation, and that it ensures the communication of information. It suited him to say that of course, since it implied a conception of power related to our well-known themes of infrastructure, superstructure, ideology and so on. If we were to say instead that language has always been a system of <em>order</em> and not of information… that it is orders we are given, not information that is communicated, it would seem to us that we were saying something obvious. We turn on the TV news and what do we get? In the first place, we don’t receive information, we receive orders. And at school, what goes on? Here too it’s obvious. At school the children don’t receive information… The example of school is… Félix puts it well in a text he wrote… we put language in the mouths of children exactly the way we put shovels and picks in the hands of workers. [<em>See</em> A Thousand Plateaux_, p. 76, for this same formulation_]</p><p>So, fine, that doesn’t mean that language is an infrastructure but that it relates to the field of orders. When the teacher gathers the children together it’s not to inform them about the alphabet, it’s to teach them a system of orders. And we have to add – and here prepared to settle our accounts with the Chomskians which we’ll have to do later [<em>Deleuze and Guattari undertake this in</em> A Thousand Plateaus, <em>plateau 4, “Postulates of Linguistique”</em>] — that their famous phrase markers are above all markers of power. And that a syntax is a system of orders, a system of command that will allow or force individuals to form enunciations that conform to dominant enunciations. And the function of school is primarily this. So, language must be conceived first of all not in terms of information but in terms of order. Not in terms of communicating information but of transmitting orders.</p><p>Clearly, for us, this implies – and I would say this is simple and obvious – that we have to look for another conception of power, because, after all, Stalin is quite right in his remarks. There’s no one who decides syntax. Which means that power is undoubtedly something completely different to the properties of individuals or groups in a given moment. For the time being let’s just say that language is a formalization of expression. Not all expressions pertain to language. Language is a particular formalization of expression whose function is to transmit orders in a society. We know that this implies giving power another conception different from the Marxist conception. In this sense, language, including syntax, is… we can’t even call it an instrument… it’s an element and component of power. So, in this sense, it’s not informative.</p><p>And yet, in a certain way it is. Which is to say that it provides the minimal information and guides the minimum choice necessary for the correct understanding of relative, limited information, relative to the orders that are given. It goes without saying that when someone on the street shouts “There’s a fire!” (<em>Au feu!</em>), it’s better if the kids don’t understand it as “Go and play!” (<em>Au jeu!).</em> So, there is of course information and there are choices and approximations, but which are nonetheless relative to the orders communicated by language. [<em>Deleuze and Guattari give this example as well as the Carroll anecdote that follows in</em> A Thousand Plateaus, <em>p. 76</em>]</p><p>There’s a letter… you know how Lewis Carroll used to write letters to little girls, never to little boys. And there’s a famous letter to a little girl he wrote – which is well known and well translated so we don’t need to read it English which would be difficult for some, myself included. This admirable translation by Jacques Papy that works by equivalences, you can find in various editions of Carroll’s Letters. It describes a situation that corresponds perfectly to what we’ve been discussing. [<em>In fact, the translation into French is by Henri Parisot; Jacques Papy translated</em> Alice in Wonderland]</p><p>During one of his lessons in a high society context, the teacher is at the bottom of the garden. And there’s a first servant who repeats his questions. Everyone knows that a teacher’s questions are really orders. When a teacher asks a panicked child what 2 and 2 are, it’s clear he’s not asking for information, he’s giving an order. And you will tell me, but the child would have to be informed first. Indeed, the child <em>has</em> been informed by a previous system of orders. It’s always the information that presupposes the order and not the other way round. I don’t mean order in the sense of organization or ruling but in the sense of a command.</p><p>So, the first servant repeats the teacher’s question, then there is a second servant who repeats the question repeated by the first, and then a third and so on. And to mark the hierarchy that runs through language, the pupil is at the other end of the garden. And then he sends back his answer. And in Carroll’s letter, which I deliberately didn’t bring with me… you can look for it yourselves if you’re interested… the question is passed down the line, each time completely transformed, because the first servant didn’t hear properly. It begins with “what are 2 and 2”, the first servant deforms it and the question changes, the second deforms it further and the third even more. So what the pupil hears is a completely different question to which he anxiously responds, and the answer goes back up the chain.</p><p>Here we have a whole system in which the choices are always wrong but are nonetheless determined by a chain of order and command. And so the obedient response is sent back up and is more and more wrong. The conditions of information are conditions of reception of orders and commands… [Tape interrupted] [40:23]</p><p>Deleuze [<em>He stands in front of the blackboard, and throughout this sequence, writes the terms between each response to the students</em>] <em>The</em> schema has three heads – [<em>Someone tosses him some chalk from the back of the room</em>] Thank you for the chalk — The schema has three heads — Maximal theoretical information — Noise which completely disturbs the emission and reception of information – Redundancy [<em>Deleuze inserts arrows between each level</em>] There we are. A struggle against the noise, letting us defeat the noise which diminishes at the cost of also diminishing the maximal theoretical information.</p><p>The two go well together, since without redundancy the maximal theoretical information would itself be noise. We are trying, in a crafty, underhanded way, to replace this with another schema. The orders-commands schema… You see immediately where I’m heading. I still don’t know exactly how but I feel… no, <em>we</em> feel… we all feel, that orders-commands – I’m not saying that these are different –that orders-commands contain, comprise and in fact result to be the same thing as redundancies, that an order doesn’t need to be repeated — if we repeat an order, it’s because the order is already redundant — so, redundancy or one type of redundancy is the form of the order as such; it’s the form of command.</p><p>And generally speaking, it shouldn’t surprise us if this is the case. We shouldn’t be surprised when an order is repeated, if this is the way an order is given and received, for no other reason than to show that I have understood well. Like when someone says: “Come on, go and do such and such!” and I reply: “Yes, I’ll go and do such and such!” In this case I am superfluous. I <em>redund</em>, so to speak. But what do I <em>redund</em>? Redundancy… it’s the order itself. “Go and do such and such!” or “Go and play!” <em>(Au jeu!)</em> no… “There’s a fire!” <em>(Au feu!)</em> no… “Open fire!” (<em>En joue le feu!)</em> “Open fire!” The order has to pass down the line. So the general says “Open fire!” or “Weapons at the ready!”, or something similar, and the captain says “Weapons at the ready!” and the sergeant says “Weapons at the ready!” until the order arrives at the poor guys who have to prepare their weapons. But if the order is repeated, it’s because, in itself, it is redundant. The order, the command are forms of redundancy in themselves. Maybe.</p><p>So, [<em>Deleuze turns to the board</em>] we were saying that language is not information but order or command. And we also said that the pure order, the order-command in its pure state, is pure redundancy, absolute redundancy. And this is what we put at the top of our schema. Redundancy is the same thing as an order. So, to repeat: if order becomes redundancy, if it is repeated, it is because it is in itself redundancy. So, repetition as a practice with respect to the order would simply be a consequence of redundancy as iden… [<em>Deleuze corrects himself</em>] as within the nature of the order. It’s not certain, but that’s the sensation we have… there’s nothing we can do about it.</p><p>Here, [<em>Deleuze writes on the board</em>] between the two… — the two what? I don’t know. Between the two… it’s just to make a well-balanced schema. We’ll see. — Between the two we’ll put “information”, which is always relative. If it’s true to say that redundancy is the absolute form of order, we will say that relative information is the limited content of an order in as far as it differs from another order. ABC is not the same thing as BCD. Ok, so we have relative information. You see that the form of order is absolute redundancy. So what follows is relative information. If the order didn’t communicate a piece of relative information, “Do this rather than that”, we would be in the same situation as Lewis Carroll’s teacher and pupil where we have the order that is passed down the line, an execution of the order – and an act of obedience which is completely different.</p><p>Information is merely the relative condition whereby the execution of the order corresponds to the order itself. It’s like an inversion of the informatics schema. Actually, it’s even worse. It’s a completely different field. So anyway.</p><p>Here in this third position what can I put? It’s clear, it’s obvious, it’s obvious, and it’s also clear that this is how it works. Fine. [<em>Deleuze writes on the board</em>] It’s not noise that is an informatics abstraction. [<em>Pause</em>] It’s silence. But what silence? What does that mean? Why introduce silence here? Silence. [<em>Pause</em>] Silence is ambiguous. Because it could be the state of the person who obeys – but that is a silence of language, a silence of language itself that is included in language itself. It’s [<em>Deleuze writes on the board</em>] before, it’s before… it’s what happens between the reception of the order and the response to the order. The captain says: “Load your rifle!” and what follows is a silence filled with the sound of a rifle’s bolt action. And then the soldier says: “Ready, captain”. [<em>Laughter</em>] But there’s another silence, a silence that consists in something quite bizarre: an escape [<em>fuite</em>] from all this. We know this silence. When the captain says: “Ready, take aim, fire!” [<em>Pause</em>] And there’s nothing. [<em>Laughter</em>] Silence… [Tape interrupted] [49:24]</p><p>Deleuze: … There’s no great composer who doesn’t have their techniques of silence. Here we can say something that everyone who listens to music will already be familiar with. Which is that music is traversed by a sort of vector of abolition. A vector of sonic abolition. As though it was completely intrinsic to music. The will and the movement to be extinguished [<em>s’éteindre</em>], and to extinguish us with it. Like a kind of tracing of abolition. And sounds – which are not a language, even if in music too there are orders but music flows underneath these orders that are properly musical – trace a line of abolition that is fully part of the music… and they do so in many ways.</p><p>This first system of signifying redundancy, or redundancy of frequency, inscribes itself on a semiotic wall. And the attempt to pierce this wall… we’ll call this attempt exiting from the signifier, from <em>signifiance</em>. Just as Gherasim Luca does.</p><p>And then I’ll make a brief mention of the second type of redundancy. Obviously, once again, these are not secondary uses of the first type. This time we’re dealing with redundancies of resonance. Of course, we already know something in advance: that everything mixes, everything is mixed. There are no frequencies that don’t have resonance and vice versa. So it’s not a duality, even if it would be easier to proceed as if that were the case. Though if you tell me that it’s not a duality, I’ll say, no it isn’t. But at the same time, yes it is. And if you tell me it is, I’ll say no it isn’t.  Let’s try to work things out from there.</p><p>Redundancy of resonance: what is it? As we saw, it’s not a secondary use. To use the language of linguists we would say that it’s neither a <em>phoneme</em> nor a <em>morpheme</em>, nor is it a word. So, what are we dealing with? Not surprisingly, the last two examples of redundancy that I quoted refer to something linguists call… something we’ve talked about at length… something they call “shifter”. Which is the redundancy – I-equals-I – of the personal pronoun. And the Tristan-Isolde / Isolde-Tristan redundancy of the proper name.</p><p>And you know generally what the linguists call shifters. These are terms that designate those who are literally their bearers. The “I” designates the person who says “I”. This is not the case for other words, it’s not the case for common names. The dog in this case is not the word “dog”. But the word “I” designates the one who enunciates “I”, and we speak of this as a “shifter.” The proper name designates its bearer. Therefore, the proper name – like the personal pronoun, the “I” – are very special things that animate the second of the categories of resonance. And we’ve seen that our two examples of categories of resonance are probably closely connected – just like our two examples of categories of frequency. We have this consciousness that says “I-equals-I”, or we have this couple who say “I love you – I love you” or “I hate you – I hate you” or “I love you – I hate you” or “I hate you – I love you”. A redundancy. Or “Tristan – Isolde” … [Tape interrupted] [54:39]</p><p>Deleuze: … Is this schema the same? Once again, what we had in the first schema was: redundancy of frequency, signifier inscribed on a semiotic wall, and the problem was how to pierce this wall to arrive… at something that might no longer even be semiotics. In any case, it will be an unformulated semiotics. In the other case – here I take up a hypothesis that Guattari is currently developing… is it the same case? Perhaps, but for our purposes it’s better to make distinctions. [Tape interrupted] [55:25]</p><p>Deleuze: … This time the schema seems to me a little different. — Oops, I’ve lost the chalk… Thank you! — Tristan – Isolde. Or else we have “I-equals-I” … I would say that this time, in the redundancy of resonance, the resonance is assured by the elements in question – I and I… or in more technical terms “the subject of enunciation” and “the subject of the enunciated”. Tristan and Isolde, successively “subject of enunciation” and “subject of the enunciated” in their respective mouths. “I, Tristan, enunciate you Isolde”, but also “I Isolde enunciate you Tristan”. The subject of enunciation and the subject of the enunciated in the two cases of redundancy of resonance were as if attracted in a kind of vortex, a true hole. [<em>Pause, he draws a circle with a spiral within it</em>] They started to whirl around, to heat up inside this hole, [<em>Pause, he begins whispering slowly while making a circular movement with his hand</em>] I, I, I, I, I, I, … Tristan, Isolde, Tristan, Isolde, Tristan, Isolde, and the boat sails on, and the boat sails on, Towards what? Towards death. [<em>Pause</em>] The cogito doesn’t have a very bright future ahead of it. [<em>Laughter, he turns toward the board smiling</em>] In appearance, it’s a formally different system.</p><p>I had, and here I would like to end: redundancy of frequency, signifier operating on a wall, a semiotic wall, with the crucial question of how to break through the wall. And here I have redundancy of resonance or subjective, that refers to a hole.

At first there was the repetition of the little phrase. The rest was a bit blurred and he couldn’t really seize it. For the first time he realizes that regarding the rest of the piece: “There were marvelous ideas in it which Swann had not distinguished at the first hearing and that he perceived now, as if they had divested themselves, in the cloakroom of his memory, of the uniform disguise of novelty.” An example of deterritorialization is certain musical signs that don’t function in systems of morphemes or phrases or systems of mathematical signs that function in equations, but that refer back to phrases or realities like those we experience in perception.</p></blockquote><p><em>Guattari begins by discussing the scene in Proust’s <em>Swann’s Way</em> with Swann deepening his understanding of the composition by the fictional composer, Vinteuil, (cf. <em>A Thousand Plateaus</em>, pp. 185-187) and emphasizes how certain elements of the musical phrase stand out with certain musical signs becoming deterritorialized. He then shows how Swann appreciates Vinteuil’s creation without falling into a black hole but rather taking it within him as material presence, and how the musical phrase reorganizes the subjectivity of the people around Swann in the salon. Deleuze discusses the black hole into which Swann’s life collapses, the love-passion black hole, linked to Swann’s interest in painting and to the redundancy of faces, shifts linked to the musical line inspired by Vinteuil’s phrase. Responding to students’ comments, Deleuze emphasizes how these shifts are situated within the social territoriality of the Verdurin salon, but the session is disrupted by disagreements between different students, and despite an attempt by Georges Comtesse to bring the discussion back to Proust and faciality, another student (tentatively identified as Éric Alliez) completely disrupts the session by introducing a scattershot political tirade, which eventually evolves into a shouting match between him and other students.</em></p><p><strong><em>Il Senso in Meno</em>****, Part 2 – Proust, Faciality and Power</strong></p><p><strong>Translation: Graeme Thomson and Silvia Maglioni; transcription and time stamp: Charles J.

And this backfires on him. He’s completely terrorized, but at the same time fascinated because something appears: the little phrase no longer functions as a node of resonance that would fill in the wall of daily life but begins to live and throb in another way. First of all the musician plays it in its entirety, while traditionally only some elements of the phrase were kept, and a whole part was lost.</p><p>Proust, or rather Swann, says that “there were marvellous ideas” in its development. At first there was the repetition of the little phrase. The rest was a bit blurred, and he couldn’t really seize it. For the first time he realizes that regarding the rest of the piece: “There were marvellous ideas in it which Swann had not distinguished at the first hearing and that he perceived now, as if they had divested themselves, in the cloakroom of his memory, of the uniform disguise of novelty.”</p><p>An example of deterritorialization are certain musical signs that don’t function in systems of morphemes or phrases or systems of mathematical signs that function in equations, but that refer back to phrases or realities like those we experience in perception. I won’t go into this right now because I don’t want to dwell too much on deterritorialization…</p><p>Gilles Deleuze: Regarding this question, I’ll take up the example that Félix has just quoted of the monocles in the second part of <em>Swann in Love.</em></p><p>Up to then Swann had seen some faces, like the face of Odette. He needed to feed Odette’s face with pictorial reminiscences. A face by Botticelli. Then there was a kind of layering of the one on the other. One might say, looking for a logical definition, that the faces were seized in their territoriality. They were understood at first as faces – either faces on a canvas or faces in flesh and blood. This is the state of territorialization of the face, which like everything else has its territorial states.</p><p>In the second moment, at the end of the love story, Swann becomes immersed in something completely different, when he goes to a reception. There what he begins to see are no longer the faces of the valets but an actual defection of those valets’ faces that forms a kind of line. And he says this in the text, I remember…</p><p>Guattari: I’ll read it afterwards.</p><p>Deleuze: Yes, you can read the quotation later. What he more or less says is that those faces lost the normal faculty they would have had – it goes without saying this means territorially – of making someone recognizable… “Oh, it’s you, how are you?” They were just a system of lines. Let’s just say this for the moment. It’s a kind of state in which the face becomes deterritorialized. Then Swann enters the salon, and the same thing happens with everyone there. Here you have the series of monocles.</p><p>The monocle or a scar or a pair of glasses are normally themselves part of the cycle of ordinary redundancies. Glasses as a redundancy of the eye, monocles as a redundancy of the eye. They’re both ways of territorializing the face. Here, on the contrary, a line of deterritorialization is created, in which the whole of art is brought into play, as well as a new comprehension of Odette. It’s no longer art that falls back on her face, it’s her face that ends up dissolving. So, in this sense, we use the expression <em>line of deterritorialization</em> when this upending of the face occurs. The face is wrenched from its territoriality. It’s no longer a face. But as Félix says, it melts into traits of faciality. And that’s not all. What will these traits of faciality become?</p><p>A student: Isn’t this portrait a bit like a mode of disinvestment?</p><p>Guattari: Oh, no, not at all. Precisely not!</p><p>Deleuze: There’s the same degree of investment in the other.</p><p>The student: You mean in Odette. But what about disinvestment in Swann?</p><p>Deleuze: Ah… That’s accompanied by the disinvestment of Odette herself.</p><p>The student: But the final word of Swann’s love for Odette isn’t something we can take for granted, after all he marries her, actually after the conclusion of <em>Swann in Love.</em></p><p>Deleuze: Ok, I’m going too fast. Thanks…</p><p>Guattari: Ok, listen, I just want to link that with what I’ve prepared, and then we can pick up again this particular discussion about investments. Even if Proust sometimes has the temptation to refer to things as entities of a black-hole type – such as memory – here suddenly he’s tempted to step into the shoes of the musicologist, as he attempts to make a dichotomous analysis of the little phrase. And he says: perhaps what gives me “that impression of a frigid and withdrawn sweetness” is the “closeness of the intervals between the five notes” and the “constant repetition” of each one of them. Then he stops and says, no it’s a “mysterious entity,” it’s something else, a different universe. [<em>Proust,</em> Swann’s Way, <em>trans. C.K. Scott Moncrieff and Terence Kilmartin, revised D.J. Enright (New York: The Modern Library, 1998), p. 496</em>]</p><p>There are different universes, species of bodiless entities created by artists like Vinteuil. And he accepts them as such. He says it’s an experiment. They’re not ineffable beings. He evokes the experiments of Lavoisier and Ampere. [Swann’s Way, <em>p. 499</em>] Vinteuil has experimented with something quite extraordinary here. Proust says, “even when he was not thinking of the little phrase, it existed latent in his mind on the same footing as certain other notions without material equivalent, such as our notions of light, of sound, of perspective, of physical pleasure.” [Swann’s Way, <em>p. 497</em>] And here he has a kind of anti-cogito reaction. He recovers, he doesn’t fall into the black hole, and he says how usually the soul is something we think about as similar to nothing. But then certain composers show us the theme they have discovered, of showing us “what richness, what variety, lies hidden, unknown to us, in that vast, unfathomed and forbidding night of our soul which we take to be an impenetrable void.” [Swann’s Way, <em>p. 497</em>] And at this point he says, we can’t doubt the existence of this kind of, I would say, machine, of this machinic bloc, we can’t doubt it any more than we can “doubt the luminosity of a lamp that has been lit”. [Swann’s Way, <em>p. 498</em>] It’s as if he was questioning the reductionist procedure of Descartes. He says that what is at stake here is “an order of supernatural beings.” [Swann’s Way, <em>p. 497</em>]</p><p>The last point regarding this deterritorialization beginning from the musical phrase is the loss of the subject, the loss of the subject that is already sketched out in the iconic component through the redoublings, the lines, the proliferation of character portraits. Here, all of a sudden, the little phrase becomes the subject of the enunciated. It’s the phrase itself that begins to speak, and the little phrase looks at the people around it, judges them, has its own opinions about their state of mind. It completely changes position with respect to the previous subject. There’s a new assemblage. It’s the little phrase that reorganizes the subjectivity of the people gathered in the salon and that of Swann himself…  [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [8:20]</p><p>Guattari: … He describes a dream; in the dream we see the traits of faciality completely collapse: at a certain moment, he sees Mme Verdurin “who fixed her astonished gaze upon him for an endless moment” – so he goes back to the Verdurins as if nothing has happened – “during which he saw her face change shape, her nose grow longer”, and he sees her sprouting a large moustache. Swann is horrified, he turns and sees Odette who is as she was before, tender, loving, her eyes are in tears “eyes welling with affection”, and he says, these eyes “are ready to detach themselves like tears and to fall upon his face.” [Swann’s Way, <em>p. 539</em>] The eyes are just about to fall on Swann.</p><p>Everything is replayed in an enormous wave of tenderness. But then Odette says: “I have to go.” Swann is speaking to Mme Verdurin, and Odette leaves without fixing another appointment with him. She leaves together with Napoleon III who happens to be there. The series of monocles continues, the series of generals, of moustached faces. And in that moment, the whole of faciality collapses, and with Odette, it’s over, and Swann says: “he hated Odette, he would gladly have gouged out those eyes which a moment ago he had loved so much, have crushed those flaccid cheeks.” [Swann’s Way, <em>p. 539</em>] [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [9:46]</p><p>Deleuze: How does his life fall into a hole all of a sudden, without him foreseeing anything? Why all at once? It could have been something else and not Odette and Swann. Last Tuesday we spoke about black holes. [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [10:04]</p><p>Deleuze: … Let’s imagine that there’s a moment that functions like a black hole and like subjective redundancy. We will have to go back to the text… If you’re interested it’s a good chance to reread some passages of Swann. It seems to me that the system of redundancy: Odette-Swann continually reappears…  [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [10:37]</p><p>Deleuze: … In Swann’s case, what interests him above all is painting. When he sees a little maid, he thinks of… it’s a strange thing, because this really is redundancy, redundancy of resonance. I need it to remind me of something. If it doesn’t remind me of anything I’m lost. For him the essential thing is that a thing reminds him of a great painting. Then it works. So, what does he do? In the centre you have… I’m simplifying… in the centre are the two faces. But there’s a crisis here. It’s not so simple. Once again, let’s not forget our method. There’s no good or bad. We can’t say black holes are no good. It’s not easy to make yourself a black hole. It’s love-passion. [<em>On love-passion, see</em> A Thousand Plateaus, <em>pp. 133-133, and for Swann, pp. 186-189</em>]</p><p>So, we have these two faces: Odette and Swann. And it doesn’t entirely work. It envelops, following a line of life. Swann resorts to his procedure, surrounding it with another line, the line of art, so as to close it in completely, and to constitute the black hole of love-passion. So, we have Odette-Botticelli, Botticelli-Odette. This changes everything. She reminds me of something… Redundancy. The redundancy of Odette’s face and Swann’s face. The redundancy of the flower given by Odette and the flower given by Swann. [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [13:00]</p><p>Deleuze: … The line of art intervenes to surround and to guarantee the enveloping of the lived line, in such a way that it clearly reminds me of something. Swann is really sucked into the black hole. But then he makes this astonishing encounter, which doesn’t form part of his procedure. All this is part of lived experience. Our procedures are always surpassed. We use them to surpass what doesn’t work in experience and then they themselves are surpassed by something that is perhaps like a proper name. Swann hears Vinteuil’s little phrase. It’s a third line, a musical line. Vinteuil’s little phrase has moved him.</p><p>But in which form has it moved him? It has moved him because he says to himself: “All this is unexpected. It’ll allow me to go right to the end of love-passion. And he uses it as a kind of third line that will bind all the lines. It will assure the love-passion black hole and will have, to go back to my drawing from earlier [<em>Deleuze moves to the board</em>] — I don’t know, what was it I did here, well anyway – [<em>In what follows, he traces with his finger across the previous drawing</em>] Swann, Odette, their tumbling towards the black hole of love-passion through the lived line of the two faces, the necessary pictorial line, the musical line – and there has to be a system of perpetual redundancy from one line to another. To the point where, at this level, Vinteuil’s little phrase will be ripped from the piece it belongs to. It will have a value, like a signature tune on the radio or TV.</p><p>Vinteuil’s little phrase springs up and Swann looks at Odette. Odette looks at Swann. The phrase makes redundancy with the pictorial signs; it makes redundancy with the faces to the point where it becomes a sign between the two, to the point that he doesn’t give a shit about the rest of Vinteuil’s great sonata. “Ah, my little phrase!”, Odette winks. “Do you remember our little phrase,” and he says: “Yes, the little phrase”. It’s the system of subjective redundancies… [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [16:07]</p><p>Yolande Finkelstein: I’d like to say something.</p><p>Deleuze: About the drawing? Ok.</p><p>Finkelstein: There’s a drawing I’d like to make.</p><p>Deleuze: Ah, you have the chalk…</p><p>Finkelstein: It goes like this: Odette, Swann, and from then on it’s the same drawing as the one you did. Meaning that from now on… I can’t even say it.</p><p>Deleuze: You feel you want to add a vertical line.</p><p>Finkelstein: I mean there is a separation…</p><p>Deleuze: Ok, ok.</p><p>Finkelstein: There’s a separation, here’s Odette, here’s Swann, and on each side, we can make the drawing you made but there’s a moment when…</p><p>Deleuze: We’ll deal with it like that.</p><p>Finkelstein: … when there’s a terrible fracture, which isn’t of the same order as the relation between art and music.</p><p>Deleuze: Indeed, we need that for the second moment. We can add it. Without further commentary. Like that it’s perfect.</p><p>Finkelstein: Yes, those are across. [<em>Referring to the connecting lines that Deleuze draws</em>]</p><p>Deleuze: There you have it. That’s the cowardice of women for you.</p><p>Another student: Let’s suppose that Swann’s signs of love for Odette, let’s suppose a superposition of sense for the signs of the Verdurins’ salon. In that case all the signs of love emitted by Swann towards Odette enter not into a deterritoriality, but in a territoriality of the signs of Verdurin. So, well no…</p><p>Deleuze: Fantastic! I think that suits me perfectly. We need this. As you said, in the first moment it’s the system of black holes that belongs to the territoriality of the Verdurins, with some nuances.</p><p>The student: But this screws up the possibility of speaking of aesthetics and of Swann’s aestheticism. What does Swann’s aestheticism mean? For us Beethoven, or Wagner for the Verdurins relate to a single sign of communication. And the same occurs in the case of the Guermantes. That’s why we can’t speak about deterritoriality.</p><p>Deleuze: You’re going too fast; you’re going too fast.</p><p>The student: The things is that Swann plays alone when the real refuses to play. Or he plays in his own way perhaps. A lot of words like “aesthetics” or “reality” become pointless.</p><p>Deleuze: Wait a minute… Why do you think that Swann at this level, why is Swann always presented as a dilettante and not as an artist? Swann isn’t Vinteuil or Vermeer – he’s a dilettante. A dilettante is someone who makes a territorializing use of aesthetics or art. He’s interested in it only insofar as it reminds him of something. On this point, you’re completely right – he’s in the territoriality of the Verdurins.</p><p>But even more so his love for Odette is seized by the Verdurins’ territoriality. What characterizes Swann’s aestheticism is that he still makes territorializing use of art. The little phrase – he makes a territorializing use of this phrase – ends up being bound to the perfume of the chrysanthemum… of a flower, so he makes a territorializing use of it between himself, Odette and this flower. So, from one end to the other, you’re completely right as far as this moment is concerned.</p><p>But then there’s another moment where we wouldn’t say the same thing. What happens in this second moment that Félix described, if I try to connect it to the first? A strange thing happens. For a million reasons beginning with the sorrow or whatever Proust describes at length. And here the line – in this case it happens to be the pictorial line – begins to flow. And it’s then that Swann begins…</p><p>Another student: Can you erase the rest of the blackboard?</p><p>Deleuze: It’s not worth it. It has one advantage, it’s quite clear like that. It wouldn’t change anything if… And so… it’s at that very moment that Swann begins… not to become an artist, he will never be one, but to understand what an artist is.</p><p>The student: Which is to say?</p><p>Deleuze: Which is to say that the musical line announces it, more and more. This other line, no longer pictorial but musical, will have a value in itself. It no longer depends on instruments. Instruments may embody it, but they don’t bring it into being… [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [21:50]</p><p>Deleuze: … It starts to flow of its own account, <em>sine materia.</em> Proust, who by the way rarely uses Latin, uses a Latin word here. If he uses a Latin word, it’s clear he’s deterritorializing himself. So it’s the instruments that depend on music and not the other way round. Painting begins to fall away; it’s not even painting anymore and the faces become deformed. There’s a deterritorialization of faces, a deterritorialization of the musical phrase. And also, a deterritorialization of the love for Odette, and this deterritorialization of the love for Odette will be expressed in the idea of Odette at the other end of the world… [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [22:44]</p><p>Deleuze: … The problem we posed from the beginning, whatever digressions may have occurred — though I would add that, today, they aren’t really digressions — the problem we’ve been dealing with from the very beginning is to try to understand how a particular type of power — the power of the face — is constituted and how it functions. For this reason, I found it opportune to briefly mention earlier how a society doesn’t just function through the cop’s truncheon. You have to be an idiot if you think that. It also functions through a cop’s face; it functions through the teacher’s face. Kids at grade school say: “Ooh, the teacher looked at me”.</p><p>The student: And what about the blackboard?</p><p>Deleuze: Be quiet and let me finish. [<em>Pause</em>] The blackboard isn’t me. [<em>Laughter</em>] “The teacher, the teacher looked at me, she looked at me!” There’s a power in that. It’s not a matter of generating power from the face but of saying that the face or faciality is caught up in systems of power. We have to analyze it like — but no one’s forcing us, we could speak about something else if you like, fine — we have to analyze it as a cog in certain mechanisms of power… [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [24:27]</p><p>[<em>During this break in filming, someone seems to have insisted that Deleuze respond rather than another student, to which Deleuze reacts with astonishment, although seemingly with good humor</em>]</p><p>Deleuze: [<em>Noises of students around Deleuze</em>] … Incredible. [<em>Laughter</em>] Incredible this reaction that consists in telling me that it’s my responsibility to answer when someone speaks. I don’t see why I should. Sibony, go ahead and speak, go ahead. Don’t let them treat you like that.</p><p>Daniel Sibony: I don’t really see the problem. Actually, there is no problem. We’re trying to speak about how things really function, how they really work. Speaking about the face of the teacher, I have a feeling that this is really new!  This is speaking seriously about power, and power, that is, that functions really, how that, how that, when you are inside it, how we operate within it, how we are within it, how that works… [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [25:18]</p><p>Sibony: I was speaking about the face of Giscard d’Estaing… Will you listen? Let me… either ask a fucking question or let me finish my sentence!</p><p>Another woman student [<em>shouting at Sibony</em>]: [<em>Indistinct, repeated command</em>]</p><p>Sibony: Let me finish! Please, let me finish, I won’t take long. I simply wanted to say that we can speak about the face or the voice of Giscard d’Estaing in a way that can be very useful, and it certainly doesn’t mean, I don’t know, being interested in what’s happening in the metro or what’s happening currently in prisoners in jails.</p><p>Another student: That’s a topic for practical class sessions, my friend.</p><p>Sibony: No… [<em>The students make even more noise, preventing him from speaking</em>]</p><p>A woman student: Can’t you stand up so we can see your face? [<em>Laughter and noise from students</em>]</p><p>Another student: His face. [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [25:58]</p><p>Deleuze: … What Félix and I are proposing are things we have already written. We’re giving back to you our old tricks. I am saying this is defamatory [<em>Deleuze laughs and sits down</em>] … [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [26:18]</p><p>A student: The inspectors on the metro, the people in prison, the CGT [General Confederation of Labour] …</p><p>Deleuze: These people don’t have faces in your view?</p><p>The first student: In a Fascist kind of way but one finds faces that are only visible … [<em>indistinct words</em>] And at Vincennes, compared to how it used to be, we just have pointless conversations. I don’t know why I came.</p><p>Other students: [<em>Indistinct comments</em>]</p><p>The first student: Whether the conversations are pointless or not, compared to other conversations…</p><p>Another student: I mean, we’re all in the metro, we all take the metro.</p><p>The first student: Yes, but there, Vincennes in relation to what it was seems to me particularly hard to bear.</p><p>Another student: No, come on, listen, we’re fed up with this.</p><p>Deleuze: No really what they are saying is good, for someone to say… sorry, you’ll speak in a minute…</p><p>The student: [<em>He continues while blocking Deleuze, unclear words</em>]</p><p>Deleuze: If he says… in fact, if he says…</p><p>A woman student: Why do we bother closing the door, we’re being watched all the time, by spies. Everybody’s spying through their face.</p><p>Another student: The problem is that the spies… [<em>unclear words</em>]</p><p>Another student: Everyone judges through faces…</p><p>Another student: It’s been two years that I’ve wanted to say that.</p><p>Another student: All that’s been said already, it’s stupid…</p><p>Students: [<em>Different voices, unclear words</em>]</p><p>Yolande Finkelstein: No, but I mean, for me, it’s the first time I’ve come to this class. I haven’t been coming for two years. I mean, I don’t know, what’s going on here?</p><p>Another student: We are coming here… [<em>Unclear words</em>]</p><p>Yolande Finkelstein: When I say “here” I mean… [<em>Pause, voices</em>] Anyhow, when Deleuze talks, he talks about certain things, and then suddenly, one day something happens and all hell breaks loose, about Power relations, stuff like that, another thing… what’s going on? So, there’s some individual thing which suddenly is about power relations, other stuff, vague, ambiguous stuff. So, how does that work as well? everyone functions as well…</p><p>Another student: Well, that is the question! … [<em>Diverse voices, unclear words</em> [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [28:01]</p><p>Guattari: … [What we’re trying to do here] is to dismantle things and to find tools and modes of orientation different from those of psychoanalysis or Marxist principles, with the result that we sometimes take certain liberties gabbing about Proust or whatever without having to censor ourselves like what goes on in the army. Maybe we’re even taking the shortest route. I’ve no idea. [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [28:23]</p><p>Yolande Finkelstein [<em>addressing the student who spoke about metros</em>]: No, but I’d like to answer him…</p><p>Guattari [<em>speaking to the student who has mentioned the metros</em>] You’re saying that that works, so let’s talk about it. I don’t think that it’s …</p><p>Yolande Finkelstein: But I want to say something to him… Considering what you were saying about the street, the metro, the prisons… there are some interesting things happening now. On the bus a few years ago, there used to be a driver and a ticket inspector at the back that you showed your ticket to. Now there’s just one person on the bus. And what does he do? He’s both driver and cop. And the other day I heard a driver say quite explicitly: “I have eyes everywhere. That’s why I’m here!” If you don’t show him your bus pass or whatever, he knows it, you see. In the same way that when you go to a store or supermarket, the cashiers and the salesperson don’t just sell you their merchandise, but they also know why you’re there, meaning whether you’re going to buy or shoplift.</p><p>And in relation to this it seems to me, I don’t know, that in the Communist Party, for example… I’m probably talking shit, but I don’t really give a fuck about the PC… but it seems to me that in the places where we meet to talk, we don’t really talk, and that, for example, there don’t seem to be certain moments, in the bus or in the supermarket, or, fine… to deactivate these mechanisms. That’s extremely important. After all, what is it that we are living every day?</p><p>Deleuze: For myself, I’d say that, actually, what we are living every day is…</p><p>The student [<em>to whom Yolande was speaking</em>]: You’re saying that it’s visible from one’s face?</p><p>Yolande Finkelstein: No, I’m not saying that it’s visible from someone’s face… [<em>Pause, voices</em>] I’m not saying it’s visible from someone’s face because when I walk into the supermarket, all the shopgirls are going to move in on me before I’ve taken anything at all! [30:00] [<em>Huge laughter; Deleuze stands rubbing his face</em>] [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [30:08]</p><p>Deleuze: … The faces of the cops are not just the ones behind their truncheons, they’re not just in the street. And there doesn’t even need to be a teacher. There is a presence. That’s why we use this word, faciality. It’s not metaphysics, so what is it? It serves to indicate that the face doesn’t need to be present in flesh and blood. The teacher can very well leave the school. There will still be something. A cog of power that doesn’t need to be embodied in actuality. So, we might wonder, does it function as a super-ego? A number of psychoanalysts would say it does. Or you too might think so… But what about us? We think that notions such as super-ego are completely worthless and that cogs of power don’t function in this way. So how do they function? And then, some people ask, where does all this lead to? It leads to a choice. To make them function or to make them dysfunctional. To analyze the power relations that are established in a room and not only these. We’ll have to wait until the next lesson which will be of an entirely different nature. All that, as they say, is politics… [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [31:48]</p><p>Georges Comtesse: Considering what you say, what you think, what you think about Proust… in your view, what is it, at the moment of the face collapsing, of the rupture of the anchoring point that fixes it to the territory… what is it that in that moment, in that collapse, makes hatred arise?</p><p>Guattari: Roughly speaking, it happens when the eyes go blind… [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [32:23]</p><p>Guattari: … At the last moment he tries to reconstruct Odette’s faciality, and all the facialities take off, with the business of the monocles, the nose that elongates, etc. At that moment, in this way, he knows he has to reconstruct something else, to recreate a world, and hatred arises out of the fact that he doesn’t have the talent to make lines of flight.

Because if we talk about the system, it’s the Fascists that get discussed… And Pasolini, according to some his films are brilliant, but for me something’s wrong. He’s in Christ.

To another student’s query, Deleuze suggests how a becoming-animal can be caught up in a becoming-ascetic, and how different becomings may all be caught in a line that is an abstract machine. Returning to faciality, Deleuze briefly considers the gaze and subjectivity as developed, first, by Lacan, and then by Sartre, then shifts to Guattari’s previous discussion of relations between faciality and power, specifically the role and function of the face in power apparatuses. Deleuze then shifts briefly to passional power and its form of faciality, then to the topic of the maternal face, then to the celebrity face, and then proposes to consider how these different forms of faciality might pertain to apparatuses of power, all with different functions. Having established the earlier mode of faciality, Deleuze returns to contemporary faciality as a key element of power apparatuses, entailing an overcoding, sexuality being particularly overcoded by the face, but also by apparatuses of power. Student discussion briefly prevents Deleuze from continuing, but he returns to discussion of the face, notably the significance of the despot’s face as frontal face projected on a white wall, creating specific modes of signification, allowing one to fall asleep to the image. Then, a second such figure is two faces facing each other, which Deleuze relates to his previous discussion of Tristan-Isolde and plunging into the black hole (of passion). Moving beyond these, Deleuze considers a third phase, the face turning away, invented by God in the history of the Jewish people, the tale of the double turning away, and concludes with Deleuze concludes with a third image seen while falling asleep: whereas the earlier ones organized traits of faciality, the third frees up these traits which transform into other traits and even escape into landscapity.</em></p><p><strong><em>Il Senso in Meno,</em></strong> <strong>Part 3 – Faciality, Landscapity, Despotic Power</strong></p><p><strong>Translation: Graeme Thomson and Silvia Maglioni; transcription and time stamp, Charles J. Stivale</strong></p><p>[<em>Please note that the transcription follows as exactly as possible the discussion in the filmed seminar, and therefore the translation differs at time with the discussion rendered in the subtitles on the YouTube versions</em>]</p><p>Deleuze: I’d like you to reflect on this… There’s the strike today, so there aren’t many of us here. Which is good. But how should we proceed? I would suggest that, apart from what you might want to propose… either you can speak about what we’ve done so far – if you have anything to add or go back to – or else, considering that the things I wanted to talk about today are not yet clear in my mind, I can recount them in a calmer, more relaxed fashion than last time… In this way, next time, I can begin again, and everything will be clearer… [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [1:01]</p><p>Deleuze: … Anything that might spring to mind… Think well. I have an idea… I have an idea but it doesn’t work, it’s no good. It doesn’t matter…</p><p>A student: Can I ask you a question to clarify something?</p><p>Deleuze: A question to clarify? Yes. Yes. I say yes with a certain melancholy because I always find it sad. So, some questions, yes… but not many. [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [1:38]</p><p>The student: Is faciality something basic, and in a certain sense a more important point than the other two, or at a first level, are they all the same thing?</p><p>Deleuze: It depends on the level… I’m sorry if I answer you this way, but obviously it depends on the level. At a certain level everything is seized by, and refers to, faciality, while at other levels faciality comes completely undone, and it’s these levels that naturally interest us the most. But it requires a lot of effort to arrive at the levels where faciality slips away in favour of a faceless being… and then problematizes the question of the rapport between faciality and animality — in fact it problematizes a lot of things…</p><p>The student: What about the role of music?</p><p>Deleuze: Music? Yes, oh yes, oh yes. Here I plan to regroup a certain number of notions that encompass your question and that put into play somewhat a lot of what we will be covering this year because faciality comes undone as much to the advantage of what we’ve called <em>becoming-animal</em> as to that of <em>musical lines</em>. But isn’t there a rapport between becoming-animal and musical lines? As in the case of Mozart’s birds… What’s do we mean by Mozart’s birds? It doesn’t mean that Mozart makes the little birds sing. It means that his music, in a certain manner, has a rapport with birds that aren’t actually birds. So what are they? What is the relationship between becoming-music and becoming-animal?</p><p>The student: It’s the exact opposite of Wagner’s music, the moment in the forest.</p><p>Deleuze: Is it the opposite? Regarding the problem of music – it’s a good moment to speak about this now – the rapport between musical forms and things that can be defined neither as subjects nor themes but which are actual becomings… The becoming-child in music, the little refrain…</p><p>Think of an extraordinary case, a real genius, one of the greatest composers who ever lived: Schumann. His modes, his forms of musical expression are radically new, and are caught up in a series of child becomings with blocs of childhood. The story of Schumann is a good pretext for biographical-aesthetic assemblages. It’s no small matter, the becoming-animal of Schumann. When he dies, having gone mad, he has a rapport with animals that is… he hears notes only as animals. But these aren’t real animals… he doesn’t hear lions… he doesn’t hear… These are Schumann’s lions, Schumann’s hyenas… [<em>On Schumann and blocks, see</em> A Thousand Plateaus, <em>p. 298-304, and on Mozart’s birds, pp. 304-305; on Schumann and the refrain, see pp. 347-350</em>] [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [4:56]</p><p>Deleuze: While Mozart’s birds are the most spiritual birds in the world. There’s no contradiction between becoming-animal and becoming-spiritual. There’s no opposition. What’s more…</p><p>A student [<em>trying to interrupt Deleuze who just continues</em>]: … there’s a difference between becoming-spiritual and … [<em>words lost due to Deleuze speaking</em>]</p><p>Deleuze: … What’s more, at the end of ascesis, you are, you haven’t yet become, but you are within the becoming-animal. The great ascetics of Syria actually grazed…</p><p>A student: I had pointed out… [<em>words blocked as Deleuze continues</em>]</p><p>Deleuze: … in their struggle against the Church… when they said the Church is taking a wrong path, and they were hoping to return to the desert. You know how the ascetics lived on their columns, well when they came down, they grazed like cows. What we have here is a becoming-animal caught up in a becoming-ascetic, which is really fascinating, fascinating… [<em>Deleuze and Guattari briefly mention the “grazing anchorite” in a list of becomings,</em> A Thousand Plateaus, <em>p. 247</em>] [<em>Tape</em> <em>interrupted</em>] [5:52]</p><p>Deleuze: … Roughly speaking, we see how animal, spirit, man, woman, child are distinguishable as terms at the level of becomings. The becoming-animal, the becoming-spiritual, the becoming-child, the becoming-woman, the becoming-man, the becoming-woman of man, the becoming-man of woman and so on. All this is caught up in a kind of line that is an abstract machine, a sort of abstract line. But I’m saying too much, we haven’t even started yet… [<em>Tape</em> <em>interrupted</em>] [6:30]</p><p>Deleuze: Shall we proceed? Any questions on the previous topics? They’re not really precise yet so let’s try to move on a bit… [<em>Tape</em> <em>interrupted</em>] [6:41]</p><p>Deleuze: … Both in Lacan and Sartre, though in two completely different ways, the question of faces and gazes is situated – and I would add extremely actively so – in function of a certain position and a certain problem of subjectivity. I would almost say that our desire would be to do the opposite. And that should we discover processes of subjectivation, these must be in function of the face, rather than the face being related to functions of the subject. In Sartre it’s self-evident, the whole theory of the gaze is at the service of the Sartrean conception of the <em>cogito</em>.</p><p>In Lacan, if you go back to his essay on the Mirror Stage… broadly speaking I would say that the Mirror Stage seems to me to imply – and here I’m expressing myself in a very crude, rudimentary way – a kind of capture of the image which encloses it, so that in the end it is placed in relation to the so-called symbolic order, or what Lacan refers to as the symbolic order, and to a split subject in the symbolic order.</p><p>Why is it that we… when Guattari spoke the other time about faciality, are faced with a different problem? It’s because what we are mainly interested in are the relations between faciality and power and not the relations of the face and the gaze to a subject, however it might be conceived.</p><p>What do we mean by face-power relations? I will speak of the role and function of the face in power apparatuses. I’m improvising slightly but we can agree that power apparatuses are not reducible to a unified entity. Political power is the face of the leader. I don’t know if this is the case now for Georges Marchais, but at the time of Thorez, when Thorez arrived at a party meeting  people would say, “Ah, here’s Maurice!” The first name is indicative of a face. “Look, it’s Maurice, hello Maurice!” So political power is the face of the boss.</p><p>And suddenly it’s no longer only the first name. There’s the whole role of the poster, the portrait. The portrait has its own history: painting. And painting is complicit with power apparatuses, even if it is so in its own way, as for example in the case of Goya or Velasquez… [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [10:22]</p><p>Deleuze: … One of the functions of painting itself is to establish the official portrait. The portrait of the king, the portrait of the leader… or today it’s photography. Can we get shut of all this, by saying that they are simply ideological phenomena? Perhaps we will have the chance to see how bad a concept ideology is, not because it defines phenomena of illusion but because the concept of ideology itself is a completely false one. Ideology doesn’t exist. What exist are components in power organizations.  Thus, the face of the leader, political faciality, is perhaps a component of the political power apparatus.</p><p>Second example, I continue… passional power. If there is a political power, there is equally a power of the passions. It’s a classic theme. Passional power and the face of the beloved. When did this happen? It’s not a simple matter… It occurred when the face of the beloved took on the appearance of a piece in a power apparatus. The passion-power. When did this occur? Broadly speaking – perhaps there are precedents – this happens during the time of courtly love. It’s then that the face of the beloved takes on a role – it begins around the 11th-13th century – that compared with previous epochs really seems like a bout of madness. We can say that something new made its appearance. So, this is my second example: passional power – and with it a second form of faciality: the face of the beloved… [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [12:44]</p><p>Then there is a topic that has become a commonplace of psychology, of neonatal psychology, which is the baby’s reaction to the mother’s face. It’s interesting… they don’t talk about the reaction to the gaze, it’s always the question of the maternal face. The baby that is being breastfed reacts to mummy’s face. The power of family is the mother’s face. So, there we have a third form, or a third case, of faciality. One expert on this question is a paediatrist and psychoanalyst called Spitz. S-P-I-T-Z. He has shown the importance of a certain illness that he regards as quintessential in the development of a number of schizophrenic phenomena in children. The baby, when deprived of the mother’s face, reacts through a strange malady characterized by schizoid disorders.</p><p>Then we have the face of the “star”. The star’s face is interesting. For the next time – seeing as how there aren’t many of you at today’s class and we’re limiting ourselves to sketching out some new topics… The star’s face… we’d need someone familiar with the history of cinema to do some research on this topic which must be really interesting… What role did the star’s face play in silent cinema? And with the advent of the talkies, did anything change in the function of faciality at the level of the star’s face? Did the voice really have the role that’s been attributed to it at the beginning of the talkies? It certainly did have a role but not the one you might think. When the talkies began, did the individuation of the star occur through voice or not?</p><p>A student: There are examples of stars who made the transition from silent to sound cinema…</p><p>Deleuze: Yes, although there aren’t many for whom it worked. But I’m thinking more of the question: silent star, sound star. Does the faciality function work in the same way?… [<em>Tape</em> <em>interrupted</em>] [15:52]</p><p>Yolande Finkelstein: All of discourse, the whole of literature is situated in relation to the desire of the other. And the other’s desire means the other’s gaze. Which means that suddenly the only things that can exist do so through the other’s gaze. And what I wanted to talk about in the last lesson in relation to a certain type of spectacle… I suddenly have the impression that, in the same way that money circulates, so too do gazes. I mean… at the level of merchandise, how desire is imprinted… and besides… you were talking about the boss’s face… well, I want to speak about woman’s face. Because woman’s face doesn’t exist either, and…</p><p>Deleuze: Sorry, I did make an allusion to courtly love and the face of the beloved.</p><p>Yolande Finkelstein: Yes, ok, but I mean even woman, even speaking about ‘woman’ in general. I mean, in the spectacle there is always a certain division of roles, of functions. And seeing as how the other day we were speaking about the semiotic wall, to be honest now I’d like to speak about doors. I mean… there’s always a kind of unfolding of events that takes the form of a trial, and therefore you have a whole category of illusory doors. And… well, anyway, that’s it.</p><p>Deleuze: Yes? Yes? What you are calling, perhaps it is relatively close, if these are illusory doors, they are perhaps quite close to what Félix was calling <em>black holes</em>. There could be a connection there. But we’ll see. But I think that goes entirely in the direction of… – [<em>An abrupt sound of movement</em>] Don’t fall down! – That goes entirely in the direction of… [<em>Deleuze does not finish the sentence</em>]</p><p>Yes, so let’s suppose that these functions of faciality, these facialities pertain to apparatuses of power, and are distributed throughout them with different functions. And maybe even through different figures. Let’s chance a small verbal link with some previous matters. Wouldn’t the face be one of their key forms? But of what, you may ask. One of the key forms of redundancy… or, better, isn’t the face a knot of arborescence? And to enter into rhizomes, don’t we have to undo the face? And what would it mean, “to undo the face”? Well, it’s just a question, a point of reference that will maybe help us locate things… but let’s be more precise.</p><p>Let’s suppose that power needs, or rather powers need – each in their own way – to produce face. There is a production of face. In the story of how Hitler… and here Félix was right in speaking in general about micropolitics… when we think of the story of how Hitler came to power: why should it be Hitler and not the high command who was ready to seize power? Why Hitler? What took place at the micropolitical level? There were traits of faciality that provoked redundancy, a resonance that had political and economic dimensions. This is why we’re well beyond simple ideology. What was it that made Hitler’s face literally rewarding, not illusory, not ideological, but profitable and rewarding? There is an economy of faciality.</p><p>Let’s try to formulate this… For the moment all we have is a rough schema, I’m not saying we have an answer. But let’s try to advance with this topic. Where does the link between power and faciality derive from? Once again, we can’t say that faciality is at the source of power. That would be a nonsense, to ascribe everything to psychology or I don’t know what. Faciality has its place, as a component piece of power apparatuses.</p><p>So then, where does the link derive from? For sure, there is no genetic link. Again, we cannot say that power derives from a face that imposes itself. That’s not it. So where does this intimate rapport faciality-power apparatus originate? We can conceive of systems where it doesn’t feature. Let’s imagine… let’s proceed by an imaginative experiment, which is the best way because it’s always there that we can vary things. There are different semiotics, the face is obviously part of a type of semiotics. The face, faciality, is a semiotics of power or it forms part of certain semiotics of power.</p><p>But there are other semiotics that don’t function through faciality. The mask… the mask is a very complicated notion. We have to think about masks the way Levi-Strauss considered totemism, which is to say that the mask as such is a false concept. Masks have such a multiplicity of functions that speaking about <em>the</em> mask doesn’t mean anything. But there are cases where the mask, rather than constituting a phenomenon of faciality, constitutes a phenomenon whose role is to make the head into an actual function of the body – which is to say, its role is to avert all risk of an autonomous faciality. This helps us advance a little…</p><p>In other semiotics of power, in other systems, there needs to be autonomy of faciality but to whose benefit, and for what? Sorry, we’re going too fast here… Every time a semiotics of power will have the tendency to deny or suppress references of corporeality, coordinates of corporeality, it will at the same time tend to replace the semiotics of corporeality with a semiotics of a wholly different nature: that of faciality.</p><p>Let’s take the example of what we could call, just to be simple, primitive peoples… or rather – to use a more useful word that will help us lose the evolutionist baggage – we can even talk about <em>pre-signifying semiotics</em>, primitive semiotics. [<em>On this point, see in</em> A Thousand Plateaus <em>the two plateaus, on signifying regimes and on faciality</em>] What goes on in primitive semiotics? All the components are interwoven in such a way that they never find themselves dominated by a signifier. That’s why we can refer to them as pre-signifying – semiotics that aren’t distributed in line with signifying chains, but which refer simultaneously to gestural, rhythmic and oral components – which doesn’t mean components of the face… by oral components I mean the mouth as a cavity, and that has nothing to do with the face.</p><p>If I seek to characterize these pre-signifying components, to attribute certain features to them, I would say: corporeality – including in their power apparatuses… So, corporeality, animality, an intimate rapport with animal-becomings, collective enunciation, a collective mode of enunciating… At the same time these semiotics are heavily territorialized, these power apparatuses are heavily territorialized. So, to sum up pell-mell: corporeality, animality, collectivity, territorialization… [<em>Tape</em> <em>interrupted</em>] [25:43]</p><p>Deleuze: … We reterritorialize on the face, the face of the leader. “Hi Maurice, Maurice, you’re here!” “Hello Georges!” And Maurice, having nothing more to say, replies “Good morning comrade.” And there are murmurs of “Here’s the boss!” “Did you see? It’s the boss.” Then you have the face of the star. It’s Greta Garbo… “Hello Greta Garbo!” We’re light years away from questions of the gaze, with her dark glasses, the black holes of Greta Garbo. So, we have Greta Garbo. And then, “Oh, it’s mummy!”</p><p>So, anyway, this is our hypothesis. Unlike what occurs in semiotics of corporeality, or in corporeal power apparatuses of the primitive, pre-signifying type, faciality becomes, or would become – other than this we can’t say anything yet, we don’t know why… But faciality would perhaps become – it’s just a hypothesis – a key element of power apparatuses, when power apparatuses become disembodied, abstract, when they are deterritorialized, and therefore what happens is a reterritorialization on the face. What would this hypothesis mean? Maybe we’ll realize it’s false, but I’d be surprised… it’s not possible. We’ll realize that it is true but for reasons we don’t yet know. It’s clearly true; it cannot be false.</p><p>So where does this lead us? It leads us to say something quite simple, which is… when primitive codes break down, when they collapse, when pre-signifying codes – with their polyvocality, their mixture of gestural, rhythmic, corporeal, animal, territorialized components – when this collapse occurs… in brief, when the savages disappear to the profit of the great empires or whatever, you name it… feudality, certain forms of feudality — African, Asian — and later capitalism and so on… what happens is that sexuality, or even phenomena of  desire in general, undergo (if we want to continue with this terminology) a vast <em>decoding</em>. They are literally <em>decoded</em>. Their codes lay in pre-signifying semiotics. Women, the collective character of marriages, children… it was all in place, well framed. Obviously, there was a decoding of desire, of sexuality, women, children. Decoded flows of women, children. Our hypothesis consists simply in saying: faciality is what rises up as a means of <em>overcoding</em>. It’s not by chance that the face, unless it’s swollen, right, unless it’s swollen, is the least sexualized component of the body. And is the face part of the body? Yes, no… we don’t know… we shall see.</p><p>In any case, when primitive codes collapse, when desire undergoes this trial of decoding, it becomes overcoded by the face, which therefore takes on a function that is not at all that of sublimation – it won’t be directly sexual – but which will nonetheless form a part, an integral part, of sexuality. On a formal plane, the face will become the overcoding of sexuality. It becomes our way of overcoding sexuality, in line with the will and the directives of incorporeal, deterritorialized apparatuses of power and so on… It’s the face, the eyes of your beloved, your leader’s gaze. All these faces… the face of a star…</p><p>Georges Comtesse: The eyes of Elsa… [<em>Reference to a collection of poems (1942) by Louis Aragon, as well as the name of his wife</em>]</p><p>Deleuze: The eyes of Elsa. Yes.  The eyes of Elsa…</p><p>Yolande Finkelstein: Even if…</p><p>Deleuze [<em>responding to an inaudible comment</em>]: It’s not the same? It’s even another case? Fine… [<em>Inaudible response</em>] You’d better not mess around with the eyes of Elsa!</p><p>A student: But he messed with them!</p><p>Yolande Finkelstein: But even if we take all these examples…</p><p>Deleuze: And what happened then? What happened?</p><p>Yolande Finkelstein: But even if we take all these examples… there’s something I want to say… The other day, after the little accident, I heard someone say, well yes, but the guy who got into that fight, he spent the whole night with the woman he was with, next to whom he was standing…</p><p>Deleuze: Great. That means it was a good subject. It’s clear that all these problems concern us, problems of the couple, of faciality, these concern us. Except for those holy spirits who have set off on a becoming-animal that consists in grazing. But I am the only one here…  actually, I shouldn’t have said that… Okay, so this is our first hypothesis. Is it clear to everyone? There aren’t any… [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [33:03]</p><p>A student: … I was very uneasy at the beginning, when you started talking about power. I would prefer if we just continued what we were doing… and when the subject came up, we could discuss it directly… but not to begin with it, because, I don’t know, the concept of power in this lesson has become too structured, so it’s… anyway…</p><p>Deleuze: Just now, you mean?</p><p>The student: Yes, now we were speaking…</p><p>Deleuze: So, we’ll stop.</p><p>The student: I hope so, but…</p><p>Deleuze: Oh, we can’t talk about Proust all the time! [<em>Laughter</em>] And when we do talk about Proust, we’re discussing [<em>unclear words</em>] …</p><p>The student: But I have the impression that this matter… before the symbolic structuring Lacan speaks of, for example, you have aspects that connect to musculature, parasitism, the rapport with the mother… something that also reminds me a bit of a text by Marx on what a number of economists including Rousseau were saying about the state of humanity before capitalist society. I mean, what Marx calls the <em>Robinsonades</em>. When we speak about rhizomes or non-faciality or making faciality collapse, aren’t we perhaps falling into an idealist, even ideological discourse? And wanting to unmask something, falling into another schematization?</p><p>Deleuze: You’re bringing up a lot of different questions here. Obviously, I am wary of any confrontation with psychoanalytical topics such as narcissism, pre-narcissism, Lacan’s topics in “The Mirror Stage”… I’m wary of them simply because they are none of our business. There’s room for a lot of kinds of business in the heavenly kingdom! Maybe we’ll come across what you’re saying. We’ll encounter it, but indirectly. I don’t know. Perhaps.</p><p>When you say that it’s unnecessary to focus all our attention on power, grant me that we’ve only been discussing this for fifteen or twenty minutes, based on a single question. If you agree and no one has anything further to add, we’ll go back to this question, alas, we’ll go back to it because we need to; for Félix and I, it’s necessary. We’re trying to settle the issue, and it extends from the power of the star to that of Hitler, so it’s sufficiently varied, it’s quite varied — not to mention Odette’s power over Swann – the question is extremely varied. But for the moment we’re blocked. However we’ve established one thing, a hypothesis that I’ve tried to summarize… Yes?</p><p>Anne Querrien: The first congregation of teachers that was deterritorialized and that attained a national scale was that of Jean Baptiste de La Salle. Curiously enough <em>The Rules of Christian Decorum and Civility</em>, which teaches correct comportment, and was written by de La Salle… millions of copies of which were distributed in France… is the first to say something positive about the face.</p><p>Deleuze: Interesting… What date is that?</p><p>Anne Querrien: The first edition is from 1713… and in the previous <em>Rules</em> – which is closer to de La Salle in terms of content – the only mention of the face is this: “Since it is upon the face that signs of the spirit of wisdom and modesty especially appear, which cause one to be well or favourably judged, we must ensure that it is always well composed” … [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [37:15]</p><p>AQ: … “To be agreeable to others, do not assume a stern or a forbidding countenance…”</p><p>Deleuze: You all hear that, right? [<em>Laughter</em>]</p><p>AQ: “It should not be stern or forbidding but nor should it show anything too giddy or resembling a schoolboy. The whole face ought to reflect an air of seriousness and wisdom. Nor is it according to decorum to have a melancholy or a peevish countenance, and your face ought never to reflect any passion or ill-regulated affection. Your face ought to be happy with no sign of…”</p><p>Deleuze: I interrupt you, Anne, just to stress one of Félix’s concepts – which is the enumeration of traits of faciality and their associated norms with respect to a model-face.</p><p>Anne Querrien: And it continues… “with no sign of either intemperance or dissipation. It ought to be serene but not too easygoing; open, without giving signs of too great a familiarity; gentle, without softness, and never suggesting anything vulgar. To everyone it must manifest your respect or, at the least, your affection and goodwill. It is, however, proper to allow the expression on your face to reflect the various business matters and circumstances that arise.”</p><p>And then he goes on to explain that on a sad occasion, one must not obviously appear cheerful [<em>Laugther</em>] The wise man seeks to “maintain a tranquil countenance that does not readily change its disposition or expression, no matter what happens, agreeable or disagreeable… It is something very improper, something that shows great vanity and is not at all becoming in a Christian, to apply beauty spots and paint to your face, covering it with powder and rouge. The vain person who resorts to such artifices performs an unnatural gesture since nature is our reference.”</p><p>Deleuze: Obviously classical, not romantic nature…</p><p>Anne Querrien: Yes, classical. It also says that one shouldn’t frown as a furrowed brow expresses melancholy. [<em>Laughter]</em> “It is impolite to knit your eyebrows; this is a sign of haughtiness. Instead, you ought to keep your brows relaxed all the time… To raise them indicates scorn, and to let them droop over the eyes is characteristic of the melancholy person”. The part about the eyes is also very interesting. The rules of modesty insist that the eyes should be soft, serene, demure, etc.</p><p>What I find fascinating is that all this is contained in <em>The Rules of Christian Decorum and Civility</em> which was distributed to the entire population and then taken up by teachers… “Modesty being the only external quality that can be controlled”, which is to say modesty is what keeps body and face as they should be. Every two months, the friars of Christian schools had to write a letter to their superior recounting everything they had done – meaning if they had been modest, well-behaved, if they had been ill, if they’d had evil thoughts and also how they’d behaved towards the children. It was a literary system created to account for one’s own behaviour by the master friars of the Christian Schools.</p><p>Deleuze: Not, literary but a programmatic system…</p><p>Anne Querrien: Yes, yes,</p><p>Deleuze: There was a program of the face, a program of faciality.</p><p>Anne Querrien: Also… with respect to landscape, to <em>landscapity</em>… the Jesuits speak about this. In ascesis, in the spiritual exercises of Saint Ignatius of Loyola, the first phase is the composition of a place: meaning that one always has to be represented in a place or landscape. There is a series of key landscapes, I have to look for the reference, because I just discovered about this… He ordered a collection of engravings, placing himself in landscapes where Christ had apparently lived. And this is how he began his spiritual exercises.</p><p>Deleuze: In the landscape?</p><p>Anne Querrien: For the Jesuits, it was in the landscape…</p><p>Deleuze: So, in the Jesuit order the exercises…</p><p>Anne Querrien: Historically speaking this is a century before…</p><p>Deleuze: … the landscapity of the Jesuits, and the faciality of the scholars who followed, who take up the Jesuits’ methods… but in order to invent something specific of their own.</p><p>Anne Querrien: More specifically for the people.</p><p>A student: What you’ve just read… in 1946, in a Catholic school in Gerson where I studied… I was fourteen… somebody read that to me. I haven’t heard it since then. And they pointed out what you just said. I mean, I was at boarding school and in our classroom, we had images of Saint Ignatius of Loyola… this was 1946.</p><p>Deleuze: Images of landscapity, landscapes. But In Loyola’s writings, as far as you know… was the landscape already presented as something that had to convey certain sentiments of the soul that could be expressed on the face, right?</p><p>Anne Querrien: On the face ? [<em>Unclear words</em>] … I haven’t researched it, so I don’t know.</p><p>Deleuze: Perhaps it only passed by way of the soul’s sentiments… Yes?</p><p>Robert Albouker: In one of his seminars, Foucault was speaking about confession during the classical age, and he spent the entire hour talking about how confession worked with the Jesuits.</p><p>Deleuze: Yes, he takes it up in <em>Discipline and Punish</em>.</p><p>Robert Albouker: Confession has to be carried out point-by-point for the whole body and especially in relation to the eyes and what one hears. Half of confession concerns the face… What did you see, what did you hear, what did you smell? You have to tell them everything.</p><p>The previous student: I want to say something else – excuse me — regarding confession that left its marks; all this reminds me of it. I was on the steps of the Gerson staircase in Rue de la Pompe, before my confession, with my confessor nearby – I had a master-confessor –, I was looking at an issue of <em>Cinémonde</em> with a photo of Martine Carol, half-naked, and that I hadn’t even had time to sneak a look at, [<em>Laughter</em>] and I was looking inside at the section on films, and my confessor came and told me: “Don’t spread [<em>diffuser</em>] that image around!” Those were his exact worlds, “Don’t spread this image around!”</p><p>Deleuze: “Don’t spread that image around!” That’s very important, and we’ll see why. Remember these words! “Don’t spread that image around!” Note them down; [<em>Laughter</em>] We’ll need that… “Don’t pass this image around!” Note it down… Ah yes, otherwise, I won’t remember it. [<em>Regarding De la Salle and Loyola, both raised in this discussion, Deleuze will indeed recall this as he and Guattari refer to both pedagogical principles in</em> A Thousand Plateaus, <em>p. 533, note 7</em>]</p><p>Anne Querrien: Concerning the landscape…</p><p>Deleuze: Yes?</p><p>Anne Querrien: I want to go back to the text…</p><p>Deleuze: It’s important this sequence: landscapity-faciality, obviously.</p><p>Anne Querrien: According to the book I read, which is unfortunately just an abridged popular edition…</p><p>Deleuze: It’s a what?</p><p>AQ: An abridged edition; it’s part of the Seuil editions, the Spiritual Masters series, I believe. In any case, the Loyola citation I mentioned says that it really aims at creating a deliberate case of redundancy. That is, it’s a question of inscribing…</p><p>Deleuze: Really, does it say that?</p><p>Anne Querrien: Yes, well, not exactly like that, if you will, but it says that it is a question of inscribing the imagination within such limits…</p><p>Deleuze: You’re a fraudster, like us! [<em>Laughter</em>]</p><p>Anne Querrien [<em>laughing as well</em>]: More or less… [<em>Pause</em>] It’s a question of inscribing the imagination within strict limits, in such a way that it becomes completely fixated on the desired object, thereby yielding something similar.</p><p>Deleuze: It is redundancy, redundancy of frequency because I’m sure they carried it out several times a day. That works for us, perfect, perfect… [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [44:20]</p><p>Deleuze: Yes, did you want to say something?</p><p>Yolande Finkelstein: Yes because, a while ago, people thought about setting Jacques Martin straight because he hosts a TV show every Sunday morning called “Le petit rapporteur”… and every week his aim is to demolish a figure on the left. And his main argument is “Did you see that guy’s face?” Really…</p><p>Deleuze: Yeh, yeh…</p><p>YF: “Did you see that guy’s face?”</p><p>A woman student: [<em>Inaudible remarks, but apparently regarding actions by Sartre</em>]</p><p>Deleuze: Unfortunately, Martin did something like that, but we have to forgive Sartre everything. [<em>Laughter</em>] I think he explained himself later. He said he had been rushed; he’d spoken too quickly. At least I think that Sartre said something like that. [<em>Pause</em>]</p><p>So… ok fine. We’re done with this first point. I’ll pass on now to a second point that at first glance seems completely different… I haven’t forgotten, Antoine, we can talk later if you don’t mind… [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [45:32]</p><p>Deleuze: … I would just like to have the right to dream a little, with Félix and all of you. I say the words, “There it is, I see!” And it’s as if – and it’s not by chance that I’m saying this, because it’ll be useful later – it’s as if we pretended to fall asleep. As if we were in the <em>phase</em> of falling asleep, as psychologists say. And then we start to see strange things.</p><p>The first thing I see, and I really do see it, I’m seeing it… is the face of the despot. The despot’s face is highly significant. I would even say that in this first figure we have the very substance of the signifier. He has knitted his eyebrows; he has a hidden smile. The despot’s face as signifier, you can find texts everywhere, on all the despots, where they talk about their facial tics, they had their… [<em>Deleuze does not complete the sentence</em>] [<em>On the despotic face as signifier, see</em> A Thousand Plateaus, <em>plateau 5 on regimes of signs, notably pp. 130-137, and plateau 7 on faciality, notably pp. 180-184</em>]</p><p>This face of the despot… allows me to dream, maybe I’m mistaken, we don’t know yet. It’s a face that imposes itself upon us, at least when we are falling asleep, and it’s always facing me. A frontal face. You could say to me “And what about yours?”  Well, I don’t have that. I tend to be bowed over, though I obviously look at that face, sometimes bowed over, sometimes with my eyes raised. It’s a face on high. Facing me.</p><p>So why this face? There must be a reason. Because for all of us… it doesn’t matter if you realize it or not, you’ll always see it as you’re falling asleep… Why is this face, facing us, projected on a white wall? As though the wall had windows. It’s similar to the techniques of graffiti. A man facing us on a white wall, on a white background. The white wall and the signifying face seen frontally. Like the face on the Shroud. The face imprinted on a handkerchief. This face facing us on a white wall seems to me something terrifying, something terrifying. While we’re in peaceful conditions for falling asleep, it’s terrifying. Maybe it doesn’t exist, maybe it does, maybe…</p><p>Anyway, there’s a first point, let’s put it aside for the moment. It already forms a schema. A white rectangle, a face. Is this face already a black hole? A black hole on a white wall, that would suit us. But let’s not rush things. Let’s just say: a face on a white wall. And that’s the face signed and frontal. That’s the signifying despotic face. In fact, it doesn’t act by means of the signified. It acts through a series of rhythmic lines on a white wall. What it means, which is to say what it signifies… is of no importance. Whatever it signifies, it will always signify something, and this something will never be any use to us. It’s pointless to concern ourselves with it.</p><p>Second figure… I’ve already developed this sufficiently so I can just remind you of it. Two faces facing each other… that approach one another as they descend. The first figure was, as we would say today in specialist language, synchronic. It’s synchronic: face on white wall. The second figure: two faces facing one another that move closer, following a line. As I said, I’ve already developed this at length, so I’m not going to insist: Tristan-Isolde, Tristan-Isolde, Tristan-Isolde up to an exaggerated proximity of the two faces – which means what? The plunge into the black hole.</p><p>This figure is diachronic. There’s a whole becoming of the two faces, which are not necessarily facing each other.  They might even be back-to-back. In any case, they are in profile, two faces in profile that descend, approach one another, brush against a black hole… faces that will plummet into a black hole, the black hole of passion. Tristan and Isolde. This time it’s no longer the signifying synchronic face of the despot on the white wall. It’s the passional face. Or, to stick to a convenient term, one without the slightest hint of evolutionism, it’s the “post-signifying” face. The passional face of the beloved, not with the function of <em>signifiance</em>, but with one that we could call the function of <em>subjectivation</em>.</p><p>But you see, following our method, this doesn’t mean that we refer the face to a subject but, rather, it is from a figure of the face that we generate the function of subjectivation. And when I refer to the two profiles that don’t necessarily face one another, in this diachrony, in this falling towards the black hole, this time, what we have is no longer a face seen frontally on a white wall but a face in profile that flows along a diachronic line, a diachronic line, in opposition to the surface of the white wall, that moves towards the black hole.</p><p>But not necessarily; I’m saying they are not necessarily looking at one another, as I said before. They might half turn to observe each other. You see, from passional love they’re already tending towards a kind of conjugal phase. They observe each other. Or else they turn away. God turns away from my face as I turn away from his. There was a time that gods didn’t turn their faces away. Which god invented the turning away of the face? Who was the god that turned his face away from his devotee, just as the devotee turned his face away from his god? Who invented this diachronic line that heads towards a black hole? It’s the history of the Jewish people, the story of the double turning away. A history that will have its own unfolding and that will end with the antisemite Heidegger… in his reinterpretation of the double turning away, that he calls categorical, and it’s not by chance that all this comes from Kant, passing by way of Hölderlin.</p><p>This falling asleep is opening up a lot of material, it’s becoming too erudite, so I’ll stop there, but it’s clear that here we have another figure… [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [55:00]</p><p>Deleuze: … You can see that our strongest desire is to make the black holes and the white walls function together. Because they have to. And this is where terror is born. A black hole in a white wall, there’s nothing more terrifying. Any other kind of death would be preferable to that.</p><p>Okay, so here’s the third image we see while falling asleep. The previous ones were modes of organizing the traits of faciality. And as Anne quite rightly said, there is a list of traits of faciality that will be overcoded by the face.</p><p>The third figure of falling asleep that I see… and here things start to get more disturbing… what happens is a kind of freeing up of the traits of faciality that escape the face, as though the face melted and the traits of faciality became like birds, sometimes heavy, sometimes light… and began to interact with other traits, traits of landscapity… “Hair in the wind”, as Félix calls it. [<em>End of recording</em>] [56:33]</p><hr><a href=#lecture-5-the-novel-and-courtly-romance><h1 id=lecture-5-the-novel-and-courtly-romance><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Lecture 5: The Novel and Courtly Romance</h1></a><blockquote><p>In courtly love, there is a whole overcoding that happens through the face in reaction to conjugal relationships. So we have this theme. And there’s also the theme of the two faces. Perceval thinks of the face of Blanchefleur. Perceval-Blanchefleur. Perceval-Blanchefleur. So we have this kind of passional faciality. There’s the white wall – the snow with the three drops of blood on it – the black hole, which is both the falcon that attacks the geese and the catatonia, the black hole of passional catatonia into which Perceval falls. And, lastly, there is a system of decomposition where traits of landscapity, traits of faciality, the exit from the black hole – all this becomes mixed to form a very curious thing. And we shouldn’t be surprised, because if we take this complex – in the sense of an ensemble – if we take our complex: white wall, face, white line, black hole, face inscribed on the white wall flowing towards the black hole… If we take all this together, we can say that each of the various elements pertains to very different semiotics, very different systems of signs, yet at the same time the whole forms a mixed semiotics.</p></blockquote><p><em>This very brief recording continues the previous session’s discussion of white wall and black holes, with Deleuze pursuing a rhizomatic method of starting a novel from the middle (the Kafka or ant method), contrasting this to the habit of beginning at the end, for example, with the chivalric novel where a character is deterritorialized and wanders, a line of the novel that Deleuze see running from Chrétien de Troyes to Beckett. Examining the novel of courtly love, linking this line to Dostoyevsky, Kafka as well as Beckett, Deleuze contrasts this errant line to the epic or dramatic tale of a hero. Deleuze then proposes “proof” of his argument with a facial representation (in a book he circulates) of a demon face from Ethiopia, with black holes for eyes, of the Negus, with faciality understood at once a the substance of the signifier and as the attribute of subjectivity. In contrast to these examples, Deleuze proposes Henry Miller’s works as an attempt to break through the wall through a becoming-masochist and becoming-animal, and after an intervention by Georges Comtesse on courtly love, Guattari intervenes, in some ways to respond to Comtesse, to discuss the contrast between deterritorializing movement provoked by the semiotic collapse with relation to the face and the need to reconstitute artificial points of reterritorialization (faces, couple relations, identities, among others). Guattari suggests that in order to pass these semiotics through the worst despotism of territorialized systems, a tabula rasa is necessary of all the old territorialized semiotic components which will be swept into a new system of semiotic power that functions through informational overcoding. A recording interruption leads to Deleuze speaking very briefly of Kleist and the programmed life, and then taking one student’s comments as the session abruptly ends.</em></p><p><strong>The Novel and Courtly Romance, the White Wall Black Hole of Passional Faciality, Demonism of the Negus, Art Brut, Henry Miller, Quanta of Information and Quanta of Possibilities</strong></p><p><strong>Translated by Graeme Thomson and Silvia Maglioni</strong></p><p>Deleuze: … We had to find a way to break through the white wall or – which amounts to the same thing – to get out of the black hole. It’s not easy knowing how to get out of the black hole or how to break through the white wall. So here is a second grouping, not even of notions in this case but of dreams, of fallings asleep.</p><p>And to conclude this second part, before I let you speak and tell me what you think, I would just like to say… There’s a strange story, a text that I think is wonderful. Here I open a parenthesis, but one that is inherent to the second notion. I number them so things will be clearer when we go back to them. </p><p>I know I seem to be going off the subject, but when people speak about the novel, or the history of the novel, there’s something that isn’t right. Because we’re so horrified by origins, by the return to origins, we’ve got into the habit of beginning from the end. Initially, this was a good thing, when the method worked, but then… We employ the <em>rhizomatic method</em>, which is different, we examine things from the middle. That way, we’re at no risk of making a mistake. This is the Kafka method, or the ant method. The <em>rhizome method</em>. An ant seizes things from the middle. We are ants.</p><p>I was talking about the novel and how we had the habit of beginning from the end. We discover, for example, and here I make a concrete example… we experience the end of the novel, or we have experienced it, through a catastrophic text like Camus’s <em>The Stranger.</em> Or other marvellous novels, like those of Beckett that mark its limit point. The novel is over. Or else we’re told… that in a certain epoch there was the chivalric novel. And then that came to an end with the famous <em>Don Quixote. Don Quixote</em> marked the end of the romances of Chivalry because it’s the moment when there is no longer any sense in the figure of the knight, and he can only be embodied by someone like Don Quixote who is completely mad, mistaking windmills for who knows what and so on… It’s a well-known story. <em>Don Quixote</em> is considered the end of the chivalric novel. [<em>On the chivalric novel in this context, see</em> A Thousand Plateaus_, pp. 173-174_]</p><p>A student: The horse is no longer a horse.</p><p>Deleuze: What?</p><p>The student: Above all, the horse is no longer just a horse.</p><p>Deleuze: Yes, yes, yes. Yes, it becomes more important. And these endings, to what do we attribute them? They are attributed when, and here again I roughly sum up, we are shown the hero to be a poor guy who is completely lost. What I’m saying is: of course there is an evolution of the novel – I’m not saying the novel has always remained the same – but if there is such an evolution then this is certainly not what it focuses on. Because the appearance of a character who is completely… I can’t think of a better term… completely <em>lost</em>, who doesn’t know what he’s doing, who doesn’t know his own name even, who is a stranger to everything, who is completely deterritorialized, who wanders along his line of flight understanding nothing, who stops, and when he’s not on his line of flight becomes completely catatonic, you see here what psychiatry defines as catatonic, a person who remains for hours on end in a movement that can be quite intricate, involving all the muscles, and who spends maybe 6 hours, 24 hours in this state. So then…</p><p>A student: Are many of these people around?</p><p>Deleuze: Not many of them are around, unfortunately, because the psychiatric hospitals were demolished, but at the time when there were psychiatric hospitals, you could see a lot of them about. You could see a lot of them! [<em>Laughter, unclear for what reason</em>] Whereas now, you see people lying on couches, [<em>Laughter</em>] in comparison, the catatonics were much more active. So anyway…</p><p>The student: But some of the shrinks fucking their patients!</p><p>Deleuze: Catatonics?</p><p>The student: No.</p><p>Deleuze: Ah… the others! It’s possible. Though the idea disturbs me… So, I was saying. This was the inauguration of the novel. This is it. If I have to define the novel, I’d say that it appears at the moment a certain type of character emerges. And if someone said to me, “but your definition of the novel is based on characters, that’s not the way to proceed, it’s the signifier that counts”, that just makes me laugh. The novel appears with a certain type of character who has no idea of his own name, of what he is doing, who is a complete idiot, utterly lost, completely just standing there and looking. And what is he looking at? He doesn’t even know. Someone comes up and taps him on the shoulder.</p><p>I’d say that the real Albert Camus is Chrétien de Troyes. He’s the first great novelist. And the line runs from Chrétien de Troyes to Beckett who, it should be said, knows the Middle Ages well, all the Celtic novels and the romances of courtly love. And what do we find when we open a courtly romance? A romance of the courtly love cycles, or of Chrétien de Troyes. I’m not even going to read a passage because it would be too long, and you can find them in paperback editions. If you haven’t read them, buy them. They are wonderful.</p><p>For example, you’ll find a knight, who’s just there sitting on his horse. In the distance is a peasant who says: “Look, do you see him? A knight asleep on his horse!” But for him this is nothing exceptional. In fact, that’s how he recognizes it’s a knight. “It’s a knight, do you see him?” He’s leaning on his lance like this. And he’s fast asleep. He sleeps on. And then another knight comes along. They have brief waking periods… [<em>Laughter</em>] He arrives on his errant line, his line of deterritorialization. Or else, the knight who has fallen into a catatonic state and is asleep finds himself in the territory of another knight, who suddenly awakens. And the awakened knight says: “Don’t move!” There’s no danger of him moving in his state. “Don’t move! You hear me?” The other knight hears nothing. There’s a second and then a third call. The three summations of chivalry… On the third call, the conscious knight says: “You have gravely offended me. You don’t answer me.” And he whacks him over the head with his lance or with his broadsword. The other is astonished, the sleeping, catatonic knight wakes up. “Hey what’s this? You hit me!” </p><p>For those who don’t believe me, I’ll just read you a short extract: “You hit me!” “Three times I addressed you and you made no answer!” “Had you spoken to me, I would have heard you. I didn’t hear anything” “Too bad. You offended me in any case. We must fight!” “Why must we fight?” “I’ve no idea…”</p><p>The search for the Holy Grail is wonderful: they don’t know what they are looking for. They don’t know their own names. They pass the time forgetting their name. Molly is nothing in comparison to Lancelot. He’s really incredible. In one of Chrétien de Troyes’s finest romances, there’s a knight who sees a cart… The story is called “Knight of the Cart.” He looks at it and gets onto it. He doesn’t have any reason for doing so.</p><p>It’s like, many centuries later, Dostoyevsky with his great characters who go out onto the street with a precise objective. They say: “I have to go and see Ivanovich, there’s no time to waste.” Then, when they go out, they suddenly wonder: “What was it I had to do again?” And they set off in the opposite direction. Here again we have faces turning away from one another. A curious game of faciality and landscapity. They no longer know.  Or else… Kafka. K wants to go to the Palace of Justice and gives the address of the bank, or maybe it’s the other way round, I don’t remember… He goes in the other direction. Bizarre things happen.</p><p>But in the case of the Knights who forget even their name and are completely catatonic… Seeing as you are correct in not believing me… [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [10:50]</p><p>Here is a lovely phrase: “The Knight of the Cart is occupied with deep reflections, like one who has no strength or defence against love which holds him in its sway.” You see, it happens very quickly. This is connected to the face of the beloved. “He totally forgets himself, and he knows not whether he is alive or dead, forgetting even his own name, not knowing whether he is armed or not, or whither he is going or whence he came. Only one creature he has in mind and for her…” — which is to say his beloved’s face — “his thought is so occupied that he neither sees or hears aught else. His horse takes him on tortuous paths” and so on. The Knight on guard arrives and he says: “Don’t move!” etc. Three times. And the knight of the cart, who is called Lancelot – it’s the romance of Lancelot – gets whacked on the head. He’s furious, they fight… no it’s not that passage. [<em>Laughter; Deleuze looks through his text</em>] I had noted it down, thinking I would need some evidence… P.153… No, I haven’t underlined it… It’s p.112-113. Maybe… 112-113. No, it’s not that either. Okay, so as I just demonstrated, you won’t have any proof. You’re not going to get it.</p><p>Here then is the passage that I would like to read in its entirety because it’s so beautiful and moreover short. And it seems that I’ve lost that too. In the paperback Folio edition… Chrétien de Troye. <em>Perceval, the Story of the Grail.</em> Page 111.</p><p>Perceval “saw, before he reached the tents, a flock of wild Geese, dazzled by the heavy Snow” — no need to comment here — “dazzled by the heavy Snow” — I’ll just say straight off that the snow is a white wall.  — “Did he see them? Yes, because they were fleeing as fast as birds can fly from a diving Falcon dropping out of the sky.” — The black hole of the falcon, the white wall of the snow. — “It struck at a single Goose, lagging behind the others, and hit it so hard that it fell to the earth. Perceval arrives too late without being able to [<em>unclear word</em>]. Without waiting he uses both spurs to where the Goose had fallen.”</p><p>You see his line of flight? He set off in search of the grail, he sees some wild geese, and one being struck and falling, and immediately he goes to see what has happened. An epic or dramatic hero would never do such a thing. But this is the specificity of the novel, beginning with the “poor guy”. It’s the ballad of the poor guy who doesn’t know his name, who doesn’t know… When Achilles retires to his tent, it’s a whole different story. It’s an epic. It’s not the same kind of faciality. The faciality of the novel, tragic or dramatic faciality, and epic faciality are very different things.</p><p>So, he goes to take a look. “The bird’s neck had been wounded, and three drops of blood had come rolling out on the snow, dying it vivid red. The bird had not been badly hurt, just knocked to the earth, and before the knight could reach it, it had flown away in the sky, and Perceval sees at his feet the snow where it has been resting and the still evident blood. And Perceval, leaning on his lance, contemplated the sight of the blood and snow so mixed together.”</p><p>He leans on his lance and looks. I’m saying this is landscapity. That “fresh color” – he looks at the three drops of blood on the snow, instead of carrying on with his knightly tasks. But this is precisely his task. The line of deterritorialization.</p><p>That “fresh color”, the three drops of blood on the snow were “just like his beloved’s face”, and his beloved – if I’m not mistaken – is called Blanchefleur, and she continues to abandon him because he always has something else to accomplish although he doesn’t know what it is. And you know that, historically, courtly love was established as a line of flight with respect to conjugality. It was the great movement… the great social line of flight in an active reaction to conjugality. Or should we say the reverse?</p><p>“Blood and snow so mixed together created a fresh color, just like his beloved’s face, and as he stared he forgot what he was doing and where he was. The red stain against the white snow seemed just like her complexion. Before the king awakens…” – the king too is always asleep in the novel… King Arthur is fantastic, in this sense… Again, he’s nothing like the kings of epics or the king of Shakespearean drama for example. He sleeps so deeply that a valet can pass by and knock his crown off with his elbow and he says: “You didn’t do it on purpose? Very well.” [<em>Laughter</em>]</p><p>So, “hey you over there”… [“Before the king awakens”], another guy appears, actually, several guys, “We’ve seen an knight out there, sleeping on his horse.” – “Is he bearing arms?” — “Oh yes, indeed!” — “I’ll go and talk to him… I’ll bring him to court!”, to the court of King Arthur. He has to bring back Lancelot… No, Perceval, but it won’t be an easy task, as Perceval doesn’t hear anything. He fights once again. Then they bring him before the king. And he explains, “oh, I just didn’t hear anything”, or something of the sort… [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [19:16]</p><p>… In courtly love, there is a whole overcoding that happens through the face in reaction to conjugal relationships. So, we have this theme. And there’s also the theme of the two faces. Perceval thinks of the face of Blanchefleur. Perceval-Blanchefleur. Perceval-Blanchefleur. So, we have this kind of passional faciality. There’s the white wall – the snow with the three drops of blood on it – the black hole, which is both the falcon that attacks the geese and the catatonia, the black hole of passional catatonia into which Perceval falls.</p><p>And, lastly, there is a system of decomposition where traits of landscapity, traits of faciality, the exit from the black hole – all this becomes mixed to form a very curious thing. And we shouldn’t be surprised, because if we take this complex — in the most ordinary sense of “complex”, that is, the combination of a group of things — if we take our complex: white wall, face, white line, black hole, face inscribed on the white wall flowing towards the black hole, if we take all this together, we can say that each of the various elements pertains to very different semiotics, very different systems of signs.</p><p>Yet on the other hand, the whole forms a mixed semiotics. It’s no surprise that the signifying face of the despot on the white wall already contains, already comprises, several black holes. Nor is it surprising that the passional system of black holes still contains a residue of white wall, if only in the form of the diachronic line. This melange shouldn’t surprise us. It can only be seen at the third level… of a more elaborate study. Not by chance in courtly love is the lady often referred to as the “white lady.” The white lady. Blanchefleur. The knight’s catatonia functions as a black hole, the lady as a white wall, with the vermillion of her cheeks daubed on the wall. Or, perhaps, her eyes are already black holes. Everything is mixed in a semiotics that involves all the components. And our task is to unravel it. So that’s the second remark I wanted to make… [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [22:37]</p><p>And now, to finish, before you start to speak, I want to show you a proof without saying where it comes from. Here is a face. There’s no question this is a demon, a demon from afar, from Ethiopia. The eyes are black holes. The black hole is surrounded by a coiled serpent. Each time you have a coiled serpent, you can – though it’s not obligatory, there are no rules in magic – you can place an eye in it. So, what’s the result? — The figure is a bit small, but I’ll try to show it to you. [<em>Pause</em>] I’m annoyed that I’ve lost the most beautiful of the Ethiopian demons I had. [<em>Pause ; he keeps looking, then finds it</em>] The most beautiful one is this one … [<em>Pause</em>] It’s a masterpiece. [<em>Pause</em>] Can everyone see it? [<em>Pause</em>] It’s really so beautiful. [<em>Pause</em>] You can get a better look later… I’ll pass it around.</p><p>It’s on papyrus, so it’s yellowish. White wall, black hole. But what is it? You remember the stories of Ethiopia? And here we return to the question of power. It’s true what they say. The Negus, before being deposed, had an extraordinary court of magicians and his black hole-like gaze was well-known. And the Negus had descended from a whole series, a whole lineage, beginning from Solomon in which the eyes were defined as black holes. The magic power of the black hole. And the Negus, when making his rounds of the peasant villages, relied on this magic, which is typically Ethiopian – which is why I wanted to show you this example.</p><p>There’s just one other case I can think of like this, but which is very different: certain documents published in the <em>Cahiers de l’Art Brut</em>. For example, for those of you’ve heard of an artist like [Adolf] Wölfli, who was for a long time interned in Switzerland, I believe… he made only faces composed of a circle and eyes like black holes. Or else another famous exponent of Art Brut, Aloïse [Aloïse Corbaz], who also makes black hole-eyes… Today I had too much to carry but next time I’ll bring you some of her drawings. She was also interned for a long time. In different ways the drawings of both Wölfli and Aloïse are pure black holes placed against a white background that is full of miniatures, etc.</p><p>So here is my second observation, which is a bit confused. And I repeat: “Don’t pass this image around!” Why did I want to say that? [<em>Deleuze refers here to a student’s comment in the first part of this session, under ATP I.3</em>] Because there’s an error, a risk of error in what I said. One might think that the first figure of face, which I called signifying despotic face, a single face viewed frontally, is like a unity that gathers together the different traits of faciality, while in the other figure there are at least two faces that are seen in profile, or that turn away from one another, and flow towards the black hole. At a certain level, one can say this.</p><p>But at a more rigorous and profound level, we have to admit that every face, whatever its figure, is by nature a multiplicity. It’s just that I believe the first type of face – the signifying despotic face – is a multiplicity of frequency. That’s why in the Ethiopian etchings, the Ethiopian scrolls, each time you make a circle you have the possibility of inserting an eye. The face of the despot is a multiplicity of frequency. While the face of the beloved, the passional face, is a multiplicity of resonance. That is, our two general types of faciality correspond to our two forms of redundancy, and the reason for this is simple: faciality is on one hand the substance of the signifier while, on the other, it is the attribute of subjectivity. So, it’s normal that our redundancies – the way we have distinguished them – are found precisely at the level of the face, as both substance and attribute of redundancy. Okay, so here we have a second grouping of things to investigate… [<em>Pause, then tape interrupted</em>] [28:37]</p><p>Deleuze: … There’s a wonderful example — I add this because I would like speak at least once about this author  — in Henry Miller, who has always confronted the question in these terms: Can I break through the wall? Which wall are we talking about here? Even at the level of universal history, Miller hallucinates. He’s one of the great delirious writers. There are two peoples who’ve confronted the wall. We don’t know what this wall is. He doesn’t need to tell us. American writers do better than philosophy here. He says there are two peoples: the Jews and the Chinese. What a surprise! The Jews failed at the last moment. They rebounded onto a phenomenon that was invented by Christ: subjectivity. And there are some fantastic pages on this. They bounced off the wall and fell into a black hole. The black hole of Christ and the passion of Christ. The Chinese, thanks to Buddhism – Miller says – passed through the wall, by way of a series of metamorphoses, animal becomings, musical becomings, all kinds of weird things, because you can’t break through the wall without becomings. [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [30:08]</p><p> … He throws himself into a kind of becoming masochist. And this is what happens. He bounces off the wall and falls into a black hole, which is the lesbian couple whose slave he becomes, and from then on he speaks only in barks: <em>woof woof, bow wow</em>… It’s the end of <em>Sexus</em> and the beginning of <em>Nexus</em> that are expressed through Miller’s barking. When he doesn’t manage to break through the wall, rather than becoming-animal, he becomes a little dog. So, what’s going on here? It’s all very ambiguous. Because <em>bow wow wow…</em> becoming a little dog is also a becoming-animal of sorts… We no longer understand anything… But it’s better this way, everything is mixed up. [<em>Pause</em>] Yes… [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [31:05]</p><p>Georges Comtesse: Concerning marital conjugality in the 12th century, which was extremely strong, with its virility and all the phallocratic power of past epochs towards, let’s say the “forced” bride… There was all this. And the lady constituted herself as a lady with this demand for love, making conjugality collapse by demanding a courtly lover. But also, the reverse happens because at the same time as she makes conjugality collapse, while not recomposing it, she nonetheless confirms another conjugality from which, it seems to me, we haven’t yet managed to free ourselves and which might have a role in what you were saying when you spoke about falling asleep… which is perhaps a kind of awakening after all.</p><p>What I want to say by this is that, in order to constitute herself as the lady that demands love and imposes upon the Knight, the lover, a virginal surface of voluptuousness, that of whiteness for example – Blanchefleur, who might fascinate an obsessive like Bresson – whatever you like… The lady, the so-called subjugated woman, is above all fascinated by her rebellion which at the time could only be on the sly… she’s completely fascinated – and anyone who has studied courtly love understands this – by a certain type of conjugality which perhaps still exists, the conjugality of male brotherhood. Male brotherhood, the couple formed by two men linked by a male friendship or love: this is what fascinates the courtly lady and provokes her becoming-lady or her attempts to recompose, or remake conjugality, by removing one of the partners of that couple to her own benefit… [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [33:26]</p><p>Deleuze: … Regarding the specific question of blood brotherhood and courtly love, that was the only moment when your own intervention became a bit sly, because you were invoking scholarly authority, and doing that is always a bit maladroit… because at that moment everyone senses that what you’re saying isn’t completely true. You said that all the specialists of courtly love know it, and this isn’t the case. They have animated discussions on the rapport between different customs of blood brotherhood. But we can’t take for granted what you were saying in that regard, even if the rest was very stimulating and fruitful, and we should add it to our reflections.</p><p>But I interrupted Félix for a moment [<em>This reference is probably to early in the session, in the previous segment of ATP I.3, unless some omission occurred in editing the current session</em>] and, before he begins to speak again, I just wanted to quickly read — and I’ll read this again later so you can think about it for next week – a short passage by Henry Miller, which is very apt since it contains certain words… I admit I’ve sometimes cheated a bit with citations but this time all the words are there, I don’t need to add any. I also checked the English version, which is almost identical. [<em>Deleuze reads here from Miller’s</em> Tropic of Capricorn <em>(New York: Grove Press, 1961), p. 239</em>] He’s speaking about his relationship with a woman he loved, and he says:</p><p>“She was never a being, such as might finally be caught in repose, but the mechanism itself” – that is, she was the mechanism itself — “relentlessly operating the myriad mirrors which would reflect the myth she had created. She had no poise whatsoever; she was eternally poised above her multiple identities in the vacuum of the self… In the dark, locked away in the black hole with no world looking on…” Here he’s trying to describe the black hole of love-passion, and he asks himself how he’s going to get out, without becoming the dog who goes <em>bow wow</em>.</p><p>“In the dark, locked away in the black hole with no world looking on, no adversary, no rivals, the blinding dynamism of the will slowed down a bit, gave her a molten copperish glow…” — the floating of the face — “gave her a molten copperish glow, the words coming out of her mouth like lava, her flesh clutching ravenously for a hold, a perch on something solid and substantial, something in which to reintegrate and repose for a few moments. It was like a frantic long-distance message, an S.O.S. from a sinking ship.” </p><p>And here we get to the essential: “At first I mistook it for passion, for the ecstasy produced by flesh rubbing against flesh…” — Hence, love-passion, thrown into the element of passion — “At first, I mistook it for passion, for the ecstasy produced by flesh rubbing against flesh. I thought I had found a living volcano, a female Vesuvius…” — and I don’t think there’s anything phallocratic in the following phrase — “I never thought of a human ship going down in an ocean of despair, in a Sargasso of impotence. Now…” — he says of this woman that he loved — “Now I think of that black star” — black star, black hole — “gleaming through the hole in the ceiling, that fixed star which hung above our conjugal cell, more fixed, more remote than the Absolute, and I know it was her, emptied of all that was properly herself: a dead black sun without aspect.”</p><p>That’s beautiful. It really is the path of love-passion into the black hole that it traces, passing by way of faciality. I wish I had written that. It’s beautiful. So anyway, I interrupted Félix…</p><p>Guattari: I would like to sketch out… to take up again one aspect of the problem, because I think that if it might seem like nit-picking at the moment, maybe later this will become more significant, this oscillation that you were speaking of, between the two and the three which, by the way, forms part of the dimensions of structuralist ways of thinking. The question is… wait, let me finish, otherwise we’ll never get anywhere.</p><p>Comtesse: I meant in the sense of an entanglement, not a progression…</p><p>Guattari: Listen to me… [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [39 :12]</p><p>Guattari: The deterritorializing movement provoked by the semiotic collapse that brings one to latch onto not merely the face, but even just a hole in the face, can happen because the coordinates, the “natural”, ancestral territorial references have collapsed. So, the decoded lines of society, desire’s lines of flight, throw themselves at the available hooks and holds. They race towards the abyss, towards nothing. We have to reconstitute artificial points of reterritorialization, which will be faces, couple relations, identities, roles, functions, nationalities, you name it.</p><p>This fabrication of subjectivation isn’t merely a disaster, a race towards the void that we could define in Goethe’s words as a function of the <em>demonic</em> in which different numbers follow a regressive path. It’s not merely a Romantic-style catastrophe. It is, at the same time, a positive function of the construction of a certain type of society – whether capitalist, socialist, bureaucratic, whatever…  It’s the condition for setting in motion an operation of juncture, work, fusion between semiotic systems, systems of production and social systems, which may also have a diagrammatic function different from the post-signifying regime Gilles was speaking about.</p><p>To be able to pass to these sign machines, which will function in science, production, social organization, through the worst despotism ever seen within territorialized systems, there must first be an operation of <em>tabula rasa</em>, blank page, a sweeping of the beach, the crushing of all previous semiotic features, all the old territorialized semiotic components. And once we’ve attained this kind of collapse, like the crumbling of… I don’t know, like a kind of semiotic atom bomb or else cosmic black holes that lose all their normal coordinates… what is it that happens?</p><p>In the background of this beach-sweeping operation, there will be a system of overcoding, a system of seizing power over all the old semiotic components and materials of expression. That is to say, all the old forms of organization will be swallowed up by a particular new system of semiotic power grab, which will be the instrument of all other power grabs corresponding to capitalist formations – and these will no longer function through a more or less rhizomatic co-existence of systems of semiotization (through body, space, tattoos, word, ritual, dance and so on) but through the overcoding of <em>quanta of information</em>.</p><p>These <em>quanta</em> organize, subsuming within a single formula or machine, the different quantities of formalisms that are prefabricated everywhere else – unlike all other types of organization that bring into play systems of signs which maintain openings: that is to say <em>quanta of possibility.</em> In the quanta of information, the only possibilities available are always pre-formatted. In diagrammatic systems – that is, when we break with this flattening of all the different semiotics on a single plane: the signifier – there are <em>quanta of possibility</em> that consist in passing from one stratum of coding to another. For example, we can pass from the world of the orchid to that of the wasp, from the world of energetic strata to that of semiotic strata, from one functioning of desire to another, without all of this being pre-programmed and ordered by the system… [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [43:42]</p><p>Deleuze: Kleist never ceases making programs, his programs are very peculiar. He calls them programs but we’re not sure that’s what they are… [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [43:58]</p><p>Deleuze: As workers say and feel, they are sick and tired of clocking in at 8 o’clock, 8:30 in the morning and so on… [<em>Deleuze turns toward a student</em>] And what were you saying about this preprogrammed life? Are you saying programs don’t exist, that they don’t work?</p><p>A student: They work, the workers have mistresses, or even others…</p><p>Deleuze: But having mistresses can be programmed, conjugality with a mistress can be programmed…</p><p>The student: Then they’ll do something else, that’s it! That’s it! There’s a possible opening…</p><p>Deleuze: But of course! What do you think we’re saying? Of course, there is a possible opening…</p><p>Guattari: The workers might have mistresses, but…</p><p>The student: But even if there is an opening, they immediately fall into [<em>unclear word</em>], they fall into [<em>unclear word</em>], they fall again into dialectics.</p><p>Deleuze: They do what?</p><p>The student: They fall into dialectics.</p><p>Deleuze: Why?…  [<em>End of the recording</em>] [44:53]</p><hr><a href=#lecture-6-faciality-white-screen-three-theorems-of-deterritorialization><h1 id=lecture-6-faciality-white-screen-three-theorems-of-deterritorialization><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Lecture 6:  <strong>Faciality, White Screen, Three Theorems of Deterritorialization</strong></h1></a><blockquote><p>Everyone knows the body moves. But it’s not these movements we want to talk about. What interests us are movements of a more secret nature. The body is endowed with <em>intensive movements</em>. What are these intensive movements? Even if we’ve already often used this formula – for the moment we won’t seek to justify it – compared to the animal body, the human body is animated by <em>movements of deterritorialization</em>. The human body is a deterritorialized animal body. Remember that wonderful passage in Nietzsche when for the first time the fish leaves the swamp and breathes air… Little by little, it raises itself on its hind feet.  The whole story of the human body’s arrival at vertical stature is a vast tale of deterritorialization. Let’s look at some examples, let’s not think in terms of partial-object integration but rather in terms of composition of relative movements of deterritorialization.</p></blockquote><p><em>In a brief session without Guattari, Deleuze continues to develop details regarding faciality, specifically as linked to American psychology, noting the white screen or wall of the dream, with facialization implying operations that presuppose the white wall and black holes. Rejecting different approaches to this concept (genetic, phenomenological, partial-object analysis, and structural), Deleuze focuses on bodily intensive movements, or movements of deterritorialization, considering an anatomical explanation of this concept, e.g., the hand as the agent of a movement of deterritorialization with measured speeds. The hand’s complement is the tool-object, a first-level assemblage; the mouth as a second level agent with extruding lips as deterritorialized mouth; the breast another level as deterritorialized mammary gland. Deleuze then proposes several theorems of deterritorialization, emphasizing that territoriality, deterritorialization and reterritorialization constitute three notions that are not reducible to each other. These theorems lead Deleuze to consider power apparatuses needing both face and landscape, i.e., those forces maintaining attachment to a white wall or cause a plunge into a black hole. The most deterritorialized movements on which everything artificially reterritorializes then result in overcoding whatever has lost its code, i.e., the animal body or human corporeality. These are then reterritorialized, hence overcoded, but not to be confused with so-called “primitives”, i.e. nomadic or sedentary peoples, with no need for faciality or attendant power apparatuses. This recording ends with Deleuze indicating that their abstract machines are different, e.g. dance and gesture.</em></p><p><strong><em>l Senso in Meno,</em> Part 5 – Faciality, White Screen, Three Theorems of Deterritorialization</strong></p><p><strong>Translated by Graeme Thomson and Silvia Maglioni; transcription, Charles J. Stivale</strong></p><p>[<em>Please note that the transcription follows as exactly as possible the discussion in the filmed seminar, and therefore the translation differs at time with the discussion rendered in the subtitles on the YouTube versions</em>]</p><p>There’s an article by Lewin… You can find it in this issue of <em>Nouvelle revue de psychoanalyse</em>, just after the Isakower text. [<em>See</em> A Thousand Plateaus, <em>p. 169 and p. 532 note 4; the reference is Bertram D. Lewin, “Le sommeil, la bouche et l’écran du rêve”,</em> Nouvelle revue de psychanalyse_, 5 (Spring 1972) pp. 211-224, and Otto Isakower,_ <em>“Contribution a la psychopathologie des phenomenes associes a I’endormissement, » ibid., pp. 197-210)</em>] In this article, Lewin discovers a <em>white screen of the dream</em>. We could also call it a <em>white wall of the dream</em>. The white screen of the dream, that one normally doesn’t see… Why not? According to Lewin, we don’t see the white screen of the dream because it is usually covered by the dream’s visual contents. And seeing as how Lewin is nonetheless a Freudian, just as one might predict, the dream’s visual contents express the desires – but it’s the white screen of desire – that come to trouble sleep. However, for Lewin this white screen expresses something else, not the desires that trouble sleep but the desire to sleep. This is obviously why we don’t see it. There’s only one case where we see it: when the dream lacks visual content, that is when the dream is for the most part, or else entirely, made up of vague <em>proprioceptive</em> sensations. You see how he’s trying to catch up with Isakower. The white screen of dream appears to the dreamer only when the dream is without visual content, when its only contents are those of a proprioceptive nature – manual, cutaneous and so on, as Isakower defines them.</p><p>Spitz adds the white screen. The white wall. He too being a Freudian, and always adding something to Isakower while preserving his theory, Spitz wonders what the white screen is. And he says that the white screen is again the mommy’s breast. The white wall, the white screen are mommy’s breast. It’s odd… How can the white screen be mommy’s breast? It’s not difficult, says Spitz – no, sorry… I meant to say Lewin. Spitz will have something else to say. According to Lewin, it’s when the suckling baby experiences the approach of its mother’s breast, getting larger and then pressing flat.</p><p>Bizarre, wouldn’t you say? The mother’s breast approaches the baby and, as it does so, it gets larger and flattens. And it loses its volume… I always get this wrong: concave or convex? Convex? I don’t know… you work it out! And then it forms a white screen. As you see, Lewin adds two points to Isakower’s study: a white screen appears precisely when the dream still lacks visual content. And then this white screen represents the breast that approaches and presses flat… [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [4:10]</p><p>… Spitz says that the white screen has a role that Lewin hasn’t noticed. It’s not at all the breast approaching and flattening out. That’s not what it represents. It’s the face of the mother, which the child uses as a guide to find the breast. In this way, he manages to combine Isakower’s sensation of contact with visual perception from a distance. And like many other pediatricians, he concludes that from very early on, the child uses the mother’s face as a guide. But what are the conditions of the face it sees? It sees it from the front, though blurred, a white stain on which some kind of holes are vaguely defined: the holes of the eyes. And this takes on crucial importance with regard to feeding… [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [5:26]</p><p>As long as the mouth and eyes are treated as… volumes or cavities, they are not yet… and here we need a new word: <em>facialized.</em> In more simple terms I would almost say that they still form part of the body. The facialization of the mouth and nose perhaps imply certain operations that presuppose the white wall, or the white screen, the eyes as black holes. A whole facialization that is not pre-established. So, in saying this, we must also say that there is a facialization of the breast… [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [6:32]</p><p>… The third phase of organization of the face might consist in a series of genetic stages. But this doesn’t really tell us anything. We have the impression that it isn’t like that, it isn’t true, that’s not the way it happens.</p><p>Nor do we wish to see it in terms of phenomenological positions. That’s not what happens either. It’s not like that. It’s not a confrontation of gazes, the gaze of the baby seeking the gaze of the mother. In such an approach, we hear the galloping hooves of spiritualism approaching. That’s not it. And the proof of this is that for the baby it functions even when the mother is masked. A mask with two holes. Or else, when the mask has eyes, it tries to pull at them, to tear them off like two little balls.</p><p>So, we won’t bother with phenomenological positions. We’re tired of all that. And, naturally, there’s another approach we also refuse. We absolutely do not want this to be a question of partial-object integration. And yet we feel that there is that danger; it’s … ooo, there’s danger here; the baby’s hand, the mouth, breast, eyes, the white wall to integrate them all. Why don’t we want this? Because we’re extremely distrustful regarding partial objects. We have the impression that that’s not the way our machine functions because what is this business of partial-object integration anyway? Here we see the return of the baby’s split-up body that would be integrated little by little and then… this list of objects: hand, breast, mouth, eyes… one could add others to the list. We could make a list of such objects. Fine, we’d prefer not to; no, it’s not that we don’t want to, but we’d prefer not to do this.</p><p>And, as a last point, nether do we wish to have anything to do with a structuring-structural organization. Because even in this case, imagining there is a beginning, if we consider our abstract machine without knowing what it does, knowing only that it works, that the little balls move and there is the white wall and the black hole… then we can say it works, even if we don’t know to what purpose. It’s a whole different field to that of partial objects or of structuring-structural organizations or of genetic axes and what have you.</p><p>So, what might it be for? How can be pose the problem? To gain more clarity, I’ll try to give you the answer, otherwise if I pretend to discover it, the whole thing becomes too confusing… Perhaps we can say the following: The body is endowed with movement. It shouldn’t be thought of in terms of objects but in terms of its movement. You will tell me I’m not saying anything new. Everyone knows the body moves. But it’s not these movements we want to talk about. What interests us are movements of a more secret nature. The body is endowed with <em>intensive movements</em>. [<em>Much of the discussion that follows is developed somewhat differently in plateau 3, “The Geology of Morals”, in</em> A Thousand Plateaus]</p><p>What are these intensive movements? Even if we’ve already often used this formula – for the moment we won’t seek to justify it – compared to the animal body, the human body is animated by <em>movements of deterritorialization</em>. The human body is a deterritorialized animal body. Remember that wonderful passage in Nietzsche when for the first time the fish leaves the swamp and breathes air… Little by little, it raises itself on its hind feet. The whole story of the human body’s arrival at vertical stature is a vast tale of deterritorialization.</p><p>Let’s look at some examples, let’s not think in terms of partial-object integration but rather in terms of composition of relative movements of deterritorialization. I need only go back to my list: the hand. The hand, as is well known, is a paw. It’s generally agreed that the hand is a deterritorialized forepaw, literally ripped from the ground. This at least is a fact.</p><p>What’s more, primary school textbooks distinguish between the so-called <em>musculoskeletal hand</em> – that of the monkey swinging from branch to branch – and the <em>prehensile hand</em>. And it can be said that the musculoskeletal hand represents a second degree of deterritorialization in relation to the paw, while the prehensile hand represents a third degree of deterritorialization. So, this free hand… at the same time has a correlative. Interesting… We never deterritorialize alone, but we deterritorialize at least in two.</p><p>And this, [<em>Pause, Deleuze writes something on the board</em>] this means it’s important, this matter, it is important for us. We will never treat the hand as a partial-object. That’s a butcher’s idea, to say that the hand is a partial object. It’s pure Frankenstein. Or that the eyes are partial objects. It makes no sense. It’s no good, it’s for those who chop people up into pieces, the anatomists. They’ll have quite a job making the body function through partial-object integration. It’s a disgrace. For us the hand isn’t a severed hand, it’s not a partial object but the support of a movement. Let’s try to find a better word. It’s the <em>agent</em> of a movement of deterritorialization that must literally be qualified, measured, quantified. There are speeds of deterritorialization. I said that one never deterritorializes alone.</p><p>So, what does the hand’s deterritorialization have as its complement? The tool-object, the use-object. When the hand ceases to be musculoskeletal and becomes prehensile what does it grab hold of? What it seizes, even if it happens to be a breast, is the use-object. The tool. What we will call <em>machine</em> is already this. I’m not saying it’s the machine in its totality, but it is the assemblage of the two. So that’s the first level.</p><p>Second level: the mouth. Is it a partial object? Note how I don’t yet posit a face, I haven’t posited a face. I treat the mouth as a cavity that is part of the animal body, part of what we call the muzzle or head. But it doesn’t belong to a face. It wouldn’t be good if I already gave myself a face.</p><p>So, the mouth… [<em>Pause, Deleuze points again to the drawing on the board</em>] here as well, it’s not a partial object; it’s an agent of deterritorialization. And why, and why is this? Obviously, it’s not the same as for the hand. This is why we have to compare all these movements of deterritorialization and constitute a body, not like some idiot partial object integration but – no, I erase this last remark – so not like some partial object integration, as Melanie Klein so elegantly said, but like… – no, I erase that… — the simultaneous place, the simultaneous agent of a vector and a movement of deterritorialization, with different intensities and velocities. And everything happens at once. There’s no primacy in the connections, they all link up with one another.</p><p>So why is also the mouth swept up in a movement of deterritorialization? Because – and I hope this is true since I only found it in a text written by a German professor called [Hermann] Klaatch [<em>See</em> A Thousand Plateaus, <em>p. 533, note 6</em>] – who says something quite splendid. He studied to be a vet and he says: Humans, not even hominids, but only humans have lips. What a revelation! Only humans have lips. Even if some humans don’t, but this concerns faciality. What does this mean that only humans have lips? He doesn’t say much about it but there’s one very lyrical passage. I’ll read it to you later because it’s quite charming, like a little ballet of the face. He speaks so well that you can tell this is someone who knows his subject.</p><p>But what does that mean? The lips, which are so important for the human mouth, are the mucous membranes that extrudes. It’s rare, it’s very singular, a mucous membrane that extrudes. If I’m not wrong, animals don’t have lips. Which means that their external skin hardens, I hope. And yet I’m disturbed when I look at a cow because it seems like it has lips, but it surely isn’t the case. It’s the external skin that hardens. In this sense the cow’s head is part of its body. I have the impression that apes… but sadly the professor doesn’t speak about this. I don’t know but if you look closely at an ape, it seems to have a kind of… hardening of the skin. It’s not at all the inversion of the internal mucous membranes.</p><p>I implore you… if anyone has an objection, please keep it for yourself. [<em>Laughter</em>] It’s essential. In any case, we would have to ask a vet: if any of you know one, ask them. But they will only say yes, and if they say no… look hard until you find a vet who says yes. However, it’s not that important. Let’s suppose that next week someone tells us it’s false. It’s not important. You have to understand that there are two types of lips, which are completely different. I mean to say, there’s a point at which an idea cannot be false. It becomes impossible.</p><p>I’ll say that the human mouth has lips and that the lips are a deterritorialized mouth. The mucous membranes which form the walls of the bodily cavity, in extruding themselves become deterritorialized. The deterritorialization of the muzzle, the head, I don’t know what to call it, through the human mouth, is very different from the deterritorialization of the hand… but that doesn’t mean they don’t go together. It too has a correlative. But what is it? The same professor teaches us that only humans have a mouth endowed with lips but only women have breasts. Irrefutably so.</p><p>What do animals have? They have what are technically referred to as mammary glands. Any vet will make a distinction between mammary glands and breasts. And the difference is the following: the breast is a deterritorialized mammary gland. Because of its vertical stature. But why is this? What is the difference? The technical difference appears to be that the breast is a mammary gland surrounded by adipose and muscular tissue. Therefore, while the mouth with its lips is a deterritorialized muzzle, the breast is a deterritorialized mammary gland. Here I would add something quite significant: already in my two couples, <em>hand-tool</em> or <em>hand-use object</em> and <em>mouth-breast</em>, we can identify a first law of deterritorialization. It’s fun to make a series of laws, or theorems of deterritorialization.</p><p>Here is the first theorem of deterritorialization: when two organs are deterritorialized in a complementary rapport, one reterritorializes on the other and vice versa. [<em>This list of theorems differs from the list given in</em> A Thousand Plateaus <em>starting on p. 174</em>] So, a theorem of great clarity. The hand is a paw, the prehensile hand is a deterritorialized paw or a deterritorialized musculoskeletal hand that has become empty, ripped from the earth or the trees. Its correlative is the tool, which at a lower level is a deterritorialized material… [<em>Tape</em> <em>interrupted</em>] [24:13]</p><p>… Territoriality, deterritorialization and reterritorialization constitute three notions that are not reducible to each other. Reterritorialization is a highly specific operation. Usually, it occurs in the context of what we call artifice or artifact. An artificial tool. The breast… okay, if we don’t yet have an artifice in vertical breastfeeding, the baby bottle is in any case an artifact. So, the mouth’s reterritorialization on the breast and that of the breast on the mouth constitutes breastfeeding.</p><p>And here we have a further deterritorialization. Notice that I remain within the dimensions of the deterritorialized body. Even the mouth I consider a cavity. I said that the mucous membrane extrudes: the mouth still pertains to the body. Third deterritorialization: the face, which here is fully the deterritorialized animal head, following which… I will tell you later. Obviously, it’s not the genetic axis, the paw which became a hand, vertical stature, a thousand other things.</p><p>The face I will define not through the mouth but precisely through the eyes, the eyes that see. The story of the gaze is valid for animals. It’s animals that look. It’s the human face that sees without looking. Which is why it’s so horrible. It really is a horror story that I’m recounting. The partial object is nothing by comparison. The real horror. The eyes, the face… what do they do? In any case, I am saying, we have a movement of deterritorialization that is perhaps more… much more intense… which doesn’t mean it isn’t much slower than the others. By being slower it arrives at its goal, at its aim, less quickly. Hence, the illusion of the genetic stages… [<em>Tape</em> <em>interrupted</em>] [27:21]</p><p>… The second theorem of deterritorialization: faster deterritorializations do not necessarily come first. What’s more, faster movements presuppose slower ones… [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [27:44]</p><p>… What is the first landscape, after all? As many authors have shown, the first landscape is the steppe. It’s there that for the first time the gazeless eyes see. On the steppe. Before, we had to look. Why? The old evolutionists explain it well. The first environment, the real animal <em>Umwelt</em> is the forest. Note that in the forest there are no hands, no prehensile… no, sorry, I meant musculoskeletal hands. The ape swings from one branch to another. Perhaps we have the beginnings of a prehensile hand, but very, very limited. There’s no mouth, no face. Nor is there a voice. There’s too much noise in the forest to be able to speak. They can’t speak. The apes have, to use a nice expression, laryngeal sacs that don’t enable them to speak. You need a supple larynx to be able to speak, and in the forest, they don’t have that. It’s not possible. The supple larynx is a deterritorialized larynx. Everywhere we are traversed by movements of deterritorialization.</p><p>And I was saying that the steppe is the first landscape. It’s the complement of the face. The face reterritorializes on the steppe and the steppe reterritorializes on the face. But what is the steppe? It’s a deterritorialized forest.</p><p>And here we come to my third theorem of deterritorialization. Up until now we’ve only considered complementary reterritorializations at the same level. The hand reterritorializes on the tool and the tool on the hand, the mouth on the breast and the breast on the mouth, the face on the landscape and the landscape on the face. But in the other sense, I make a scale, an intensive scale. An intensive scale that I define in function of the relative speed and intensity of the deterritorializing movements that take place at each level. I’ve already looked at three, one, two, three.</p><p>And here I would add that those that take place more slowly are the first to occur. The last to arrive are the first to occur. That’s why genetic psychology gets it wrong, as do theories of partial objects. This way, we can get rid of them all in one fell swoop. Good. And, in this case, all this happens from lowest to highest, from fastest to slowest. A reterritorialization of the faster movements on the slower… [<em>Tape interrupted</em>]</p><p>I’m almost done with this… and now at least we have the solution to our second set of notions. Sorry if I spoke at such length… I will stop before the third — what time is it now? — so that you might speak a bit. We have a solution, or at least the confirmation of a solution: this business of power apparatuses.</p><p>If I go from one to two to three, I can say that the third – face-landscape – is at the same time the slowest movement and yet the most intensive, and therefore the most deterritorialized. That of the hand is the fastest. It is already a deterritorialization with a complementary reterritorialization. And it is the least deterritorialized. Reterritorialization occurs from the least to the most deterritorialized. And that’s what the artifice is. So, third theorem: we call artifice a reterritorialization of the least deterritorialized on the most deterritorialized.</p><p>So then, [<em>Deleuze laughs</em>] everything works out fine! No, I’ll stop there, you’re fed up with all this. [<em>He continues laughing, pause, he turns toward the drawing on the board</em>] So, yes, everything works out fine. We shouldn’t be surprised that certain power apparatuses need both face and landscape. It’s the same forces that establish faces and make environments. So, are these the same forces that need to keep us attached to a white wall or to plunge us into a black hole? Without doubt.</p><p>So, these power apparatuses would need both the abstract machine of faciality – white wall-black hole – and the concrete movements of deterritorialization, that is: the most deterritorialized on which everything artificially reterritorializes – just as we said at the beginning when we began this study of the face – will overcode that which has lost its code.</p><p>And what is it that has lost its code? Everything that pertained to territoriality, that is to say the animal body or human corporeality which has never ceased to be deterritorialized, more and more, and to be reterritorialized by artifice and which, having lost the codes of corporeality, must be overcoded, thus so many that we have lost corporeality with maintenance of territorialities; even if these territorialities are of a nomad type – what we call “primitives”… nomadic, semi nomadic or sedentary peoples — there is absolutely no need for faciality, nor for power apparatuses that produce face, nor for their abstract machines. These peoples have their own, but not of that type. They have other abstract machines: abstract machines of dance, abstract machines of gesture… [<em>End of the recording</em>] [36:28]</p><hr><a href=#lecture-7-rhizomes-assemblages-of-power-and-territorialized-assemblages-of-enunciation><h1 id=lecture-7-rhizomes-assemblages-of-power-and-territorialized-assemblages-of-enunciation><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Lecture 7: <strong>Rhizomes, Assemblages of Power and Territorialized Assemblages of Enunciation</strong></h1></a><blockquote><p>I can say that since we began, everything we have done up to this point is to consider three topics.

The brief subsequent session (to minute 29) is the sole session for which a date is certain, February 3, 1976, stated by an Iranian student during the session. Having concludes the opening fragment with a review of the previous sessions’ topics, notably, the <em>rhizome</em> in opposition to the tree, a <em>theory of redundancy</em>, the problem of <em>faciality</em>, Deleuze commences the February 3 with discussion the face-power assemblage, hoping that others will discuss the close-ups role for the face and in cinema. He mentions facial tics and verbal slippages and links these to the face’s constant binary choices, instigating dichotomies and assigning places, but then defers to Guattari who addresses the ways in which a machine of faciality helps establish decoded flows in capitalist flows, in contrast to territorialized assemblages of enunciation within primitive societies where faciality functions differently. Guattari returns to the four-eyed machine drawing (developed in the previous session), describing the face as a kind of oscillograph establishing what is allowed and what is forbidden through shifting corporeal attitudes and semiotics. Following a recording interruption, the discussion opens to student interventions, notably a student (identified as Éric) dominating the exchanges, but an Iranian student succeeds in announcing details of an important demonstration occurring that very day, to which Deleuze lends his support with plans to cut the session short., to allow students time to reach the demonstration, also mentioning a general assembly at Vincennes the next day.</em></p><p><strong><em>Il Senso in Meno,</em> Part 6 –</strong> <strong>Rhizomes, Assemblages of Power and Territorialized Assemblages of Enunciation</strong></p><p><strong>Translated by Graeme Thomson and Silvia Maglioni; revisions and time stamp, Charles J.

The first of these was the <em>rhizome</em> in opposition to the tree. The second topic was to investigate or sketch out a sort of <em>theory of redundancy</em>. Thirdly, we looked at a particular problem: the problem of <em>faciality</em>. Do I think there is something that links all of this? In a way, they relate to the same thing but in a kind of magma because, behind the screen, behind the wall, or outside of the black hole, when the different lines enter into new relationships… landscapity… that is… when faces come undone to the benefit of their traits, when landscapes are unmade and no longer hold in place their traits of landscapity, everything enters into new relationships.

Faces flow towards the black hole, that is, all faces will come to resonate in a single black hole. So, there you have it. Next time we’ll look at a different topic… [<em>Tape interrupted; here ends the summary of the five preceding sessions, quite possibly in a sixth session for which the recording is missing</em>] [2:19]</p><p>[<em>Here begins the next session, February 3, 1976</em>] … [We’ll continue], if you bear with me, focussing on two essential points. Firstly, the face-power assemblage, because in this rapport there’s something we still have to consider, something I still can’t figure out. Why do power assemblages need faciality? The second topic, if we don’t have time, I would like some of you more qualified than me to speak about it next time… is the question of the close-up… the question of the close up in the history of cinema and the role of both the face and the close-up in cinema. What worries me… do you really want to say something?</p><p>A student (near Deleuze): No, no…</p><p>Another student: [<em>Inaudible</em>]</p><p>A third student: A question, may I? I’d like to ask a question.</p><p>The second student: [<em>Inaudible</em>]</p><p>The third student: The next time, I want to talk about the French language!</p><p>Another student: Ah, we know all about that.</p><p>The third student: No, no, no, no, no. Will you let me have just one minute?</p><p>The other student: Just one minute?</p><p>The third student: Yes, yes… [<em>Comments lost in the general noise</em>]</p><p>Deleuze: Will you stop bickering all the time? It’s exhausting!</p><p>Another student: I’m not asking a question. I want to tell a story if you let me…</p><p>Another student: So, let’s hear your story then.</p><p>The first student: Thank you! Are there others who want me to tell it? [<em>Deleuze is heard laughing; pause and relative silence of students</em>]</p><p>Deleuze: Yes, there’s… I don’t know, there’s a problem that worries me… It’s the story — I also have a story — the assemblages of power, you recall, we began with a very simple idea. On the white wall of the signifier, the signifier inscribes its characters, which are not information but orders. “You will do this!” and it’s at this point that the face intervenes. The face intervenes because it guides us in what linguists famously call binary choices. These binary choices are for example: What did I hear? Did I hear “old <em>billiard</em>” or “old <em>pillager</em>”? What was it? What did I hear? [<em>On this example, see</em> <em>Michel Foucault,</em> <em>Death and the Labyrinth: The World of Raymond Roussel</em>_, trans. Charles Ruas, (New York: Continuum, 2004, 15)_. <em>Deleuze adopts his example from Roussel frequently, notably in Logic of Sense, trans. Mark Lester with Charles J. Stivale, ed. Constantin V. Boundas (1969; New York: Columbia University Press, 1990), pp. 38-39; new ed. (New York and London: Bloomsbury, 2015), p. 41. See also sessions 14, 15 and 16 in the Cinema seminar 4 (March 5, 12 and 19, 1985), and session 7 in the current seminar (December 12, 1985)</em>]</p><p>And if the face makes redundancy with the redundancies of language, it’s because I let the face guide me. What does it mean when traits of faciality escape the face? For example, all at once a teacher who appeared serious and had the trust of the headmistress starts acting crazy. Or, and this is stated by a famous name [<em>The phrase cited next is one that Deleuze attributed to Kierkegaard,</em> Traité du désespoir_, although according to Ronald Bogue, the phrase is not found in the Kierkegaard text; see Bogue, “The Art of the Possible,”_ Revue internationale de philosophie_, 24.3 (2007), p. 278_], a respectable man sitting at the dinner table with his wife and children suddenly blows it, undoes his collar and screams: “The possible or I shall suffocate!” The children fix their black holes on daddy while the mother says: “The possible or I shall suffocate? What?” And we look at his face and we see that he no longer has one. The traits of faciality have freed themselves from the face’s domination.</p><p>Facial tics are very moving. A tic, a tic… it’s a kind of gentle effort, an effort that enables traits of faciality to subtract themselves from the imperialism of the face. A tic arrives out of the blue but is, at the same time, always controlled. That’s what characterizes a tic, otherwise it wouldn’t be a tic. It’s always controlled by the face that recomposes itself. There are some admirable tics. Specialists of tics give them a bad rap. But it’s good to have tics… though not too many. And then… there’s no time to go into it more.</p><p>So, we were saying that there are traits of faciality, that the face guides us in binary choices, as linguists call them. This is very useful for power since binary choices are actually orders. To make a mistake in a binary choice, to mistake a <em>v</em> for a <em>p</em>, what does this mean? It means being a bad pupil… and why? Mistaking a <em>v</em> for a <em>p</em>, or 100 for 10, none of this is information, it’s the transmission of orders – both at a social level and at that of the most obvious power assemblages.</p><p>So, the question I can’t manage to figure out is: we would have a more flexible and precise hinge between power assemblages and faciality if we managed to show how and why the face has a fundamental rapport with binary choices: that is to say, how and why the face instigates dichotomies in every direction. You are a man or you’re a woman, you’re rich or you’re poor. Look at your face! You’re a woman. Why do you dress like a man? But you’re poor, look at you! And you expect to have the right to come in here. Here… a poor guy like you. Rich, poor, boy, girl. You’ll tell me that it’s not just a question of the face. But yes! In certain power assemblages, in certain semiotics, it’s the face that will function, it’s the face that will be in charge of enunciating and assigning places. As though the face instigated dichotomies that are actual knots of arborescence. The face is a tree, the black hole is a tree, the wall is a tree. That’s it.</p><p>But in what way does the face create dichotomies? I don’t know… Guattari has understood this better than me, he’s gone farther on this point, and that pisses me off because there’s something I don’t fully understand, there’s something that escapes me. I completely understand binary choices, for example in language, and the role of the face with respect to the binary choices of language, and I know there wouldn’t even be language if a machine of faciality didn’t connect to the axis of signifiance. But here there’s something that escapes me, I don’t get it… In what way does the face dichotomize everything? And why does it do so? It’s not enough to say: “Because we have two eyes, two nostrils.” Please tell us… I can’t figure it out, I’m blocked.</p><p>Guattari: I don’t know whether this is the right context…</p><p>Deleuze: So, forget about it. Let’s speak about something else. We can discuss this next time…</p><p>Guattari: I’m sorry… I’ve got a bit of a cold. I just want to say a couple of things for the moment. The question is to know how, in its most general form, a machine of faciality contributes to establishing what I call capitalist flows, what in <em>Anti-Oedipus</em> we called <em>decoded flows</em>. Decoded flows, because they can exist outside of “capitalist” societies, while also menacing primitive societies. I wasn’t planning to intervene during your presentation. It’s a bit annoying because I’m introducing some ideas that we’ve not already discussed together. I need to explain them to myself before I can explain them to others.</p><p>Anyway, in what I would call <em>territorialized assemblages of enunciation</em> — for example, “primitive” societies, or a group of children and so on – faciality doesn’t have the same function. It doesn’t function as a reference of a place, as Gilles said, around which the point of arborescence of the ensemble of coordinates, or of the world, is organized. In societies typified by capitalist flows the face is a bit like… as they tell you at primary school, the support polygon with its centre of gravity. The face is a kind of polygon of all the coordinates, with a centre of gravity in the form of a black hole around which everything is organized.</p><p>This support polygon of general coordinates in a territorialized assemblage of enunciation is the territory itself. The territories and the most territorialized semiotics had to be deterritorialized in order to produce a face and a landscape, to constitute a <em>facialization</em> and a <em>landscapification</em>, as Gilles said last time – these are the result of this operation of deterritorialization. And this is accompanied by a general semiotic collapse. Meaning that all the semiotic components – gestural, ritual, corporeal, whatever you can imagine – no longer operate on their own account but must always refer to the point of arborescence.</p><p>In primitive societies too, people referred to a point of arborescence. However, this wasn’t centred on the face but on the territory. So, there was a translatability, a redundancy, a comprehension of all these components in relation to a territory, whether it be through a tree, a ritual, a sorcerer or whatever… What was outside the territory was considered an outland, a non-world, something that implied a negotiation and an exit from the territory. With the advent of the faciality machine, we will no longer have a rupture marking “our” world, “our” territory – where corporeal traits are inscribed among the other elements – for example Native Americans who paint their faces form part of a landscape ensemble. It is neither face nor landscape, but part of the ensemble of the territory. Here, we have a double operation. On one hand you have a concentration of the elements of signifying redundancy on the face around the black holes of the eyes. On the other, you have a universalization of the ensemble of territories. Hence, it is presumed that nothing escapes comprehension through the face. A face is always the centre of signifying coordinates. And, what’s more, the territory is vast. We tend to say: it’s France, the world, white people, civilized people, normal people, men and so on. It’s clear that all this constitutes a fascistic conception of universality. The signifying coordinates impose a very specific type of world.</p><p>Here I’m speaking quite generally. How do we get to the problem Gilles has posed? If I manage to get there… it’s that when you look at a face… We introduced the idea of a four-eyed machine. The four-eyed machine consists in looking not at the eyes but at a point determined by the symmetry of the eyes. If you give me a moment, I’d like to tell you a dream I had so you can understand me better. One day, I dreamt about a woman who was looking at me. It was in a crowded space. Suddenly, I was captured by what I would say was her gaze – not her eyes. Then, I noticed that the way this woman was looking at me was quite bizarre. I was completely fascinated. And, suddenly, there was a flash. A very strange thing… a third eye appeared, very big, in the middle of her forehead that centered the two eyes. We can say that the black hole is not an eye in particular but rather the operation of symmetrization of all values, which permits there to be a central point for the organization of the coordinates.</p><p>To return, if you will, to the system of alternatives, a face functions like a kind of oscillograph establishing what is allowed and what is forbidden. There are always standard deviations around which a face oscillates. You can smile but not too much because if it turns into a grimace, you must be mad, delinquent, stoned or whatever. The ensemble of corporeal attitudes themselves, other semiotics continues to exist. We’re not saying there is just the face. But these are captured by the arborescence of the face. They’re recorded on a central computer, on the central oscillograph, which tells us what they’re supposed to mean.</p><p>Deleuze: Actually, clothes are a facialization of the body…</p><p>Guattari: Like make-up and what have you… Starting from this point, we are in a better position to understand the operation of binary either/or systems. In territorialized assemblages of enunciation, what I will call “the possible” — what it’s possible to do, possible to say, in whatever register, marriage, ritual, play etc. — is framed, organized according to a territory. If one leaves this territory, if something foreign appears, it requires a whole semiotic effort, a process of semiotization to be able to interpret and reframe this within the frame of the possible. If you leave your territory, there’s a whole series of steps you have to take because you’re entering a world in which the possible is no longer framed. For example, a cow dying is a strange event that we will try to frame within the possible – had it become rabid and in what conditions, whether this was caused by a certain act — then we reintroduce the event of the death of the cow within the new frame of the possible.</p><p>In the other figure of the individuation of enunciation, or the power of faciality, the whole of the possible is already framed, nothing can escape the double articulation, or the signifying rupture – to employ an old expression we’re not too fond of – that the face performs. In fact, in a primitive society, we have the feeling that what occurs in terms of inscription upon the face takes place upon the territory. Outside, are the others. But in these others, there is space for a whole possible world to open up. Nowadays when a white person looks at a black person, or an Algerian, they don’t situate them in another territoriality but in a racist movement as a “non-other”. Fascist or racist universality wants all people to be adult, white, normal, heterosexual, phallocratic and so on. And you see this immediately, you see it on the face, you see it from whether he got it, was he crazy, etc.</p><p>So, the aggregate of the possible – he has a strange face, a weird complexion, he’s a suspicious guy… — is attributed and centrally coded on the machine of facialization. At the same time, [<em>Pause</em>] the machine where there were not yet faces and landscapes, where there were territorialized rhizomes within territorialized assemblages, had only a local ambition and left a great degree of liberty to the other components of expression. With the machine of faciality, all components of expression become unified and depend upon a single expressive substance. So no matter what comes up can be seized and divided by this machine of faciality. Nothing can escape the universal white power of the normal face.</p><p>Now what is this dichotomizing operation that takes place for example in informatics, when a message is decomposed into “bits” of information? It’s the fact that we can take the whole message and cut it a first time, so as to obtain a first division of bits, then a second time, obtaining a further division and so on. This will give us the formula of the quantity of bits corresponding to the number of divisions performed in the message. Thus, the ensemble of what arises can, on one hand, be unified, flattened on the white wall, while on the other, it can be divided up.</p><p>What accounts for the power of this division? What is it that permits anything to be divided up in this way whatsoever? If I pronounce judgement on the face of someone who belongs to my tribe, it’s possible since they are part of my framing of the possible. But a primitive tribesman would never say that the other’s is a “foreign” face. It’s not even a face for him. It might be an animal, an intensity, or something else. It’s not his business.</p><p>The principle of faciality on the other hand always gives one the possibility of dividing any enunciation or anything that presents itself. It’s like the TV news. No matter what happens, even if it’s the most extraordinary event, the presenter will always be able to say, and will always say: “But none of this is surprising to us… We knew it was going to happen”. If the Martians landed tomorrow, “oh yes, that’s not at all surprising”, because there is always the possibility of reframing it within the signifying message’s capture.</p><p>Therefore, the fact that a face is always interposed, and that it’s always able to divide and give a vertical and horizontal axis, a weight to enunciations, means that we see the world, we see the enunciations only in relation to this position of the face. The face can insert itself everywhere. And this is what allows this operation of potential dichotomization – not to mention the fact that all possibles are continually at the mercy of this system of divisions and there is no space for a rhizomatic “possible.” The possible is always subjected to a potential law of arborescence.</p><p>A rhizomatic possibility existed in its territorialized form within territorialized assemblages of enunciation. A machinic, rhizomatic possible will appear when the face is undone. And at that point the divisions performed by faciality will refer to something very different from territories, which is to say machinic assemblages. Or, as Gilles was saying, there will be an end of the face, a becoming-imperceptible, where there will be a dissolution of both landscapes and faces. Because the face always implies a nationalism, a regionalism, a familialism, a space of redundancy, and where faces and landscapes will plug into a series of intensities that will no longer be reterritorialized but this time, caught up in machinic connections. I don’t know if this is clear…</p><p>Deleuze: It works! [<em>Deleuze smiles at Guattari</em>] It works!

Following the occupation, the students were just about to leave the premises when the police burst in and arrested around twenty of our comrades. Giscard’s government has signed trade agreements with the Shah’s regime. Three billion francs worth last year alone. Farah Diba, the Shah’s wife, at the moment of the executions… Moreover,</p><p>Deleuze: Sorry, can I interrupt you a minute. We began our seminar exactly on this point. There is conflicting information… Some of us wish to be present at the trial, which begins in a short while. I was told it will take place at 1.30 pm in Courtroom 23. Is that right, 1.30, Room 23?

The militants will appear today, February 3, after being arraigned on January 28, before the Paris Correctional Court. Last piece of news: following a hunger strike, our comrades asked that the prison authorities feed them, and the prison guards responded by systematic sabotage, a regime of pyjamas only in cold cells. We ask for your active support in the liberation of our student comrades from the French authorities. So, there are also some final details: according to the law, they risk from one to five years of prison or direct deportation to Iran – which means certain death as soon as they arrive. So your support is of the utmost importance in this trial.</p><p>Deleuze: Besides what they’ve already suffered at the hands of the French police before detention.</p><p>The Iranian student: People are asking if there’s going to be a meeting.</p><p>Deleuze: There’s a meeting at six here in Vincennes.

Referring to Josef von Sternberg’s memoirs, Deleuze develops several general propositions about the close-up, and then he compares the pair of effects, lightening or resorting to shadows – to the white wall-black hole system. As for close-ups of things other than the face, Deleuze asserts (with reference to Eisenstein on D.W. Griffith’s cinema) that such close-ups occur provided that the thing in question is caught up in a process of facialization. Deleuze then undertakes to define the close-up by considering different cinematographic means, e.g., a mobile camera approaching a character or object, or a reverse process, close-up as a scale of intensity, and with various references, Deleuze joins the two functions of the close-up to two types of faciality, the despotic face and the passional face, but also notes mixed uses of types of close-ups. At this point, following a recording interruption, a 37-minute debate ensues among the participants regarding the unacceptably crowded conditions in the classroom. A notable moment is Deleuze’s concise argument favoring the smaller, more crowded space (for greater possibilities of student exchange) over the available amphitheater space (entailing greater distance from the students and less opportunity for exchanges). Deleuze attempts to bring discussion to a close by mediating between the opposing sides, mainly to remove the space-wasting tables henceforth, but also to remain in the current space, but at one point, he seems ready to abandon the session, noting how badly things are going, and he also admits to feeling ill. Finally, with no agreement reached besides Deleuze’s proposal, the session continues for another 30 minutes, with Deleuze considering two forms of delirium, specifically paranoid delusions (or delusions of interpretation) and passional delusions (or grievance delusions). He fleshes out these distinctions with numerous references, modern, classical and biblical, and he concludes the session by proposing that they continue to examine the two systems, the one irradiating, despotic, frontal faced, based on trickery and deceit; the other linear, passional, diverted faces, based on betrayal.</em></p><p><strong><em>Il Senso in Meno,</em> Part 7 –</strong> <strong>The Close-up in Cinema, The Conditions of Study, Two Forms of Delirium</strong></p><p><strong>Translated by Graeme Thomson and Silvia Maglioni; revised translation, Charles J.

But we’re going to suspend it for the moment, though not for long, not for the entire lesson… I’d like to suspend it because something didn’t work last time, so we need to do a collective auto-critique – personal auto-critique is a bad idea but collective auto-critique can be useful. We all agreed that it was just about time to close the chapter of faciality, that we had spoken enough about the matter. But perhaps we should be able to get something more out of the close-up in cinema.</p><p>And then I had the feeling – that I imagine many of you shared – that while many interesting things were said, we had failed to get anywhere. Something wasn’t right. And it was just as well to go on because things might have become clear all of a sudden, though it was by no means certain… I’m sure I’m not the only one but I had the feeling that something wasn’t working. And I asked myself why that was. How come we didn’t manage to get anything out of the close-up? Seeing as how that was the case… even if we were well placed… what I mean to say is that what we have to be wary of, always and in every field, are specialists.</p><p>Specialists are a really horrible thing, because they know so much, they know too much, and they’re so caught up in problems already coded in function of their speciality that, if you pose a question to a specialist, you’ll discover to your astonishment that there’s absolutely no chance of them giving you an answer. We could have asked someone from the cinema department, or else a critic. But in my view, it was better to avoid doing so. However, we were well placed to do something, whatever that might have been.</p><p>So why didn’t it work last time? I think that it’s because, even if it was interesting, what many of us said was linked to some kind of reminiscence: “Ah, I remember, I remember…” – and in a certain sense those memories weren’t completely out of place – “I remember there was a close-up…” It’s interesting, because I said to myself afterwards, our method – or the method that you accept or pretend to accept, me too – this <em>rhizome method</em> could have as its motto: “I hate memories. Nothing good comes of memories. Memories are actually a knot of arborescence.” But at the same time, how can we speak about the close-up without referring to specific films, which is to say filmic memories?</p><p>Nonetheless, I think that we failed somehow, because we got stuck in an exchange of memories, like old fools. So, we weren’t being specialists – which was a good thing – but we replaced specialism with a conversation of the type: “Ah yes, that film…” At the same time, of course, we have to cite particular films if we want to talk about the close-up.</p><p>I don’t know… I would just like to ask you for the next half hour, before going back to our new research topic on the two types of delirium, to forget what wasn’t working. Although at the same time I found everything you said quite interesting. But as I said, something didn’t work. In exchange, I would like it if somebody, maybe in a week or a fortnight’s time, told me that I got it completely wrong… I’ll just say, on behalf of us all, that we screwed up a bit, not much, nothing serious. We could very well say that, even if the situation were different, we would have screwed up anyway, or that maybe our ideas will be clearer next year. Anyway, let’s try something.</p><p>What I propose we do is almost… I have some topics… but I’m not at all sure… and then I would like you to react and propose things yourselves. And then we’ll stop there. And if things don’t work out again, it’s no big deal, we can just say that maybe this year it’s too soon to speak about the close-up.</p><p>We just need a few basic notions of cinema so as not make any howling errors. It’s not my case, of course. But perhaps there are some here who don’t know anything. And we just need a few memories, just enough to say: “Ah yes in that film, there was something of that nature.” You could go and rewatch it. Yes, but in any case… So here is my first proposal. And sorry if I seem… no forget it, I don’t need to apologize.</p><p>First proposal: as a theorem, a general proposition regarding the close-up as I found it… because I was so unhappy… though I liked some things that were said… I wasn’t happy with the way we failed to really get anywhere. So I did some research. And I’m sure that you know this great director, who boasted about having literally created Marlene Dietrich from nothing, and perhaps worse than nothing – and it’s with great bitterness that he says that – this director called Josef Von Sternberg.</p><p>Josef Von Sternberg published a memoir, which is translated in French as <em>Souvenirs d’un montreur d’ombres</em> (<em>Fun in a Chinese Laundry</em>) with Laffont. [<em>Pause</em>] [<em>Deleuze returns to von Sternberg’s cinema in Cinema seminar 1, notably sessions 8, 9 and 15, winter/spring 1982; he refers to this Sternberg text in</em> Cinema I: The Movement-Image, <em>p. 231, note 10</em>]</p><p>And here we are, in this book, I found a lovely passage that seems to me perfect for our purposes. Because considering where we are, and all that we have said so far about the face, this text completely confirms our theory of the machine of faciality to the point that we could say: “We can take it as our general proposition regarding the close-up.”</p><p>And I quote, it’s page 342-343… “The camera has been used to explore the human figure and to concentrate upon its face as being its most precious essence.” This works for us, there’s no need to comment on it. We have tried to say the same thing using other terms. We wouldn’t have said “its most precious essence” but that’s okay.</p><p>“Monstrously enlarged as it is on the screen, the human face should be treated like a landscape.” It’s getting better and better! So, for Sternberg, the close-up contains not only what appeared to us to be a fundamental correlation – the correlation face-landscape – without which there wouldn’t be a close-up, exactly in the sense that we developed it previously. But also, the close-up consists in the very treatment of the face as a landscape. If you want to treat a face like a landscape – Sternberg seems to be saying here – you can only do it by using the close-up in cinema.</p><p>“… the human face should be treated like a landscape, as if the eyes were lakes, the nose a hill, the cheeks broad meadows, the mouth a flower patch” — he’s obviously thinking about Marlene — “the forehead sky, and the hair clouds. Values must be altered as in an actual landscape by investing it with lights and shadows, controlled with gauze and graded filters and by domination of all that surrounds the face. Just as I spray trees with aluminum to give life to the absorbent green, just as the sky is filtered to graduate its glare, just as the camera is pointed to catch a reflection on the surface of a lake, even so the face and its framing values must be viewed objectively as if it were an inanimate surface. The skin should reflect and not blot the lights, and light must be used to caress, not flatten and wipe out that which it strikes.”</p><p>“The skin should reflect…” So what Sternberg is telling us is that the close-up’s function is to treat the face like a landscape in conditions in which the surface of the face reflects the light. So, there we have the first major characteristic of the close-up. There are already so many observations we could make at this point, but let’s stifle them for the moment and try to put things in order.</p><p>He continues and here the text gets a bit bizarre: “If it is impossible to otherwise improve the quality of the face…” — here he’s speaking about the second aspect of the close-up, as a kind of alternative – if it’s impossible to do what he was talking about before, that is to say, transform the face into a landscape that is able to reflect the light, we see that he has a preference: he prefers the first aspect, but says that there is a second aspect, and I don’t see why other filmmakers might not prefer this… He says that if you can’t manage to attain the first solution, there are other approaches you can take… — Is there a dog here? I heard a dog? First of all, I hate dogs and secondly, I’m afraid of them. Is there really a dog? At least it’s better than a cat, that’s all I can say… —</p><p>“If it is impossible to otherwise improve the quality of the face, deep shadows must add intelligence to the eyes, and should that not be enough then it is best to shroud the countenance in merciful darkness and have it take its place as an active pattern in the photographic scale. Before I allow light to strike a face, I light its background to fill the frame with light values, for included in its photographic impact is everything that is visible in the same frame. This principle of containing all values within a frame of values applies also to the human body and its movement through space is to be as a dramatic encounter with light. But whether face, body, a letter, a toy balloon or street, the problem is always the same: lifeless surfaces must be made responsive to light and over-brilliant and flaring surfaces reduced to order…”</p><p>You see the two aspects? Make light reflect through the face-landscape, or else if the surfaces are over-brilliant, attenuate and, if need be, darken it. Okay… If we decide to select this as our main proposition regarding the close-up, it’s obviously because it works for us. Here we find fully, [<em>Pause</em>] the close-up either makes the face reflect the light or else resorts to deep shadows, up to and including “merciful darkness.” So that suits us, since we find our white wall-black hole system. And if we might dare to correct Sternberg’s text, we could say that choosing the first aspect over the second is merely his own technical preference. We must recognize that there are also many directors who privilege the second aspect.</p><p>So, I ask myself, couldn’t we say the following… making some rapid comparisons? The screen is for sure, a white wall. The camera is for sure a black hole. So, couldn’t we say that there is a close-up when… – and here I’m moving towards a more abstract definition, but maybe it’s stupid, I don’t know – when the face tends to merge with the whole or part of the screen — which leads us to suppose that there are also partial close-ups that don’t occupy the entire screen; I’m pretty sure of this, but I don’t know, we’ll see… — when the face tends to merge with the whole or part of the screen considered as a white wall? So, it’s the face itself that functions as a white wall and is therefore identified with the whole or part of the screen. And similarly, when the face on the screen tends to be identified with or to function as the black hole of the camera. So here we have a first very general proposition regarding the close-up based on Sternberg’s meticulously precise text.</p><p>Second proposition: summing up quickly, I’d like to say that there are close-ups of things other than the face. In what conditions? We already have the answer, but we can verify it in the case of cinema since for the moment we’ve only considered faciality at a very general level. Naturally, we can have close-ups of all kinds of things. Though perhaps not everything… perhaps not just any old thing.</p><p>We can have close-ups of all kinds of things on the condition that the thing in question is caught up in a process of facialization. And this is the reason cinema is a modern art form and that the power of cinema requires the production of faciality, even if this faciality is abstract. I’m not saying that its production of faciality condemns cinema to a kind of realism or representation. We have already seen how facialization goes far beyond actual faces. However, in order for there to be a close-up on something other than the face, that thing has to undergo a process of facialization.</p><p>And regarding this point I’ve been given a very nice text by Eisenstein, where he says, again in relation to Griffith of whom we’ve already spoken a little… Eisenstein’s text begins like this, speaking about Griffith’s close-ups [<em>Deleuze cites this Eisenstein text in</em> The Movement-Image, <em>p. 91; this development on the close-up corresponds to chapter 6, “The Affection Image, Face and Close-up”</em>]:</p><p>“The kettle began it . . . Thus Dickens opens his Cricket on the Hearth. The kettle began it…”  So immediately there are new aspects to the question that emerge, when Dickens writes at the beginning of ‘The Cricket on the Hearth’… “The kettle began it.” Is he making a close-up here? Which leads us to ask: are there equivalents to the close-up before the cinema? Can we speak of an equivalent to the close-up in painting? Or in writing? And Eisenstein employs Dickens to comment upon all of Griffith’s close-ups.</p><p>And he says: “What could be further from films! Trains, cowboys, chases… and **‘**The Cricket on the Hearth’? The kettle began it! But, strange as it may seem, movies also were boiling in that kettle. From here, from Dickens, from the Victorian novel, stem the “first shoots of American film aesthetic, forever linked with the name of Griffith.”</p><p>Here we would already have some guidelines, if we could show that in fact the novel typically performs processes of facialization that concern use objects, which in a certain sense it contains like a precursor to the cinema close-up – if it’s true that the close-up either concerns faciality or produces facialization. The close-up could be of a knife. We’ll see… or of a kettle. Provided that in a certain sense the kettle looks at me. There, the kettle is looking at me, not in the grotesque sense of having two eyes, or maybe also in this sense, why not – the black hole of the kettle spout. Not surprisingly, Griffith’s interiors always look at me. They look at me in the sense that I’m caught up in these interiors, they regard me. Even if it’s not my kettle, it’s someone’s kettle. At the same time, we can ask ourselves if there are things that resist the process of facialization. And here too our theory will be confirmed. We can say that something that resists the process of facialization cannot be the object of a close-up.</p><p>So, the last time we weren’t too happy with what we did regarding the close-up. And it’s by no means certain that we’ll be any happier today, it might not go any better. At the end of the lesson, a number of you stayed behind, and Mathieu Carrière told us about a text he remembered by André Bazin on animals, that now becomes very interesting for us. [<em>In</em> A Thousand Plateaus, <em>Deleuze and Guattari twice refer briefly, without reference, to “an unpublished study of Kleist by Mathieu Carrière” (p. 542, note 50; p. 553, note 11), regarding becoming-animal in Kleist</em>] It ‘s a text where Bazin explains how we cannot make a close-up of an animal. But there’s a problem with the text. Carrière lent me the book which I read but I didn’t see the same thing he saw in it. I don’t think Bazin said anything of the sort… and in a way I’m happy. Although it seemed like a nice idea, it’s even better if it’s not in the book. Or at least I didn’t find it. But let’s suppose he says that: We can’t make close-ups of animals. What does that mean? You’ll tell me, yes there are, there are plenty.</p><p>The answer we gave the other time at the end of the lesson was this: that if you make a close-up of an animal in cinema it’s a way of suppressing the animal, of facializing it, of attributing certain things to it and therefore introducing a dimension of anthropomorphism. We often see a big lion’s head. But the great animal films don’t include, or include very few, close-ups. Which doesn’t mean that there aren’t worse techniques. What normally replaces the close-up for animals, for example, is the use of slow motion. In Rossif’s last film there is a terrible use of slow motion in which the animal is no less destroyed than it would be by close-ups. It’s unbearable. The use of slow-motion applied to animals might work a little, but overusing it, that’s ridiculous.</p><p>So why would it be useful for us to say. “Okay… no close-ups of animals, it’s not possible.” As we have seen, the animal is defined by a certain state – which by no means implies that it lacks spirituality, however its spirituality involves a system where the head is strictly part of the body and therefore is not organized through a face that overcodes the body. On the contrary, the head is part of an entire corporeal code. So, there can’t be any close-up of the animal if it’s true that the close-up is either faciality or process of facialization. That suits us. But we would also need to demonstrate that each time we have a close-up of an object, as in the case of Griffith’s kettle, there is facialization.</p><p>Third problem: The way to obtain – and here we might finally need a specialist who is able to tell us… no, it’s out of the question! – I ask, would it be inconvenient, and here I’m asking a question… would it be inconvenient to say that, as far as we’re concerned, we use the word close-up in a very general sense to account for effects that are produced by very different means? Because in the discussion that followed the last lesson, there was something that disturbed me. Among those who stayed behind, there were some who, if I’ve understood correctly, went as far as to suggest that the close-up doesn’t require or doesn’t necessarily require enlargement, that one could conceive of something that functioned as a close-up without any relative enlargement. I didn’t fully understand this… and then we stopped there.</p><p>So, as a way to orient ourselves a bit more clearly, might we not propose certain means, understanding that someone more competent in the matter might tell us: “no, this isn’t what we call a close-up”? All we know for the moment is that the close-up doesn’t necessarily imply immobility. A close-up can perfectly well be part of a tracking shot. Nor it does imply occupying the whole of the screen. For example, a face in close-up might occupy only one side of the screen. But doesn’t it imply a relative enlargement with respect to the other elements in the shot? I would say: yes, it does, but this is obviously just a question of means, it doesn’t help us to define its function. But I recall some of you saying that it doesn’t necessarily imply enlargement.</p><p>Let’s try to imagine some different means. The first, the most famous, for which the word close-up is normally reserved refers to a mobile camera approaching a character or object. Another means is the reverse procedure. And the reverse procedure is, I think, frequently employed by the expressionists…. [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [1:00:18]</p><p>The close-up considered as a scale of intensity has a completely different function. It implies introducing in the two-dimensional space of the screen something which is not reducible to two dimensions but which in this case is no longer time but intensity. Basically speaking, this allows us to say that the close-up has nothing to do with either depth of field or perspective. The question of how to add a third dimension to the two dimensions is a completely different one. The same goes for painting: if we find close-ups in painting, they shouldn’t be confused with problems of perspective. Otherwise, we’ll get everything mixed up.</p><p>And Eisenstein talks about his own intensive close-ups. Except that there’s something bizarre – I don’t know if it’s the English translation or the political constraints to which Eisenstein was subjected — Eisenstein says: my intensive close-up is a signifying close-up, it’s a close-up that has a meaning whereas Griffith’s close-ups are purely descriptive. It’s funny the way Eisenstein defends himself, as though he were talking to Stalin or Zhdanov, when he says: “I haven’t forgotten, I’m not simply showing things, I mean something by them, I haven’t forgotten the imperatives of the Party!”, whereas in actual fact one would have to say the opposite. If there’s a signifying close-up it’s that of Griffith, in its anticipatory values, whereas the close-up as scale of intensity is absolutely non-signifying, a-signifying.</p><p>And Eisenstein proposes examples from his own films such as <em>The Battleship Potemkin,</em> where there is what he himself calls “the line of mounting despair” which passes through several faces. You see this has nothing to do with anticipation, it’s very different… The mounting suffering or rage that passes through numerous faces, whether simultaneous or successive, creates a scale of intensity on the screen but we have no idea what it concerns. It doesn’t signal something which is about to happen. Here the process of mounting intensity is completely immanent. Are soldiers going to appear who will fire into the crowd? Or will something else happen? It’s very different from the knife close-up [<em>Pause; here Deleuze slips implicitly toward the example of Pabst’s</em> Lulu] in which the close-up’s function is to anticipate what will happen. At this point we know that Lulu will die, she’ll die, and that nothing will prevent it. In the intensive close-up, there is a sort of interiorization of the intensive scale that leaves what is going to happen off-screen.</p><p>So, were we to accept these two functions of the close-up, I’m saying that would be fine for me; were there only these two, that would suit me fine because they would respond perfectly to our two types of faciality as we have distinguished them: the despotic face and the passional face. So that would work well. The passional face is essentially caught up in an intensive scale while the despotic face is anticipatory. On the despotic face I read my destiny: “I’m going to die.”</p><p>But let’s imagine that between these two functions of the close-up there are multiple combinations. And on that point, I’d like to conclude with a quotation from Lotte Eisner, who speaks about an extraordinary scene that unfortunately I have no memory of. I saw it just once in my life, as usual at midnight at the Cinematheque. It’s in Pabst’s film, <em>Lulu</em>. And you will immediately see how useful Eisner’s expressions are useful for us.</p><p>“Many times, Pabst films Lulu’s features on a slant. Her face is so voluptuous that it seems almost deprived of individuality…” This works well for us. We’ve seen how individualization is an extremely secondary function of the face. It’s a distant consequence of facialization and faciality. And here I skipped a phrase because it didn’t really fit our needs. In fact, here she got it wrong, it’s obvious… To be honest what she actually writes is “Her face is so voluptuously <em>animal.</em>” What a clanger. This is false. Lulu is not… it’s completely stupid. Well, everyone makes mistakes… Especially as the next part shows that she’s not at all an animal.</p><p>In the scene with Jack, she’s inhuman which is completely different from being an animal: “In the scene with Jack the Ripper, this face, a smooth mirror-like disc slanting across the screen” – that’s much better… – “a smooth mirror-like disc slanting across the screen” – like a disc collapsed on the diagonal – “is shaded out…” – remember, that’s Sternberg’s second method – “the shining surface is toned down…” — that’s exactly the second type of close-up Sternberg describes – “that the camera seems to be looking down at some lunar landscape of which it discovers and in a way explains the curves.”</p><p>And here I’m skipping another phrase where she gets it wrong: “Pabst just shows, at the edge of the screen…” — if I understand correctly, this is the edge of the screen following the slant. And what we have here is a partial close-up that doesn’t occupy the whole of the screen. So, he shows this lunar landscape from awry. — “Pabst just shows at the edge of the screen the chin and a fragment of cheek belonging…” — Oh, no, it was me who was wrong there, he’s on the other side of the screen — “belonging to the man next to her” – Jack the Ripper – and then she says: “with whom the audience automatically identifies.” Here she makes a personal and rather forced observation, employing an abject concept of “identification”, which is completely pointless… [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [1:08:22]</p><p>So, we have everything we need. There are the two functions of the close-up. The anticipatory close-up: the knife. And the intensive close-up: the face of Lulu consumed, aged, falling apart, and Jack the Ripper walking towards her with what is in this case a reverse close-up of Jack the Ripper’s face which traverses a scale of intensity. Everything happens as though Lulu is the <em>zero intensity</em>. The zero intensity is the matrix. It’s negative, it’s not nothing. The zero intensity is the pure white wall. And with the black silhouette or the reverse close-up of Jack the Ripper’s face; there you have the other function of the close-up. The close-up as intensive scale is no longer the element of anticipation. What’s more, you have the two modalities of the close-up that respond more or less to Sternberg’s text. Which is to say: one in treating Lulu’s face as a landscape, which means making it reflect the light. Or contrariwise, attenuating over-brilliant surfaces by plunging them into merciful darkness. So, in this sense everything is here.</p><p>To conclude, here is the last proposition, which I’ve already mentioned: we would need to see to what extent the other arts have their own equivalents to the close-up. This would allow us to objectively define these equivalents in terms of both anticipatory-temporal and intensive values. In a text… And in my view, well why… we’d have to do some research, we’d perhaps have need to consider – I’m again speaking at random once again – both the novel and painting. You shouldn’t be surprised at my saying this. I’m regrouping some notions here. In all we have said so far regarding faciality and facialization, we have seen that painting had a fundamental role in its use of face-landscape complementarity and correlation. And that the courtly novel had a no less fundamental role in the white wall-black hole system of the face-landscape.</p><p>So perhaps we could… I don’t know whether I’ve already mentioned this but I’m going to go back to it. I’m thinking about some relatively modern painters. Irrespective of problems of perspective, which are of a completely different nature, I have the impression that often in what we call… when we have a still life that doesn’t occupy the whole of the canvas, but which intervenes in the painting, very often it is oddly facialized. We are at the level of the kettle that looks at me.</p><p>There’s a painter I really admire, Bonnard… If you look at Bonnard’s paintings, you’ll see that many of them are of his wife. There are many Bonnard paintings depicting his wife having breakfast. Bonnard’s cups are something extraordinary. There is a kind of facialization of the cup. And once again, everyone will grant me – here I feel a bit guilty — we’ve never used facialization in the sense of anthropomorphism. That doesn’t consist in attributing a human head to the cup. Facialization is an abstract function. Just as there is an abstract machine of faciality. Facialization doesn’t consist in transforming the cup into a man or woman but in making a white wall-black hole system. Or you even have dogs in Bonnard’s paintings, or cats, which are facialized in a quite bizarre way, and without a trace of anthropomorphism. I’m pretty sure of it. Or as Eisenstein wrote, we should take the example of Dickens, which is quite exemplary in literature. [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [1:13:56]</p><p>[<em>After the interruption, a discussion in progress unfolds, concerning issues of classroom space in Deleuze’s seminar</em>]</p><p>A first student: If we ‘re going to go on working like this, fine, but I’m leaving, and I won’t concern myself with why… [<em>Inaudible comment</em>] [<em>As this unnamed “first student” will lead most of the discussion, he will be designated as such below</em>]</p><p>Second student: It’s been 6 months!

Will you let me speak?</p><p>Third student: It’s more like three years that’s it’s been this way.</p><p>Several students: [<em>Indistinct comments</em>]</p><p>The first student: You’re wasting your time. It would take only a couple of minutes to sort it out. [<em>Deleuze is visible quietly listening</em>] Well, my problem is for him to move his ass!</p><p>Several students: [<em>Indistinct comments</em>]</p><p>Mathieu: If we remove the tables, 50 more people will come in and we’ll be back where we started.</p><p>The first student: Well precisely, that will create a problem, but maybe we might organize the space better than me, and at least 50 people have already left.</p><p>Deleuze: Please, allow me to respond in my turn. I’m not in any hurry, but … [<em>Pause</em>]</p><p>A student: This isn’t a criticism, eh? [<em>Pause</em>]</p><p>Deleuze: Yes, I think everyone has something to say, but we’ve already discussed it a lot, but you’re right to come back to this and to raise the question again, but we have spoken a lot about it. [<em>Pause</em>] So, if no one… [<em>Pause</em>] he’s right about one thing. The whole class has something to say, I too would like to say something…</p><p>Third student: But what cannot be denied is that most days this room is almost empty! There isn’t even a table normally. There are dozens of chairs stacked up. There really are some and in such a way that… [<em>Indistinct comment</em>]</p><p>A student: You think you’re in South America? [<em>Deleuze laughs</em>]</p><p>Third student: It’s true, that’s how it is… In that regard, we could at least organize it a bit better.</p><p>Several students: [<em>Indistinct comments</em>]</p><p>Another student: But the more places there are, the more people there will be!</p><p>Another student: Yes, but that’s not a good reason.</p><p>Another student: Instead of going on about it, why don’t we turn the seats around? [<em>Indistinct words</em>] Then you can see!</p><p>The first student: Now I’ll play like [<em>unclear word</em>] seeing as you were talking about cinema. Your idea is completely stupid. [<em>The student stand on a table and begins crossing the room going from one table to another</em>] These are our working conditions. [<em>Applause from some students</em>] It really is cinema, it’s playing at [<em>same unclear word</em>] …</p><p>Another student: Why are you getting so worked up about it?</p><p>The first student: It’s three minutes I’ve been trying to get in here.</p><p>Another student: Me too!</p><p>The first student: Hey, you guys there in the corner, aren’t you getting worked up about it? [<em>Pause</em>] Hey, I don’t want a chair.</p><p>Another student: If a fire breaks out… [<em>Indistinct comments</em>]</p><p>The first student: If a fire breaks out, I’m dead. [<em>Explosion of laughter and comments making fun of the student’s comment, general brouhaha; the first student begins walking back across the classroom on tables</em>] What I did there at least is without risks. All of you would rush for the doors.</p><p>Another student: That’s not true. There’s also a window where I’d go. I’d prefer to break a leg!</p><p>Deleuze: I’d die the first!</p><p>The first student: You’re right!</p><p>Another student: I know someone who has a different solution altogether. He doesn’t want to say it, over there, but he knows that by passing through the window, he can reach you over there.</p><p>Another student: Not anymore; it’s closed. Even today we couldn’t manage. The room’s full. The room’s full. [<em>Pause</em>] This has already occurred twice this semester. [<em>Pause</em>]</p><p>The first student: Instead of wasting our time arguing, we really could just push all the tables against the wall. There are three walls, three sides, which equate to as many as 100 places!</p><p>Another student: So that’s where we’ll really die! [<em>General brouhaha</em>]</p><p>The first student: So, what we have is exclusion, selection… Anyone who’s late can’t get in. In these conditions if there are 200 or even 3000 guys who want to get in, we’ll have to queue up like at the Opera, like the theatre. We come here at 7h30, and whoever isn’t here by 7h45 doesn’t get in. And if you don’t see Deleuze, he won’t get in himself because he’ll be stuck in the crowd. [<em>Laughter</em>]</p><p>Deleuze: That’s my dream… [<em>Pause, laughter</em>] I just want to say something, because it’s my turn, to respond to you, my point of view independent of the room, seeing as how you’ve raised a question we’ve already discussed many times. In any case, there is something which I would say he’s absolutely right about: the tables crept back in very recently. Before, there weren’t any. Now we’ll move on to other questions but it’s true that these tables occupy a lot of space… It’s not normal for the conditions we have in this room that there are tables. Up until this week, you permitted me a small table because I need books, but it was really tiny. All those tables and this big one were not here… I think that the first to arrive at the lesson should be so kind as to remove the tables, if there are any. More generally…</p><p>A student: But we need to keep two, one for the tape recorders.</p><p>Deleuze: Yes, of course. But more in general, the problem of this room has already been presented. I’ve already said I don’t want a lecture theatre. And not at all for the reasons that you impute to me, meaning lack of space to breathe, even if I do have certain problems in that regard, but that’s not the reason. It’s because I believe, and please don’t laugh, that trying to do what we do here in a lecture theatre would radically change the nature of the work. And no matter how uncomfortable things are here, everyone is free to intervene, anyone can interrupt me to speak about something else — and here we have the perfect example — none of which would be possible in a lecture hall. Because if we go to a lecture hall, I’ll be attached to a microphone – here’ it’s even worse, I’m connected to lots of other things, and I can’t even move – but the lecture hall would change everything. Because I would be in the situation of a formal lecture [<em>cours magistral</em>]. Of course, you might say: “But what is it you’re doing here if its not lecturing?” That opens another question but, in my view, no! that’s not what I’m doing. And if according to me I’m not giving a lecture it’s partly thanks to this room, which I cling to more than practically anything else.</p><p>If you tell me that things are bad, especially for those who get here after a certain hour, that conditions are unbearable and yet we have to bear them for three or two and a half hours… please believe me that I’m not trying to be funny when I say: I’m perfectly aware of this. I know everyone feels more or less uncomfortable, starting with myself, and I assure you it’s no picnic. I remember the good old days when I had a small corridor where I could walk. I like speaking when I’m walking, that’s how ideas come to me… But that’s all over now. I know, I’m not stupid… I know conditions here are pretty unbearable. Still, they seem to me better than the conditions of a lecture hall for what we’re trying to do. And I know some of you are suffering more than others, but I also know that everyone, me included, is terribly uncomfortable in this room.</p><p>I just want to say that I think there are advantages to it, and that a certain number of you here find it advantageous enough to want the situation to go on like this. So, I respond, without rancor, truly, or provocation, that if someone finds that the advantages this room offers – meaning the possibility of a certain kind of intervention, avoiding what would befall me in a lecture hall, avoiding the form of a lecture, all of that, being able to say anything at all… It’s clear that we wouldn’t have the same rapport in a lecture hall as we do in a room like this. Here the rapport passes by way of discomfort, but in a lecture hall, it would no doubt pass by way of a horrible embarrassment, even if we would be physically better off. Or even despair: “My God, we’ve ended up in a lecture hall!”, “Shit, what is this?” There are many different ways of being uncomfortable. I just want you to know, I insist that I don’t ignore the fact that the conditions for the people at the back are extreme. </p><p>Having said that, I fully agree that there are some stop-gap measures we can take. Getting rid of the tables seems an obvious solution. Make sure that those of you who are late getting here can move freely. I can even stop, if someone needs to pass this way. I’m perfectly okay with that. But I cling to the conditions of this room for reasons linked to the nature of what we’re trying to do, which would completely change in a lecture hall. And quite simply, if someone says to me, you’re being selective, I would respond in the same way as Mathieu: if we create 50 more places here, there will be another 70 people who arrive and we won’t resolve anything that way.</p><p>We gave ourselves a relatively small room for a working environment, not at all out of masochism or because we like to be uncomfortable, but because, and I’ll say it once again, what I want to say and what others want to say can only pass by way of these bad conditions. I don’t see any way we can avoid that. If someone tells me that the working conditions here are so unbearable that they can’t stand them anymore, once again my answer, without the least provocation is: too bad it means we can’t work together. Too bad, in any case I’m staying here. And I would stay here even if it meant being alone. Which would be a dream!</p><p>Sorry if I answer you in this way, but I really don’t think you could say: “Thing would be the same in a lecture hall. We would be more comfortable, and you could do the same as you’re doing here”. I said it. Things are as bad for me here as they are for you. I know it’s not a good argument but I’m not here to take a break.</p><p>The last question you raised, and that we’ve already discussed, is that of cigarettes… They don’t solve anything, actually they make things worse. I’ve always said that if we reached a point when it’s better to ban cigarettes, I would deny myself this as long as it was possible. Obviously, if I had an asthma attack, that’s tough for me, and I would stop for the day. And I would ask you not to, but if you didn’t agree, I would just go out. It’s simple, it’s not hard to understand.</p><p>Allowing or banning cigarettes from the room has to be a collective decision. So, it’s not up to me. Except when I have physical problems. Of course, anyone could have physical difficulties and say no, you have to stop. Or they could go out. Or we stop. Anyway, that’s what I wanted to say. But I insist on the fact that – I would almost like to strive to convince you, even if for me it’s clear – I assure you that if we go to a lecture hall everything will change. Everything. In the name of enhanced physical wellbeing, which I’m not even sure about – because lecture halls here are like coffins and they’re not so comfortable – everything would change including and especially the nature of what we’re doing here… [<em>Tape</em> <em>interrupted</em>] [1:26:46]</p><p>The first student: So, if I want to go over there, how do I go about it? I have to start the same rigmarole as before… [<em>Reactions from others</em>] Maybe that’s funny, but I’m no longer amused, I can tell you. For what I can understand the problem remains. You presented it fifteen minutes ago, and Deleuze gave his view. And there’s still a minimal density over there [<em>on the far side of the classroom opposite him</em>] and a dense population here [<em>behind him near the door</em>]. There’s still lots of smoke. There still are tables. This is perhaps a poor composition. I’m not trying to seize power; I believe what I said, these were some suggestions. You said: “even if I end up alone”; what causes me despair that that’s what might happen. I asked myself whether I should go or not. It would be ideal if you found yourself alone. Maybe only then would we really do something. The working conditions aren’t good, so if students say: “working conditions here are no good, we’ll go and do something else”, perhaps the situation would change.</p><p>A student: What occurs in the general population, I think, [<em>unclear words</em>] about people’s motivations that you’re talking.</p><p>The first student: Ah no, you think I’m an idiot?</p><p>Another student: [<em>Inaudible comments due to student voices</em>]</p><p>Another student: You’ve got a seat; you enjoy the system.

Only one’s going to get it…</p><p>The new first student: When there are 400 people here, they’ll be piled up to the ceiling. [<em>Pause</em>] Is what I am saying right or not? [<em>Pause</em>] So you see, that’s the way it is.</p><p>The woman student: I don’t follow your logic.</p><p>The new first student: What a shame.

[<em>Pause</em>] So until now… [<em>Pause, someone makes a comment to Deleuze</em>] No, non, but if possible next time… [<em>Pause</em>], this is the first time, it’s the first time the tables have reappeared.</p><p>A student: It’s sabotage! [<em>Pause</em>]</p><p>Deleuze: Yes, this is a sabotage of the classroom. Maybe it was you who put them there. [<em>Laughter, pause</em>] So, is there any way… [<em>Pause</em>] Right now, I think trying to get rid of the tables, that would really be a mess because… [<em>Pause</em>] Is there’s no way we can make a rotary movement that will allow us to …? [<em>Pause</em>]</p><p>Another student: We can break off for 5 minutes to move the tables outside! [<em>Pause, different reactions</em>]</p><p>Another student: Are you crazy? It’s already 12.10.

There would be much more space.</p><p>Other students: No, no, no….</p><p>Another student: No more on this topic; let’s talk about something else… [<em>Pause; diverse voices</em>]</p><p>A woman student: [<em>She is speaking to someone in a low voice, inaudibly, then</em>] … if there are no chairs, it becomes a room like any other… [<em>Pause, diverse voices</em>]</p><p>Deleuze: What? [<em>Inaudible comments</em>]</p><p>A student: No, it’s the same thing. [<em>Pause, diverse voices</em>]</p><p>Another student: Let’s stay here!</p><p>Deleuze: I think, at least in part, [<em>Pause</em>] following what you said… I am feeling things here; I can’t even think any more. I am feeling things, and I think: “My God! I feel worse and worse…” [<em>Pause</em>] So you arrive here [<em>Deleuze indicates the first student who spoke at the start of this section of the discussion</em>], and you say, “What is this? It’s my first time here, what is this? How awful we feel here! How awful you poor chumps must be feeling! What’s the matter with you? What is it with you that you want to feel like this?” So, someone says this, points this out, and I listen, and I tell myself: “That’s right, it’s true, we feel so bad…” [<em>Pause</em>] On the other hand – and in saying this, I’m not saying that you’re exaggerating – there are cases in which I’m sure that, even over there in that abominable corner [<em>Deleuze indicates the area near the entrance where the first student is located</em>], when things are working… [<em>Pause</em>] — I’m not saying for everyone, or for everyone at the same time – [<em>Pause</em>] we forget our discomfort, [<em>Pause</em>] we don’t think about it anymore. [<em>Pause</em>] Because, at that moment, things are really working well. We feel uncomfortable, but we forget about it… [<em>Tape</em> <em>interrupted</em>] [1:35:28] [<em>On the video, a new title sequence appears, as if this were a different day, but the same session and the same discussion in progress continues</em>]</p><p>The first student from the beginning: Simply it seems to me that…</p><p>Another student: … what’s more, they weren’t even listening; you have to start over…</p><p>The first student: I just want us all to be able to work in an egalitarian way, all of us seated in the same conditions. If it should happen that the group doesn’t agree that we should work in an egalitarian way, with everyone having a seat, and putting the tables against the wall so people can sit on top of them, if would only take 5 minutes to do that, instead of half an hour of arguments… if the group doesn’t agree to that, then I’m leaving.</p><p>Another student: So what do you do with all those who can’t get in when the others are all seated?</p><p>The first student: We’ll see about that later, that’s in the future!</p><p>Another student: The future has already been going on for years!</p><p>The first student: Let’s give the experiment a try, and then we’ll see!</p><p>The previous student: We’ve already tried it!</p><p>Deleuze: Yes, once more, I am responding to your proposal, but only…</p><p>The previous student: We’ve been working without tables here for years, and people always end up standing in the back.</p><p>Another student: But there are more people this year, I think…</p><p>Another student: That’s not true; there have been as many student for the last two and a half years…</p><p>The previous student: Listen to me…</p><p>The previous student: … It depends on the period. When the weather is nice, there are fewer here.</p><p>Deleuze: I would like to answer… Considering the hour, it is out of the question to try to remove the tables now. [<em>Several students say, “Yes, yes”</em>] As I said, it’s the first time the tables have resurfaced, and I insist on this point because… [<em>Interruption, diverse voices</em>]</p><p>A student: It’s not a question of removing them… just of moving them out of the way!</p><p>Deleuze: Yes, but even just moving them will take half an hour!</p><p>Another student: There’s not just this classroom, Deleuze’s class…</p><p>Another student: At 1 o’clock, there’s another class; at 4 o’clock, another class, and at 7 o’clock, there’s another class here, every day… [<em>Pause, diverse voices</em>]</p><p>Another student: Where do you want to put the tables?</p><p>The first student: I want to move them so we can sit on them! … [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [1:37:30]</p><p>Deleuze: This is what I propose we do. He made a suggestion and so here’s mine. I repeat, we won’t have the tables anymore just as we didn’t have them before. The tables will be gone, starting from the next lesson. It won’t be hard to get rid of them. If there’s a [<em>Deleuze indicates the entrance or the hallway</em>] there, a room where we can put them, those who need them for other lessons can go and get them there. Those who don’t want to remove the tables don’t have to do it. Those who want them gone can do it when they arrive and can put them either in the room next door or in the middle room. Starting from next time, no tables will be here except a small one for the books. There you have it… [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [1:38:36]</p><p>A student: It’s a question of adding some tables, not taking them away.</p><p>Another student: It’s not true because rats have no resentment against tables.</p><p>The first student from the beginning: I don’t give a shit.

[<em>Laughter; pause, diverse voices</em>]</p><p>Another student: What’s the reason… what’s stopping us from putting the tables against the wall? [<em>Students groan at this question</em>]</p><p>The first student: That’s what we were talking about earlier. Are you thick? This isn’t possible!</p><p>Deleuze: The answer is quite simple, which is there’s 20 minutes.</p><p>The first student: That’s what I proposed! Aaaah!</p><p>Another student: We only have 20 minutes left. It’s not worth it.</p><p>Deleuze: It’s true. There’s 20 minutes, and the time it would take is 20 minutes because… And where do you move the tables if these guys don’t go out first?</p><p>The first student: 20 minutes to push the tables against the wall?</p><p>Deleuze: Obviously, because everyone would have to go out.</p><p>Another student: And in 20 minutes the lesson is over. It ends at 1.

[<em>Pause, he continues smoking</em>] Okay, so we can agree [<em>Pause</em>] to make the tables disappear for the next time.</p><p>A student: Yes.</p><p>Another student: Yes, we’re agreed on that!</p><p>Deleuze: Fine. Isn’t there some way for someone to slide over a little… [<em>He makes gestures toward the crowded entrance</em>] there, along the wall?</p><p>A woman student: We can make a corridor.

[<em>Pause, diverse voices</em>]</p><p>A student: But there’s space on those tables over there, or do you prefer to continue suffering?

[<em>Pause, diverse voices</em>]</p><p>The first student: If they sit on those tables, those behind will have their noses squashed against their backs. So that won’t work on the tables, I agree. I’m fine with that.</p><p>The preceding student: So now it’s a question of the schedule. That’s it. Either we go now or we continue; if we continue, either you guys just grin and bear it, like that, voluntarily…</p><p>Another student: And shut your traps!</p><p>The preceding student: Or you park your carcasses on them [<em>the tables</em>]. For the moment, there’s no other solution, to do it voluntarily.</p><p>The woman student (<em>near the first student</em>): In any case, I don’t feel like sitting down, I don’t feel like doing anything now. I’m finding all this so delirious that …</p><p>The preceding student: Ok, we’ve understood. You’re disgusted. There’s only one thing left for you to do, that’s to get out!</p><p>The woman student: And you can stop being such a pain in the ass!

You’re all standing over there, and now you are standing there together, and you tell us you don’t have seat, and you say with such attitude.</p><p>The woman student: Ah, you’re being a pain in the ass!</p><p>The preceding student: Fine!</p><p>Another student (<em>the one who suggested she leave</em>): Time to go, darling…</p><p>Another student: And the same goes for you!</p><p>The preceding student: Why?</p><p>The other student: You ask why?

[<em>Pause, diverse voices, then a silence</em>]</p><p>Another student: Where do you see all these empty chairs since there aren’t any?</p><p>The first student: We would need 50 chairs to accommodate everybody.

Not again!</p><p>The previous student: [<em>Unclear words; subtitles:</em> Shut up!]</p><p>The first student: How do you explain that you’re standing and I’m sitting?

It’s better already.</p><p>The first student: Hey guys, when you’ll get finished speaking about my problem! [<em>Laughter, pause</em>] I know what my problem is.

[<em>Pause, diverse voices; she bends to listen to something the first student tells her</em>]</p><p>Another student: Will you allow me to decide for myself?</p><p>The first student: You want to regale us with your problems?</p><p>The student: We’ve had it up to here with your problems!</p><p>The first student: My problem is also yours? On that I agree. [<em>Pause, diverse voices</em>] So the solution to solve everyone’s problems… is for me to leave.</p><p>A woman student: No, no, stay. Stay! [<em>Pause, diverse voices, laughter</em>]</p><p>The first student: Are you only inviting me, or the others too? [<em>He indicates the crowd behind him</em>]</p><p>Diverse voices: Everyone! Don’t go! Stay with us!</p><p>The first student: So, are you inviting just me or everyone? There’s 40 or 50 of us here. [<em>Pause, diverse voices</em>]</p><p>Another student: Are you acting as their spokesperson?</p><p>Another student: Stop that!</p><p>The first student: No, I speak only for myself. [<em>Very long pause, diverse voices, laughter</em>]</p><p>Dog: [<em>Barking is heard, also much laughter; voices of students in discussions, more barking</em>]</p><p>A student: So, give him a chair! [<em>Laughter</em>]</p><p>A woman student: We can’t manage to find it. [<em>The pause continues, also the barking</em>]</p><p>A student: It was Deleuze who mentioned the dog.</p><p>Deleuze: In any case, we must be precise: our lessons don’t lack variety. [<em>Pause, laughter</em>] So, there we are… I’d like to… The chairs, all at once the chairs became… [<em>Pause, Deleuze does not finish the sentence</em>] Everything’s fine for me, everything’s fine, I mean… In fact, I have a confession to make; I’m feeling a bit sickened. Two times we’ve had, we’ve really had a bit of internal variety during a lesson. The first times we spoke about the face… [<em>Noise, laughter; Deleuze and everyone turns to Deleuze’s right to someone near the board, off camera</em>]</p><p>A student (<em>near the board</em>): The close-up…</p><p>Deleuze: That’s right, the close-up. [<em>Pause</em>] And then when we spoke about the close-up, [<em>Pause</em>] And suddenly… — There’s this unbearable cur — and suddenly, these chairs have become, they’ve become a kind of proliferation: the fewer there were, the more… Well, that’s okay. So, I propose again what I was saying regarding the chairs, everyone will maintain the same discomfort, if you don’t mind, and I’ll speak again for another five minutes, and then I’m done for today. For the moment, we’ve finished with the close-up unless you have something else, and then we’ll consider it next time. We can still carry this [<em>A sudden brief high-pitched microphone sound from the film team</em>] <em>incompleteness</em> of the close-up with us.</p><p>I want to end today, going back to the topic we touched upon the other day, which consisted in saying this: in the end, there are two types of delirium – no, it wasn’t at the end’ we started with this — aren’t there actually two forms of delirium in the classification that concern something fundamental, which is to say forms of delirium without…</p><p>The first student: We haven’t resolved the problem, so I’m going!</p><p>Deleuze: Okay! [<em>Pause; voices of students complaining about the student’s words</em>]</p><p>The first student: This is the complicity of a group unable to resolve its problems…</p><p>A woman student: No, really, listen… [<em>Pause</em>]</p><p>The first student: Ciao!</p><p>Deleuze (<em>Pause for a small coughing fit</em>): Aaaah… And so…</p><p>A student: The man without a face.</p><p>Deleuze: It’s funny the way things happen, don’t you think? It’s funny… In this group of deliriums with no intellectual impairment, with no intellectual deficit, we identified two forms. And as we said, it wasn’t by chance that psychiatrists of the 19th century tried to confront this problem and in the end were poisoned by it… I’m speaking on one hand about the group of so-called <em>paranoid delusions</em>, <em>delusions of interpretation</em>, and on the other about the group referred to as <em>grievance</em> <em>delusions</em> or <em>passional delusions</em>. Next time we’ll look at some texts. [<em>Let us note that the distinctions developed here appear in Deleuze’s “Two Regimes of Madness”, from which the collection of essays takes its title,</em> Two Regimes of Madness. Texts and Interviews 1975-1995, <em>ed. David Lapoujade, trans. Ames Hodges and Mike Taormina (2003; MIT/Semiotext(e), 2006), pp. 11-16. The text was first presented, with Guattari, at a conference in Milan in 1974, and then was published in the edited volume</em> Psychanalyse et sémiotique, <em>ed. Armando Verdiglione (Paris: 10-18, 1975). On the paranoiac-passional distinction, see also</em> A Thousand Plateaus, <em>plateau 5, “On Several Regimes of Signs”</em>.]</p><p>I’ll remind you that the difference, even in terms of the schema, consisted in this: the paranoid delirium or delirium of interpretation was constituted around a centre, a matrix, a dominant idea and proceeded by way of circular networks, seizing upon everything, the most heterogeneous elements, a bit of this, a bit of that… [<em>Deleuze makes gestures left and right</em>] the chairs, a guy passing by the window; it seizes upon everything, everywhere, everywhere…</p><p>A student: The dog…</p><p>Deleuze: The dog! [<em>Laughter</em>]</p><p>A student: The man without a face…</p><p>Deleuze: And all of that… [<em>He makes a circular gesture</em>] it all forms a kind of expanding circular irradiating network in which everything is captured. And paranoiacs… proceed in this way. And not only paranoiacs.</p><p>On the other hand, you have a completely different form of delirium. In this case it’s as if a little packet – and here I need to use the word “packet” — a little packet of signs starts to flow along a line and then arrives at the end of a first segment and begins another segment. And after the second a third… In this case we have, in a single sector, signs that flow on a segmented line waiting for the first segment to be completed before beginning the second. It’s a limited delirium, beginning from an isolated packet of signs that pour onto a segmented straight line. A succession of linear proceedings instead of an expanding, irradiating network.</p><p>I know you’d like me to quote some examples at this point… but we’re not there yet. We’re not there yet. These are two very different figures. The passional is someone who has an extremely localized delirium, that doesn’t at all seize upon everything. And what’s more, they continue to be perfectly reasonable. There’s just one thing, a sign. In erotomania, which forms part of the passional delusions, there’s a sign that flows along its line and that has its history. After which the first proceeding comes to an end. And then a second proceeding begins. There might be a pause between the two. The passional remains calm, regains their strength and then starts over, and then it starts over. In this case, we have a linear schema. Are the two figures opposed or can they unite? </p><p>Today, I just want to say something more about these two figures. So, in the case of the first, the situation is quite simple: we have a kind of expanding spiral. Whereas in the second, we have a straight line segmented in one, two, three or four parts and so on. We began from delirium in general, and we discovered two types of delirium corresponding to these figures. But we could very well have taken up other matters, and that’s the point we reached the last time. We’re considering an historical figure: the Hebrew and the Pharaoh, the despot of Egypt, the Pharaoh and the history of the Jewish People.</p><p>What does it mean? I suppose that in terms of the despotic formation, whether Egyptian or otherwise, we find a figure similar to that of paranoid delirium. That is: an idea-matrix, a center, beginning from which, through the conjunction of the most diverse, heterogeneous signs, a kind of expanding spiral is created with either concentric circles or veritable spires. Regarding the history of the Jewish People, we discover a succession of proceedings.</p><p>Once again, let’s recall the basics of our method: this obviously doesn’t mean that the despotic regime is paranoid and that the history of the Jewish People is passional. In our method, they mean something completely different. Perhaps it’s a good occasion to valorize what we have been saying from the beginning according to a rhizomatic method that implies a cartography. This means that in maps of delirium… if we make the map of a delirium, not the structure, the map of a delirium, keeping in mind all its coordinates, this can be partially, or more or less partially, superimposed on the map of a historical proceeding, all the while bearing in mind the latter’s own coordinates. Therefore, it’s not at all a method of reduction.</p><p>I would just like to say at this point that next time, without the tables, we will try to frame all this in a more concrete manner, both in terms of delirium and of the history of the Jewish People. I would just ask… and it’s quite obvious that despotic-paranoid regimes with their double map paranoid delirium- despotic formation… it’s quite obvious that they proceed like this. Everyone can recognize a part of themselves in it, though we will have to furnish a lot of details. They proceed through this type of expansion, of circular irradiation, which captures signs of the most diverse nature in a continually expanding network.</p><p>In fact, if we look at the Old Testament, it’s striking what happens when the exodus from Egypt begins. We witness a succession of linear proceedings. Venturing into the desert, guided by Moses, there will be a succession of segments, linear proceedings marked by catastrophe. And each time he will remain sufficiently Jewish to recommence a new proceeding. And I’m happy that from the very first pages of the Old Testament we find Moses’ formula: proceeding or grievance, proceeding or grievance, punctuated by a number of segments. In the Old Testament, there are some interesting passages that will be important for us. But we would need to know Hebrew… it’s somebody who knew Hebrew who says this. And you feel it in the translation in the curious oscillation between plural and singular forms.</p><p>Here’s an example: a passage from Exodus says more or less… sorry I don’t know it by heart… they crossed the desert and arrived at the mountains of… I don’t remember where. “There, Israel made camp.” Apparently, it’s a very common phrasing in the Old Testament. I think it’s interesting because it could be said – and I think this would work, we could make a whole list of similar phrasings. I use the plural: <em>they</em> crossed, <em>they</em> walked, <em>they</em> arrived. And there, <em>Israel</em> made camp: all of a sudden using the singular form. It’s as if this passage to the singular marked the end of a segment. And then a new segment began.</p><p>What is this linear thing? I would like to continue with a point that will be of great importance, I think, for literature, psychiatry, politics, the more of a mix the better. If I tried to qualify in a negative sense – and for the moment allow me to use whatever words I use with caution – if I tried to qualify the two systems, I would first ask: what are they doing here, what is the <em>evil</em> of the first system – I say the evil – how do they spend their time in the despotic system or the paranoid delirium? In a certain sense, if we were really trying to describe what they do, the best word would be: they cheat. They pass their time cheating, duping.</p><p>Why do they deceive and cheat? It’s well known that the interpreter or the diviner spends his time duping and maneuvering the face of god. From ancient times, mobile masks and statues were maneuvered by priests, they had mobile statues so that the voice of god would appear to issue from one of the channels and so on… they cheat, they deceive. What’s more, in the irradiating circular system, to go back to that, one passes the time jumping from one circle to another. I’ll try to explain why we’re in one circle and then jump into another. There is a whole system of trickery and imposture. After all, the man of State is a deceiver, an impostor, not in any pejorative sense. I mean, you understand this is connected to what we are saying. We don’t wish to treat anyone as an impostor. We could care less about that. Rather, we want to arrive at a definition of deception.</p><p>There’s a book by Borges with an admirable title, <em>A Universal History of Infamy</em>. But when you read it, you can’t help but be disappointed because the book is terrible, completely worthless, I’m convinced of that. He completely blew it. You expect prodigious stories of universal infamy. What might those be? Someone should rewrite it, rewrite the whole book… Or at least try. Because on the other side, if we take our schema of linear successions, linear proceedings – we begin with one segment, we continue with another segment, etc. — what happens? There’s a completely new figure. We will have to see if it is <em>the</em> something new that arises. In attempting to use some words, I would say we’re no longer in the field of deception. It’s about a completely different field: it’s the field of betrayal. [<em>Pause</em>] So, we have two notions here: deception and betrayal. Deception is always an affair of State. But what about betrayal? Universal infamy concerns both deception and betrayal, but these are not at all the same.</p><p>Why am I speaking about betrayal? It’s one of the most fabulous themes of the Old Testament that I think has no equivalent. Take for example a character from Greek epic. Ulysses… it’s not hard to show that Ulysses is a great deceiver. And once again I use the word deceiver in a highly positive sense. The deceiver is perhaps the man of State. Take Shakespeare’s kings… We should reread Shakespeare’s great historical tragedies. They’re all deceivers. They all seize power by murdering someone – whether it be a brother, a brother-in-law or someone else – and then they say, that’s it. It stops here, we’re no longer going to kill anyone. From here on justice begins. And then they themselves are deceived. But in this process of the conquest of power through murder and the reestablishment of justice, there is a kind of fundamental deception.</p><p>But aren’t there also traitors, of a totally different nature? From the very beginning of the Old Testament, something surprising happens. Which is to say that God turns his face away both from one of his faithful and from his people. And in the same movement the figure varies: man or the people turn away from God, as in a kind of double turning away. It’s interesting… What’s happening here?</p><p>Let’s take a first example, almost from the beginning: Cain. I summarize the story of Cain. It’s very short but I hope you will reread it: Abel and Cain each make a sacrifice to God. We shouldn’t forget that Cain is God’s favorite. His favorite. God has always preferred traitors. Why? In any case… the two brothers make their sacrifices and bring them to God. The text says that God accepts Abel’s sacrifice but is indifferent to Cain’s…  [<em>Tape</em> <em>interrupted</em>] [2:08:04]</p><p>… Death indefinitely postponed. What does it mean? A slow death? No, not even slow death. Survival, life suspended following a linear proceeding. What does God say to Cain? Cain comes to him and says: “My crime is too great for me.” My crime is too great for me. And God replies: “But I shall not kill you. I shall even give you a mark such that no one dare kill you. You will be kept alive. You who are my betrayer. I who have betrayed you. And you who are my favorite.” </p><p>I speak of the prophet in opposition to the diviner. The prophet is an interesting figure. He is always someone who turns away from God. Which is to say that he is a traitor and is understood as such. The finest case, even if there are many, is one of the fundamental texts of the Old Testament: the story of Jonas. Usually, prophets have no wish to be prophets. God arrives and says: “This is what you’re going to do!” And immediately there is the turning away: “Oh no, no, no!” He turns his face away. The prophet is the one who turns away from God. “I run away from the face of Adonai. I run away from the face of Adonai.”</p><p>I am saying that Jonas’s is the finest case because God arrives and tells him: “The city of Nineveh is in sin. They are all sinners. They live in abominable voluptuousness. Things can’t go like this. You’re going to save Nineveh.”  And Jonas says: “I can’t.” He turns away and what does he do? Here too you have to go back and read the text, which is short and rather wonderful. The beginning of Jonas is almost a great comic text. In the Old Testament, there are a lot of comic texts. And this is a great one.</p><p>He goes in exactly the opposite direction. He literally does a runner. He runs in the opposite direction to Nineveh. God sends him to Nineveh and instead he boards a ship to Tarshish, which is cardinally opposite. So, he flees, he traces his segment of flight. Eventually, God will catch him and there is a whole part of the story where he keeps him in suspension in the shelter of a little tree. In the text, it’s called the tree of Cain. The tree of Cain… a connection is forged with Cain.</p><p>We’ll see there are other examples, many other examples. But you will also see that Christ, the story of Christ, can be understood only through and in function of this long history of betrayal. Why have you abandoned me? Why have you abandoned me? Meaning that God turns away from Christ just as Christ turns away from God. And what happens in this double turning away? There’s a kind of long errancy, a suspension of life.</p><p>There’s a film I’m sure many of you have seen – perhaps betrayal has a long history — a wonderful film called <em>Aguirre, Wrath of God</em>. <em>Aguirre</em> is the story, in a completely different epoch — his story could be considered part of universal infamy – it’s the story of a traitor who wants to be the only traitor. He says: “No, I am the only traitor.” What does he mean by this? “You can have as many deceivers as you want but I am the only traitor.”</p><p>In the dramas – and not surprisingly the film is very Shakespearean — in Shakespeare’s historical dramas and those of his contemporaries, there’s always, or at least very often, a bizarre guy who appears denouncing all the deceivers and tricksters. And the deceivers and tricksters are always men of State or men of the Court. And there’s someone who says: “Instead of ending up like that, I will go further in my infamy. I will go further in my infamy. I will be the traitor.” And he opposes betrayal to deception.</p><p>And Aguirre is exactly like that. If you recall, he sets off on a linear proceeding which will be one of betrayal. How is it possible to betray everything at the same time? That’s a good question. How is it possible to become the universal traitor? How do you betray everything, to found in the end a pure race with his imbecilic daughter? And you recall when he looks at one tall guy and says – it’s pure Shakespeare — “He is tall, he has an extra head. I’m the only traitor here!” and his aid understands and chops the guy’s head off. At every moment in the film the theme of betrayal is key.</p><p>So, I’m saying, Hölderlin wrote a book that is a, is really great, called “Notes on Oedipus” and “[Notes] on Antigone”, two short texts that have been translated, though I’m afraid they are out of print, in the paperback collection 10-18.  And he says something much more profound than what Hegel has to say about Oedipus. Hölderlin says something magnificent. He says that Oedipus is a modern tragedy, the only modern tragedy of the Greeks. Actually, in this he’s not saying anything exceptional. Even Malraux said something similar. He hadn’t yet honed it down, what he wanted to say precisely. But why does he say that it’s a modern tragedy? Because it’s the tragedy of slow or indefinitely postponed death.</p><p>And in fact, usually when a Greek hero commits an act of hubris he is struck down, or condemned, by a god. That’s not the case of Oedipus. Oedipus is exactly like Cain. He’s a Greek Cain. Oedipus, following the part of the story we know well, doesn’t meet a violent end. He encounters a long linear proceeding, the line of flight along which he wanders, keeper of a secret. And Hölderlin defines Oedipus as the man he calls the double turning away or the categorical turning away. Hölderlin was a bit Kantian, not excessively so, but he remembered the Kantian expression we all learned in high school, the categorical imperative, which in Hölderlin’s words becomes the categorical turning away: when God turns his face away from man and vice versa. And that’s where betrayal begins. What did Oedipus betray?</p><p>So, I’m thinking about a text by Nietzsche: <em>The Birth of Tragedy</em>, paragraph 9, in which Nietzsche makes a very interesting observation which goes in a similar direction. He says that bizarrely enough the history of Oedipus is not really Greek. He says more or less that <em>Oedipus</em> is the most semitic of the Greek tragedies. Because there is a passion of Oedipus, a passivity of Oedipus. And he goes as far as to say that there is a femininity of Oedipus.</p><p>All I wanted to say today, to begin the analysis we shall develop next time, is that we will need both these two figures: the circular irradiating figure, whose complement is the face viewed head on, the signifying despotic face, violent death or expulsion. And the other system, that of successive linear proceedings where we have a completely different form. In the first figure we also have trickery and deceit, if you like, whereas in the second figure we have faces that turn away, passional faces, life suspended on the straight line, whether in the wandering of Oedipus or the flight of Cain. Here we have a double turning away that defines something like a system of betrayal.</p><p>To add to the mix, there’s a play by Shakespeare that doesn’t represent a king or a man of State who seizes power by deception. It presents something else that might pose certain problems for the <em>mise en scene</em>. A great tragedy: <em>Richard III</em>. Richard III, in spite of appearances, doesn’t care about the conquest of state power. That’s not what interests him. He’s not a deceiver, he’s a traitor, and the great scene of betrayal is at the same time a scene of complicity, as though the double turning away were complicity itself. It’s the scene between Richard III and Lady Anne. Lady Anne, who completely understands Richard III, is terrified by him and says to herself: “This man has exceeded all limits.” And she already consents to the destiny that awaits her. There is a face-to-face encounter between Richard III and Lady Anne, in which the two faces never cease turning away from each other. [<em>On Hölderlin, Cain and Jonah, Oedipus, Nietzsche, and</em> Richard III <em>in this context,</em> <em>see</em> A Thousand Plateaus_, pp. 123-127_]</p><p>We will have to ask if later the Reformation, in its return to the Old Testament, didn’t seize upon this figure of the double turning away, the universal betrayal. How much did Luther have to say about betrayal? You understand that an abstract proposition such as “good works cannot save you,” this is fundamentally linked to the theme of betrayal. Meaning: even our good works betray us, and we betray our works.</p><p>So, I say all this simply to reinforce the two forms we have studied, once again, on one hand, we risk encountering: signifying face, violent death or exile, and trickery and deceit; on the other, the face turning away; life or death indefinitely postponed; double turning away that determines a betrayal.</p><p>I would be very happy if some of you could reread the stories of Cain and Jonas in the Old Testament. So, there we are. No more tables next time!

And this straight line is segmentarized. What form does it take? It’s segmentarized through a certain number of successive proceedings.</p></blockquote><p><em>The extensive discussion here (as in the previous session) develops material included in <em>A Thousand Plateaus</em>, notably plateau 5, on sign systems in relation to territoriality. The session focuses for approximately 36 minutes on an emotional debate among the students, as well as with comments from Deleuze and Guattari, about whether one student in particular — a woman who hurled an unsubstantiated accusation (possibly about plagiarism) at Deleuze — should be forced to leave the class. Once this matter is resolved, Deleuze continues for another 35 minutes in this part (Il Senso in Meno 8) and 36 minutes in the next (Il Senso in Meno 9).  Deleuze refers to the need for drawings (cf. <em>A Thousand Plateaus,</em> pp. 135-137), the first pertaining to a “center of signifiance” from which signs are distributed across concentric circles and from which, in the outside circle, emerges a line of flight. Deleuze then develops a second, passional schema, that proceeds through circular irradiation from a point of subjectivation.Based on these opposed schemas, Deleuze considers, first, how the schemas might be connected, even on an abstract plane, and second, what these schema refer to. Whereas the first schema corresponds to paranoid delusion and to the despotic social formation, the second schema corresponds to a passional delirium developed in early psychiatry and to flight from a despotic system. Then, following the aforementioned debate, Deleuze continues by considering binarisms and their link to the exercise of a certain type of power and dominant language in contrast to polyvocality of bodies, to which he links the two systems outlined earlier. Deleuze opts for Peirce’s terminology of signs (index, icon, symbol) to designate territorial movements and to create networks of signs on a kind of continuum. Calling this continuum on which everything occurs a first characteristic, Deleuze locates a second one in the system’s circularity, corresponding to the second schema. Thus distinguishing paranoia and interpretation, the latter allowing signifiance to be recharged from within, Deleuze concludes provisionally that humanity’s two maladies are signifiance and interpretation.</em></p><p><strong><em>Il Senso in Meno,</em></strong> <strong>Part 8 –</strong> <strong>Dimensions and Coordinates of a Multiplicity, the continuum of Signifiance and the Deterritorialization of the Sign</strong></p><p><strong>Translated by Graeme Thomson and Silvia Maglioni</strong></p><p>[<em>Please note that the transcription follows as exactly as possible the discussion in the filmed seminar, and therefore the translation differs at time with the discussion rendered in the subtitles on the YouTube versions.

[<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [2:23:57]</p><p>Deleuze: So, it’s good like this today… because I have to make some drawings… I have to make a few drawings because the last time I proposed a number of themes which were very disordered so you might reflect on them and so we might go about trying to organize them. So… at least we have chalk, but the blackboard is a bit dirty… [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [2:24:32]</p><p>[<em>For what follows and the drawings that Deleuze develops, see</em> A Thousand Plateaus_, plateau 5 and specifically the drawing presented on pp. 135-137, the first one pertaining to “signifiance”; as the recording begins again, Deleuze stands at the board having already drawn a version of the initial illustration_]</p><p>Starting from what was said the last time – and we’ve spoken about it a little – let’s call this the <em>schema of signifiance</em>. And we can immediately say why we have called it the schema of signifiance. Let’s imagine that we can reduce it to a point… Here, perhaps, we have a centre of signifiance. And around it we have a number of concentric circles… concentric circles or spires, spires of a spiral. And on these spires, we can place any kind of sign.</p><p>I want to go back to something that struck me during the last lesson. How did it begin? At the beginning, there was a dog barking at the back of the room. A dog where there shouldn’t have been a dog. So I’ll put it on the outermost circle: it barks, it’s a sign like any other. Or it would be a sign like any other… but in what conditions? If we were, for example, paranoiacs… The dog barks. He’s right to bark. And what happened afterwards? I was over there. I raised my head and suddenly I was afraid. This is an entirely different circle. I haven’t drawn enough of them. I saw someone masked, who was wearing a kind of S&M mask. I hadn’t noticed him before, [<em>Deleuze makes a gesture toward the back of the class</em>] I wasn’t expecting this. [<em>Pause, he turns back to the board</em>] A dog barks, a mask can emerge…</p><p>I said to myself that I was going to need all this for later. I was thinking that here there was an atmosphere, a phenomenon of <em>mundanization</em> or <em>atmospherization</em>. I saw it and I wasn’t the only one. Something was going to happen. I didn’t know what. I didn’t know where it would come from. And then on another circle there… someone who arrives who makes a sign, who emits his own sign saying: “It’s the first time I come… what are all these tables doing here?” [<em>Pause, laughter; Deleuze is referring to the circumstances that occurred in the previous session’s discussion</em>]</p><p>On one hand, there is a redoubling: there’s a girl who appears to be taller than him because she’s standing on a table and for that reason she emerges. She makes a speech… which is at times quite violent… and I’m thinking: “Let’s take that route”. And at that point, the tables take on an enormous importance, and they park themselves on all the circles. The tables… And then I turn to see somebody entering the room through the window. That’s a whole other experience, different from the one with the dog. So, all I’m saying is: there is a center of signifiance — and we will see what this consists of – of numerous heterogeneous signs distributed across concentric circles or the spires of a spiral.</p><p>And what else is there? Maybe, to complete the schema, there is something I’m drawing now with a broken line: a <em>line of flight</em>. At the top of the outermost spiral is a line of flight. There may be different ones: those who leave because they’re fed up. The door is more or less blocked. So you pass by the window, I don’t know how… But I’ll draw this broken line of flight, and there I have my first schema.</p><p>You will, I hope, recognize the point where we began, namely, the schema of “a something”, and I am indeed saying of <em>a something</em> because we need to ask ourselves what this “something” is. There’s “a something” that is defined through a kind of matrix or center which produces a sort of circular irradiation, an expanding circularity accompanied by a broken line of flight. So, beginning with this type of matrix, an expanding development occurs, which summons to itself, or regroups or redistributes along its spires signs of a most diverse and heterogeneous nature.</p><p>And then we had another schema. [<em>Pause; Deleuze starts working on a second schema on the board</em>] In this case it was no longer a schema of signifiance. We called it a <em>passional schema</em>, or a <em>schema of subjectivation</em>. And this schema is clearly very different from the previous one since, rather than proceeding from a center through an expanding circular irradiation, it proceeds from a point – <em>a point of subjectivation</em> rather than a center of signifiance. In fact, I might be able to subjectivize myself from any point of departure. A fetishist is subjectivized -and is therefore defined as passional – beginning from a pair of shoes or a single shoe or even just a heel. A lover can be subjectivized beginning from the eyes. We’ve already seen things of that sort, or maybe we haven’t, no matter.</p><p>This point of subjectivation is like the beginning of a straight line. And this straight line is segmentarized. What form does it take? It’s segmentarized through a certain number of successive proceedings. Remember how the two schemas were formally opposed – even before knowing to whom and to what all this referred, even if we’ve already looked at it? But we can put this aside for the moment…</p><p>The formal opposition of the two schemas consists in: irradiating circular expansion beginning from a centre that will distribute the most heterogeneous signs. And, in the second case, a small packet of determined signs fleeing along a straight line that is segmentarized in successive proceedings. So, we oppose the idea of a succession of linear proceedings to that of irradiating circularity. Just as we oppose the idea of a fleeing packet of signs beginning from a point of subjectivation to that of a group of heterogeneous signs subsumed by a center that organizes their distribution, expansion and irradiation.</p><p>So, I would just like to pose three questions, starting from these two schemas. First question. Supposing that here we have two semiotic schemas… for the moment, we still don’t know what a regime of semiotic signs consists in… we are using the words approximately… Suppose that what we have on one hand is a semiotic of signifiance and on the other a passional semiotic or a semiotic of subjectivation: can we make a connection between them, even just on an abstract plane? To be able to do so would be reassuring. Reassuring, because we could say that, in concrete terms, they are continually mixing. In concrete terms, our semiotics of these things are mixed. They borrow a group from a certain system or regime and from another regime.</p><p>Can we link one of these schemas to the other? Clearly, we can. But only at a certain cost, and in certain conditions. I say “clearly we can” because this broken line [<em>at the end of the first schema</em>] is clearly the irradiating and circular system’s line of flight. Isn’t this line fully realized in the passional system? To the point that to link the two schemas, it would be enough to place this line [<em>the straight line, second schema</em>] right here [<em>to the end of the first schema</em>], [<em>Pause</em>] making the center of signifiance descend to this point which now becomes a point of subjectivation. It seems to me that that would work perfectly. I’m simply holding onto the possibility of linking the two schemas as if they were two little trains.</p><p>Second question: What do these two schemas refer to? That we already… Actually, it’s up to you, and this poses the problem of method that we touched upon at the beginning. I would say: they refer to whatever you like. Because each of these two schemas is a <em>multiplicity</em>, even if we talk about a center of signifiance, even if there is an instance of unification. In any case, such an instance functions within a multiplicity. So, we have a multiplicity of signifiance and a passional multiplicity, or multiplicity of subjectivation. Actually, I cannot say that one of these characteristics is more important than the other. They are all on the same plane. I can say that each of these multiplicities has <em>n dimensions</em>. We’ll see what dimensions we find. Here, for example, for the moment – and I insist on this point to convey how simple it is – for the moment, here… as I will try to explain… we have 7 dimensions. If someone tells me “I see 9…” or “Among your 7 some can be reduced…” it doesn’t matter. What matters is that it there is never a fixed number of dimensions. It proceeds by 2, by 3… There are 2, 3, <em>n</em> dimensions, whatever you want.</p><p>Here too, I have to define my schema [<em>the second one</em>] through <em>n</em> dimensions. And this is what defines it. Which is why I don’t need to ask myself beforehand what it refers to. The question isn’t what it refers to; the question is: how many dimensions does this one have [<em>the first schema</em>] compared to the number of dimensions of the other? On this point, if I openly enumerate my dimensions, it doesn’t matter if someone comes along and says: “I would add one”. On the contrary, it’s even better. What’s more annoying is if someone arrives and says: “Here I would remove one or two”. But that’s okay too.</p><p>When we have our number of dimensions, I suppose… it seems highly abstract but, in reality, it’s just a kind of recipe. It really is a recipe. We should write a cookery book! Let’s suppose it has two dimensions. For example, I take three. When I limit or else augment the number of dimensions, when I vary them, it’s only then that I can say what it is they refer to. Before that, it could be anything… a determined multiplicity but of whatever character, an unassignable multiplicity. If you take a precise number of dimensions, then you can ask what it refers to. So, let’s do that. What does this refer to?</p><p>We can call these dimensions the system’s <em>coordinates</em>. In function of the coordinates we take into consideration, we can attribute the schema to something specific. Today I can say all this in abstract terms because the other time, we looked at it concretely. In the schema of signifiance, if I consider certain dimensions, whether or not I state which these are, if I consider certain dimensions, I obtain this particular schema, this multiplicity which refers to a type of delirium. What is this type of delirium? We’ve already seen it: it’s the paranoid delusion and delusion of interpretation, or a delusion of ideas. Why is this?  — We’ve already looked at it and I don’t want to go back to that — Because this delusion is constituted upon a matrix idea, a center of signifiance; it proceeds by way of irradiating circular expansion, and reunites, sutures or distributes the most heterogeneous signs.</p><p>If I consider other coordinates, you will say: “Which others?” We will have to look at them in detail. But please grant me that if I take other coordinates into consideration, the multiplicity’s frame of reference will change. I would say this is important as a way to be able to avoid pointless objections. It will no longer be a paranoid or interpretive delusion, it will be a social formation, the type of formation we may call despotic. If I consider or privilege – because it isn’t simply a question of keeping or jettisoning but also of emphasizing a given dimension – if I consider another dimension of this system, this multiplicity, I would ask, based on the other dimensions, or on this one, is this a system? I mentioned this to you yesterday while trying… no, I mean last week, while trying out different terms, especially since these terms don’t come from Guattari or myself. It’s an idea someone proposed, that someone suggested to us. — And that’s the way to proceed: if people give you ideas, at some point, you’ll give them back in return. — Someone suggested to us certain noticeable differences between the two systems as a function of particular dimensions. I would say that this multiplicity can be called the system or multiplicity of <em>deception</em>.</p><p>Why does one spend one’s time deceiving in this system? It’s not so clear cut. I said some things last week that we will have to go back to and try to develop further. I call that <em>common work</em> when, for example, on Monday I make this multiplicity the multiplicity of paranoid delusion. And we say, okay, you hold onto that. I make the multiplicity of despotic power. And then another person, man or woman, arrives and says: “I’ll make the system of deception out of it…” So, you understand that it wasn’t a schema after all, but a map, a map, a map of variable coordinates. You could turn it upside down, refer it to a particular coordinate, and then it becomes delirium. You could refer it to other coordinates, and it becomes instead a social formation. You could refer it to further sets of coordinates, and it became something of the order of deception and trickery. [<em>Pause</em>] There you are. Each of us can do the same for the other coordinate.</p><p>And we saw that for other one, it was the same: the same method applied. You should never ask at the beginning to whom or what something refers to. Establish your own multiplicity! Calculate it well or badly… and for each case it must be different. Don’t do as Hegel does. Don’t proceed 3 by 3. Don’t proceed 2 by 2. Open yourself to all numbers! Say: if it’s 7, then let it be 7. If 90 then 90. And in this sense, it’s also by following the dimensions you take into account that you assign the multiplicity to this or that.</p><p>And we’ve seen how the multiplicity of passion-subjectivation could have been assigned – depending on the dimensions taken into consideration – to a type of delirium. You see clearly how I’m already lying and playing tricks with everything because, in fact, in a real method, this shouldn’t be same now. I wouldn’t have the right to find two sides, two forms of delirium. Nor would I have the right to find two sides in terms of two social formations. Except that, if I proceed in another way, we would be lost. It would be too difficult for you as it would be for us all. So we approximate, but it goes without saying that all this serves simply to cause the collapse of the pseudo-unity of delirium just like the pseudo-unity of social formations.</p><p>So, we have to pass by way of this point. Therefore, if you consider certain dimensions of the second schema, you will extract a form of delirium, passional delusion or delusion of action, [<em>Pause</em>] and they are not the same thing. I won’t spend much time on this because I’ve already developed it extensively… I just remind you that passional delirium, which is always opposed to, or assumes another figure with respect to paranoid or interpretive delirium, has been given different names throughout the history of psychiatry – all of which more or less refer to Esquirol’s notion of monomania. The monomanias that Esquirol divided into three types: erotic monomania or erotomania, incendiary monomania…</p><p>A student: That’s a good one!</p><p>Deleuze: It’s not bad, not bad… and then homicidal monomania, reasoning monomania. Not bad… They more or less equate to what others would call sticklers. People who stick to procedures. A kind procedural delusion. And Esquirol had already defined monomania as a different form of delusion, not from paranoia, because he didn’t yet know the word, but from mania. There wasn’t an ensemble of things that undermined the exercise of faculties that otherwise remained sane, but a succession of acts, a delusion not of ideas but of acts. [<em>On Esquirol, see the Foucault seminar, session 3 (5 November 1985), and on psychiatry of the era, see</em> A Thousand Plateaus_, pp. 119-120_] And this, particularly in Germany, was called a <em>querulous delusion.</em> And this is where the legal procedural aspect came in. It was a delusion of querulants. They start a proceeding that arrives at its conclusion and then they embark upon a second and then a third and so on… Other psychiatrists would call them grievance delusions. And yet others would refer to them as passional delusions. And they were grouped into three main forms: jealousy, erotomania and redress.</p><p>So if you consider certain coordinates of the second multiplicity you will have, for example, a delirious formation: the group of passional delusions. While if you consider other or more coordinates, you will have – it’s what we touched upon, perhaps rather hurriedly, and it will still have to be proved — you will have something quite strange, no longer the despotic formation but something quite different we will have to find a name for this but maybe we will just look for a general name. Since we’re talking about attributions and without seeking to be too symmetrical, we could call it the history of the Jewish People. [<em>Pause</em>]</p><p>But to what extent? Quite generally, since we tried to get an idea of this the last time, and naturally the history of the Jewish People raises a number of other questions. It’s not by chance; I’m really glad that I first made the connection, the Jewish people with the exodus literally going off on a tangent from a despotic system, the system of the Pharaohs. [<em>Pause</em>] Everything happens as if they took upon their shoulders, and inserted themselves into, the line of flight…  [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [2:53:50]</p><p>[<em>While several details seem to suggest that what follows occurs in an entirely different session – Deleuze now wearing a dark coat (that he removes at the end of this section) and a hat – the following 36 minutes is the result of an interruption in the work in progress, with the same schemas on the board evident in the subsequent part. Since this segment opens in mid-discussion, it is important to explain the substance of the debate which is revealed only gradually. Apparently during a break in the filming, a woman student made some unclear accusation to Deleuze concerning a “stolen text”, and Deleuze stated his refusal to continue and even threatened to leave, hence the coat and hat. Following this unrecorded part, the debate unfolds on two tracks, on one hand, on what basis could or should the assembled class members exclude the student in question, and on the other hand, if the material that Deleuze developed earlier – concerning despotic power, etc. – might prevent any such move.

[<em>Diverse noises, pause; the first student is visibly waiting</em>]</p><p>The first student: I’m not saying that we don’t want to do it [<em>presumably, exclude the woman student in question</em>]; it’s that we can’t; we can’t because the mode of repressive power is impossible to… it’s everywhere. It can’t work, it’s unfeasible. I mean, that here, in this theatre where we are, we … there are…</p><p>Another student: But we’re not in a theater! We’re not in a theater!</p><p>The first student: We cannot…</p><p>The previous student: [<em>Indistinct comment</em>]</p><p>The first student: It’s truly impossible! How can it be done? [<em>Diverse voices, including the first woman student’s</em>] What would we have to eliminate? By what means… [<em>Indistinct comment</em>]</p><p>Another student [<em>Philippe</em>]: I have a proposal to make. In my view, we’re all being cowards. I’m doing something I’ve never done before in my life, and I take responsibility for it. I’m throwing you out! [<em>Pause</em>] I’ve never done anything like this in my life. [<em>He starts walking towards the students standing near the door; diverse voices, noises</em>] What you’re doing is completely unacceptable.</p><p>The first student: No it’s not, I’m saying…</p><p>The second student (<em>Philippe</em>]: I’ve never done this before.</p><p>Another woman student: You don’t have the right to do that.</p><p>The second student [<em>Philippe</em>]: Otherwise, every Tuesday, we’re the ones who are getting thrown out. Do you want it to be the same every day? And just because we’re trying not to be repressive, so everyone lets themselves get aggressed. For us, that makes us… [<em>Indistinct comment; diverse voices; Deleuze becomes visible in his usual seat, wearing a hat</em>]</p><p>Guattari: Philippe! Oh! Philippe! [<em>Diverse noises, voices</em>]</p><p>Eric: Nobody is taking responsibility in this classroom!</p><p>Guattari: Philippe! Listen to me a second!</p><p>Deleuze: Philippe, don’t touch her! Don’t touch her!</p><p>A woman student: He has to calm down!</p><p>Guattari: He is calm. He has the same right to be as sane as you.</p><p>The first student: The problem is that this is nonetheless an interesting place to be. Even if it gets upset, even when it’s upset, there is an effect created, and here we produce a perfect outcome. It really is an extraordinary example.</p><p>Another student: It’s making a straight line on the circle. [<em>Reference to Deleuze’s two schema’s earlier</em>]</p><p>The first student: Before, we were discussing it but now we’re no longer doing so. We’re just suffering it. What’s at stake is something completely different. It’s not a question of analysis. It’s about what we’re living, you understand? It’s an unimaginable mode; I mean that there isn’t a problem of exclusion. We can’t exclude anyone.</p><p>Guattari: Giovanni Jervis talks about these things on the radio all the time. They discuss boring stuff like the situation in Italy, and then there’s someone talking about an amazing thing, like all these marvelous things that Éric mentions even if they’re seemingly off topic. So, you’re saying we’re condemned to cut off any intervention like that, just to have a bit of logical coherence. Jervis has spoken about this problem. What is this “tolerance” of ours towards certain forms of discourse, where we can spend an entire lesson arguing with someone? It’s possible, it can be done… it would be great to be able to spend a couple of hours talking to Eric and his woman friend who must be dying of anguish right now. Fine.</p><p>But since our goal is to speak with a certain logical coherence about a series of connected ideas, we can’t accept it. We are prisoners of a certain representation of “spontaneism”, of a certain freedom of expression, a kind of absence of constraints that comes back to assault us… as though we were walking towards the riot police carrying bunches of flowers as they attack us. It’s completely stupid when you think about it…</p><p>A student: We’ve had it up to here with therapy!</p><p>Guattari: Therapy? It’s not a question of therapy. If we say: “One day we’re going to clear things up with our friend here, what happened with Deleuze? What occurred? Why did she talk about stolen texts?” Yes, okay, fine. We’ll come to an agreement there. But if we accept that anyone can walk in here and throw boiling oil on us, pile on a load of crap with all that stuff, we can’t function at all   anymore anywhere, we’re prisoners. Unlike Philippe, I don’t think we can find a solution by crucifying ourselves with violence. But we have to confront the problem. We are ourselves… we secrete this reaction. We lay ourselves open to this reaction.</p><p>The first student: Does one have to say about what you just said that…</p><p>Eric (<em>interrupting, screaming throughout his interventions</em>): You’re making an analysis of the institution. You’re describing how it functions. And on that point, we’d do better to reread… uh, [Bronislaw] Malinowski…</p><p>Guattari: Malinowski or [Vladimir] Mayakovsky?</p><p>Eric: You embody the institution as a professor!</p><p>A student: [<em>Inaudible comment due to the screaming</em>]</p><p>Eric: Deleuze…. [<em>To the student</em>] That’s not the question… I’m trying to say something, idiot! There’s always… I’m speaking to her… there’s always a difference between what I say and what I live. And at Vincennes, there is always a difference between what we say and what we live.</p><p>Guattari: Eric, Eric!</p><p>Eric: And this is what I call contradiction!</p><p>Guattari: Eric, do you want Deleuze to leave Vincennes for good?</p><p>Eric: No!</p><p>Guattari: That’s what you want!</p><p>Eric: No it’s not!</p><p>Guattari: So why are you behaving constantly like an idiot?</p><p>Eric: [<em>Indistinct comment at start</em>] … I’m saying that you embody the institution!</p><p>Guattari: You’re going to succeed. That’s what’s going to happen. Is that what you want?</p><p>Eric: No, I have nothing to do with this business.</p><p>Guattari: Yes, you do, because you’re creating a shit storm (<em>tu fous de la merde</em>).</p><p>Eric: No, I’m not! [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [2:59:15]</p><p>… Guattari: So can we continue now?</p><p>The first student: Yes, well, but I can’t accept this. I mean, I can’t accept that we go on analyzing a model in this way. We can’t build a discourse on this model, saying: “Let’s analyze it and see what we find,” all that. No, … [<em>He tries to speak while Guattari answers</em>]</p><p>Guattari: Then we won’t do anything. There’ll be nothing to do either next week or the following week. So it’s now that we must decide. [<em>Silence, pause</em>]</p><p>The first student: I mean that…</p><p>Guattari: I’m not talking about Deleuze. He can say what he wants, but I can’t go on like this.</p><p>The first student: It’s not possible! Anyway, the proof is right there, that there are lines everywhere, everyone’s always arguing all the time, no one is getting along, we can’t understand anything about anything. And that explains everything.</p><p>Another student: That’s not true! I understand perfectly well.</p><p>The first student: No, we don’t understand anything…</p><p>Another student (<em>Robert Albouker</em>): I don’t give a shit about what he says. That doesn’t interest me at all, at all, at all. And you know why? It’s because [<em>indistinct words</em>] I am quite pleased, but all the [<em>indistinct words</em>] in this matter doesn’t interest me.</p><p>A student: If we raise the question of exclusion, we have to understand how it happens, if there are any rules.</p><p>Another student (<em>Robert Albouker</em>): There are no rules. That’s why we’re all here…</p><p>The first student: There aren’t any. That’s just the point. There aren’t. And if there aren’t, what are we supposed to do? And here I’m following all the lines. We’ll never get out of it.</p><p>A woman student: No, no, I don’t see that.</p><p>Another student (<em>Robert Albouker</em>):  Of course we will. We do it every morning, that functions every day, every single goddamned day, like fools, at work, at school. It works. And we even have to smile about it.</p><p>Another student: Oh, no, no, no…</p><p>The preceding student (<em>Robert Albouker</em>): What do you mean “no”? Look at me, I’m here!</p><p>The first student: At the Elysée asylum, that works as well…</p><p>The second student (<em>Philippe</em>): I propose we vote… Does the course continue as is, that is, next week or does it not continue? We have to take responsibility and decide once and for all whether to exclude this girl who’s been disrupting the lesson and who will continue to do so every Tuesday until we’re left with nothing, we have to accept our responsibility!</p><p>A woman student (<em>whose voice and protests are audible in the preceding student’s statement</em>): No, that’s not true! [<em>Pause, diverse voices, all indistinct</em>]</p><p>The first student: We have Deleuze here, and this question concerns Deleuze and her before it concerns us, that is, there’s something going on there [<em>he makes a gesture linking Deleuze and a woman student</em>]. It’s not at all… I mean, even if we vote, Deleuze can always say, “No, she ‘s here, she makes it impossible for me,” I don’t know. [<em>Deleuze sits listening in silence</em>] If he can work it out with her, I don’t know… it’s something between Deleuze and her.</p><p>The second student (<em>Philippe</em>): No, it’s not just between Deleuze and her. It concerns all of us and her.</p><p>The first student: Not at all! Not at all!</p><p>Guattari: We’re reaching a level of idiocy now that’s unbelievable! [<em>Diverse voices, brouhaha</em>] We’ve descended to the state of stupid cattle, [<em>Pause, reactions</em>] stupid cattle pulling wagons into the camps. [<em>Pause</em>]</p><p>Deleuze: I would just like to say a couple of things now… I awake from my catatonic state, and I would say…</p><p>A woman student: But Guattari already…</p><p>Several students: Shut up!</p><p>Deleuze: [3:02:17] I’m asking two questions. Firstly, what are we doing here? We are quite modest. So what are we doing here that is of so bizarre in nature that it triggers a certain type of aggression? [<em>Pause</em>] We’ve seen a lot of examples. Today’s is one that seems particularly painful. Second question: what is it that makes us – and maybe with some reasons, though I won’t say these are good reasons – what it is that makes us so defenseless when confronted with these acts of aggression? In a sense, it can be useful to learn something from the outside. What we’re doing here must not disturb anywhere; I don’t know, I’m not saying “anyone”. But suddenly we are disarmed in the sense that it becomes very easy for a single person to create havoc in the classroom, considering that the balance of power normally favors the individual, unless he or she happens to be in a classroom with a whole army, a security team available.</p><p>Personally speaking, I feel a bit lost today. And it interests me so little that I can say my only strength – and here I’m not speaking on behalf of the rest of the class – my only strength is an extreme obstinacy. Three Tuesdays would be sufficient to accomplish a very simple thing: completely destroy the work we’ve done. I’ll come back every Tuesday. I don’t give a shit; I don’t give a shit. [<em>Je m’en fous</em>]</p><p>There are two elements that come together in this affair. This girl arrives. She has a certain relationship with all of us in that she prevents us from doing what we’re trying to do. And as you said, she obviously has a certain rapport with me. Of which I understand nothing. I only know — and this is no secret because the same problem has occurred in other situations — I get calls at night when I would normally be sleeping. Silence on the other end of the line, or insults or obscenities… Usually very confused. They always mistake me for someone else.</p><p>It’s very similar in a way. In the case of the phone calls, as Félix says, what should we do when people like that are so obstinate? They call you ten, twenty times in a row. I pick up the phone, and I hear noises. What should we do? One day, we might even find someone on our doorstep, standing there saying “I want to see you!” What do we do then. Call the police? Don’t call the police? What do you do after three months of this? It’s strange how it always happens to the same people. Lacan is lucky in this sense. He would have resolved the problem in two seconds.</p><p>But in my view, it’s a kind of strength, nothing exceptional, but it’s a strength that we are so, so… even if now we might be forced to change tack… though not much. What is it that makes us so defenseless faced with someone who comes in here saying: “You stole that from me!”? The same way I’m defenseless when they call me up at night. What is it that produces this? I would almost say, at the risk of sounding vain, I would almost say that it’s the novelty… a certain novelty in what we’re doing. It’s a certain novelty in what we’re doing here that permits someone to turn up…</p><p>I think of a recent book that I find quite repellent where they refer to us as “the current trend”. The current trend… That’s a bit exaggerated because — and I stress that Lacan has nothing to do with it — but it’s a bunch of Lacanians, Lacanian Marxists, as Eric would say, who speak of us as “the current trend.” But to be frank… if there is an organized “current trend”, it’s not us. We are nothing. We just work in our little corner.</p><p>Once again, what can we summon by way of response if they want to prevent us from working? I’d like to imagine some responses we could give. I would say it’s partly the nature of what we are doing here that renders us so defenseless, and yet at the same time, I consider this a means of defense. Therefore, I’m not going to leave. I was wrong to say that I would leave… I’m not going. I’ll just wait until you leave. That’s all. And then if this goes on much longer, and you stay, then probably I will end up leaving. There we are. [<em>Pause</em>] But I think the only way to resist is to stay on the defensive when facing cases like this. Perhaps we ought to find a better solution, we might find a better solution, but for the moment I can’t think of one. So, now I slide back into my catatonic state…</p><p>A student: I think she left! [<em>Pause</em>]</p><p>Another student: Actually, she left ten minutes before all this [<em>unclear word; then to Deleuze</em>] You hadn’t seen her face before? [<em>Pause, Deleuze makes no response</em>] What makes you think you didn’t start all this? I’m not accusing you.</p><p>Deleuze: Ah yes!</p><p>The student: I’m not accusing you, ok? [<em>Pause</em>]</p><p>Deleuze: I’m afraid of myself!</p><p>Another student: I’ve never saw her face at all… [<em>Pause, several comments from other students</em>]</p><p>Deleuze: Oh yes, she was here last year. [<em>Pause</em>] Has she gone? [<em>Deleuze stands up</em>]</p><p>Another student: Well, yes she has.</p><p>Deleuze: Really? [<em>Pause, laughter; Deleuze slowly takes off the hat and coat he has worn throughout the discussion, that he no doubt put on when he was planning to leave; noises of chairs while he prepares</em>] … [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [3:10:02]</p><p>… Deleuze: One can always speak through dualisms. In the end, it’s the easiest, the most convenient way. Once again, the base 2 binary system is the most convenient. Parenthetically, that’s what computer scientists are always telling us. Computer scientists, who always work through binarisms, say they do it because, from the computer’s point of view, it’s the easiest method. For a computer, we know, base 2 is the easiest way. [<em>Pause</em>] So much the better, we say, since considering what we have done up to now, in the way we’ve considered the question, we’ve learned something.</p><p>When we spoke about the face, we thought we’d discovered that binarisms, the establishing of dichotomies and binary rapports, the whole aggregate of dualisms, had served us well for reasons that were far from mere convenience. They were connected to the exercise of a certain type of power, and there were forms of power that couldn’t tolerate the polyvocality of bodies and had to produce face, and that in producing face, established major binarisms, given that the face is caught up in binary relationships. And beginning from this, the signifying elements were distributed according to a series of dichotomies.</p><p>We also saw how an exercise of power is something that completely defines the dominant language and that profoundly defines the way that language and words are used. As a result, it’s not a question of saying: “I will invent a language without dualisms.” There’s only one thing at stake here: not only are dualisms convenient but language itself as a form of expression of a particular power <em>imposes</em> dualisms. As a result, our only response, both in speaking and writing, is to continually open a kind of passage <em>between</em> dualisms. And each time we make a dualism collapse – a dualism is like a piece of furniture, it’s something that is always being moved around… – we’re inevitably going to run into another one and so we’ll have to open up a new passage in that dualism. And each time we’ll try to do so.</p><p>As a result, of course I am saying there are two forms of delirium on each side. It goes without saying that we will try to open up a passageway between these two forms, we will try to arrive at something that will obviously no longer deserve to be called either reason or delirium, nor one type of delusion or another. However, we’re not going to be able to open this passageway using a predetermined method and every time we will have to regain the multiplicities, passing by way of these dualisms.</p><p>So as I can only respond like that, I am saying, let’s try to look for the dimensions, the coordinates of the first system that we call <em>signifiance</em> and which, based on the coordinates contained therein, will be located both at the level of a delirium and of a social formation, a system, for example, a system of deception.</p><p>So the first coordinate — I number them because there are many and this will help us to orient ourselves — the first coordinate, to return to my example of signs, which in the meantime has become more complex as we have added others, is a system in which a sign refers to other signs <em>ad infinitum</em>. There’s a whole network of signs that are completely heterogeneous. [<em>Pause</em>] Everything is captured.</p><p>What does it mean when we say that a sign refers to another sign? After all this emotion, we have to let loose… The sign refers to another sign. It means at least that some things can no longer happen. When a sign refers to another sign of which I know nothing in advance, a kind of atmosphere has already been born, an <em>atmospherization</em>, as I said before. What do we understand here? The sign refers to another sign. I should say that in our method we should never practice free association of ideas. What we have to do is produce redundancy. We have to make resonate not words but bits of phrases [<em>Pause</em>] until a kind of jump occurs. The sign refers to another sign. We feel that we’re not going to get anything worthwhile out of that. We can say, yes it’s true but it leaves us in an impasse… No matter what sign refers to no matter what sign. This is the system of signifiance. Nothing to be gleaned there, we’re saying.</p><p>Then suddenly a glimmer of light appears. If the sign refers to another sign, it means at least that it doesn’t refer to something else. And what would this something else be? I can conceive… maybe it will help us get out of these dualisms. I can conceive of a sign that refers to something other than another sign. A sign can refer to a state of things. An extremely variable state of things. For example, smoke is a sign of fire. Of course, fire could be just another sign, and then we fall back into the same trap. But fire can also be considered a state of things.</p><p>“A sign refers to a state of things” is a very different proposition to “a sign refers to another sign.” A painting, a corporeal painting on the body of a member of a tribe, appears to refer to a very particular state of things. It’s a code that refers to a territoriality. Are all states of things of this nature? Animals, it’s well known that animals emit signs. For example, excrement, which equates to states of things, is often used by animals as signs. Signs of what? Signs of the limits of their territory. The sign may therefore refer to a state of things that, generally speaking — I don’t have time right now to ask whether or not every state of things is a territoriality — but I’ll just say that a sign can refer to a state of things that can, generally speaking, be reduced to a territoriality. [<em>Pause</em>]</p><p>But I see something else. The sign may also no longer refer to a state of things that it designates. It may refer to a signified, as they say, to something that it signifies and which is not of the same nature as a state of things. So, while I say that the sign refers to a state of things, that is to a territoriality, generally what the sign signifies is not a state of things but rather a concept. The sign signifies a concept. We’re not demanding… We’re not looking for anything extraordinary here. So, it signifies a concept. We can in some way say that it no longer <em>refers</em> to a territoriality, but that it <em>leads</em> to a kind of reterritorialization, a reterritorialization that is in this case spiritual or mental. [<em>Pause</em>]</p><p>So there we have it. We’ve opened our passage. What is the sign that refers to another sign, <em>ad infinitum</em>, a sign that refers to a sign that refers to a sign that refers to a sign… to the point that in the end one can no longer even call it a sign, but rather an infinite or unlimited realm of signifiance, an infinite or unlimited realm of signifiance which is precisely the state of a sign that refers to any sign whatsoever? So I can say that the sign that refers to another sign, insofar as it refers to another sign, is a deterritorialized sign [<em>Pause</em>]. No longer referring to a state of things and not yet referring to a signified, it is caught up in the moment of its own deterritorialization.</p><p>Suddenly we can say, at the risk of including everything in what we’re discussing, there’s a famous author, Peirce, who proposed a terminology that had a certain success: <em>index</em>, <em>icon</em>, <em>symbol</em>. We don’t really care what he meant by this. That’s not our business. We just imagine that we might be able to make use of these terms. We will say that the <em>index</em> is the sign insofar as it refers to a territoriality whereas the <em>icon</em> is the sign insofar as it leads to a reterritorialization, and the <em>symbol</em> is the sign insofar as it is deterritorialized, that is, the sign that refers to another sign.</p><p>But how can there be a network in which any sign can refer to any other sign? Once again, at this level there are no longer different states of things. Or, as is often said, there are no longer referents. Nor are there signifieds. Quite simply, the sign becomes a signifier when it refers to another sign <em>ad infinitum</em>. This status of the sign is rather bizarre. What is implied by this network of signs become signifiers? It becomes signifiers precisely by the fact that they refer to another sign <em>ad infinitum</em>.</p><p>In what conditions does such a network become possible? There isn’t yet a given signified, rather this network of signs is established on a sort of <em>continuum</em>, a sliding continuum, a slippery continuum. Which means that all possible contents, all signifieds are fused in a kind of atmospheric continuum… [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [3:24:10]</p><p>A kind of amorphous, slippery, revolting continuum… like quicksand. A point, a sign… takes up another sign. Everything occurs as though the continuum had slid. As a result, these signs don’t even require the links of free association. Free association is a complete idiocy. There’s no need. They are drawn towards one another by the slow sliding of the continuum. Once again, there is nothing that associates the dog and the mask. [<em>Reference to the example given toward the beginning of the session</em>] There is just a movement of muddy terrain, of sticky terrain. It’s not surprising. Both paranoid delusion and the despotic formation are traversed by terror. [<em>Pause</em>] And that’s the first characteristic. I have to go faster.</p><p>Second characteristic… The first, as we said, is simply the reference from sign to sign that implies a deterritorialization of the sign and supposes an amorphous, sliding continuum. Second characteristic: the circularity of the system. Indeed one of the most well-known and celebrated representatives of the signifying system, Lacan, says, for example, of the signifying sign that it is “at the risk of a circular return”.  Why “at the risk of a circular return”? You see the signifying chain that is constituted on the amorphous network. — He doesn’t present its constitution in this way, but it’s of no importance –“at the risk of a circular return”, in fact, redundancy already belongs to the system, signifying redundancy, each sign passing into another sign. The dog has become this. It has become. What does it mean that it has become another thing? It means that a slow slippage of the terrain has occurred, causing it to pass into something else. It’s not a happy world. Nor will this be a happy world. [<em>Deleuze indicates the second schéma</em>] To find gay, happy worlds we’ll have to go off on a tangent… “At the risk of circular return”, the sign that passes into another sign, that will pass again on its own account… This impression of eternal return forms part of this sticky atmosphere, the impression of the already lived. A sad impression… [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [3:27:36]</p><p>… When Nietzsche has this impression he leaps with joy, but not for long. He’s dragged under by the quicksand. He trips up in his dance. If nothing else, he was happy for an instant. That’s already something.</p><p>Therefore, what we have is a kind of redundancy – not only of the sign with another sign but of the sign with itself. The sign doesn’t enter into relation with another sign in the sliding continuum without entering into relation with itself as that which will always make its return. This is what it is to feel the sign of the despot. The whole of the despot is already there. But we haven’t seen it yet. So that’s the second characteristic. Sorry if I have to rush on, but otherwise we’ll never get finished.</p><p>Third dimension. If I keep to my schema and let it guide me… I can say that I’ve roughly accounted for the circularity of the system. But why are there several circles? Why all these spires of the spiral? Why these distinct circles? This is very important for us. Why? Because from one circle to another – and you see how the signs are distributed on these distinct circles… Once more I go back to the example we encountered in the last lesson. With the atmosphere there was that day in this room, the signs weren’t at all on the same circle. We could always say that I was the one who brought it in with me, but I wouldn’t be happy with that, since it implies an operation of redoubling that would put us in mind of certain notions…</p><p>A student: But wasn’t it more like the second figure?</p><p>Deleuze: You think so?</p><p>The student: Yes. [<em>Pause, laughter; Deleuze pauses to consider this</em>]</p><p>Deleuze: The various signs didn’t arise on the same spires or the same circles… The dog, I repeat, was part of the outermost circle. To be specific, insofar as it was a sign pertaining to this formation, it was a deterritorialized dog. It didn’t have its territoriality here. It was a deterritorialized dog. Friendly enough but deterritorialized all the same… [<em>Tape</em> <em>interrupted</em>] [3:30:42]</p><p>… In this system of signifiance [<em>Deleuze indicates the first schema</em>], one never ceases… you see how I’m still developing my first point, even if we’re at the third. I’m still developing the first point. Because the sign refers to any other sign, one never ceases to jump from one circle to another. An example is the girl [<em>He refers to the woman who caused the preceding lengthy discussion</em>] She obviously had an account to settle with me. There… a whole private scene was in play, although I had never done anything to her. And she for her part had a public intervention to make. She was making a jump. I think that’s why Félix said – for which someone accused him of being a psychiatrist – that’s why Felix said: She feels anguished. She too… She makes us feel anguished, but she feels it too. She was jumping from one circle to another.</p><p>It’s strange… Because in the system – we still haven’t spoken about the despot, but you can feel he’s always there in the background. In what form? There are his two eyes – in the system you have regulated jumps, ones that are tolerated and others that are forbidden. Regulated jumps are when one can pass, I suppose, from a certain private event to a certain social situation. In other cases, this kind of jump is not permitted. Think for example of the time when military men who were officers didn’t have the right to divorce. What does that mean? If I take a circle which I nominate completely at random, considering I have no particular reason for it to be here or there. It varies… it can be extremely variable. Everything depends on the point of reference. If you take the family home as the center of signifiance, the private circle will be the closest to the hearth. If you take the State apparatus as your center the private circle will be very extrinsic. So we have to put everything into play. To respond to your question, it explodes in every direction.</p><p>So, anyway, I named it very randomly. Let’s imagine that <em>this</em> is the circle of private signs, and <em>this</em> is the circle of public signs. Private event: divorce. The jump is forbidden. The officer is stripped of his rank. It’s a jump you can’t make. You cannot be both an officer and divorced. Of course, things have changed since then… But in what way have they changed? Which jumps are still not tolerated? Which ones?</p><p>What is it that the Greeks call <em>hybris</em>? [<em>Deleuze writes it on the board</em>] You recall that in Greek tragedy, you have two elements: firstly, there’s the theme of the gods who give a <em>lot</em> to each, who assign lots, as in a lottery; and then you have the man of <em>hybris</em>, who is someone who jumps too far and who overleaps his lot. He has literally jumped too far when prey to a demon. In general, the Greek hero is possessed by <em>hybris</em>, a word usually translated as “outrageousness”. Having failed to measure his jump, he attempts a forbidden jump.</p><p>Then there are jumps that are well regulated, for example, when a boy from good family goes to study at the <em>Polytéchnique</em>… this is allowed… There’s a whole system of regulations. One particular example is found in very ancient despotic formations in South America, where passages between private and public signs are strictly regulated, for example between the event of a woman who betrays her husband and the right the husband has to withdraw to the outskirts of the village to pray for a calamity to descend upon the whole village, until such time as purification rites have been performed. Here we have a typical regulation of the jump: a woman betrays her husband and the husband rebounds on a given circle of signifiance to which he has the right. On another circle, he moves to the outskirts of the village and prays to the gods to wipe out all the villagers. So you sense all this… It’s again the sliding continuum that permits him to do so.</p><p>But at the same time, there are forbidden jumps, the ones we’re not supposed to make. This is why I say our schema works by means of a multiplicity of circles. But there’s no need to say where this multiplicity of circles derives from. It’s simple… We have the answer in our last two points. The multiplicity of my circles derives from the following: the sign that refers to another sign, whether on the same circle or on another, is the deterritorialized state of the sign. And I will try to explain to you why this is. It’s the sign in its deterritorialization. Otherwise, it refers to something other than a sign.</p><p>However, deterritorialization is never a state. It’s a movement. Now, in function of their origin, in function of the territoriality from which they derive… signs do not have the same speed, nor the same nature of deterritorialization. As a result, it’s inevitable that there isn’t a single circle but rather spires of a spiral. These spires or different circles are distinguished according to their speed and to the nature of deterritorialization of the signs that are assigned to each circle or spire. It seems complicated, but actually it’s quite simple. One has to just let oneself go.</p><p>Good. Here we already have three coordinates. First coordinate: the sign referring to another sign <em>ad infinitum</em>. This is the sign’s signifiance and state of deterritorialization. Second coordinate: the system is circular, and necessarily so. Third coordinate: it involves a plurality of distinct circles or spires of a spiral, with both regulated jumps from one circle to the other and also forbidden jumps between circles. In a certain sense, Oedipus, the despot… it sometimes happens that the despot himself makes the forbidden jump. And in <em>Oedipus,</em> there’s a famous line, when Oedipus asks in relation to his own case: “Which demon has leapt the longest leap?” That is to say, which demon led me to make the forbidden jump? A jump in the sense of… [<em>Deleuze makes a jumping gesture with his hands, but does not finish the sentence</em>]</p><p>Fourth coordinate: it’s not enough that we have several circles. Each time we add a dimension. In the second coordinate, we obtained the idea of the circle, and in the third, the plurality of circles. But we don’t yet have a sufficient number of dimensions. Fourth coordinate or dimension: we need something that assures the expansion of the circles, that assures their perpetual expansion. What prevents the signifying regime from dying of a sort of <em>entropy</em>, as physicists would say? What prevents the entropy of the system from growing to the point that everything is annulled in the indeterminate and anonymous continuum? This continuum is very dangerous because it is at the same time the quicksand that carries the sign to another sign and also what rises up and risks drowning everything in an atmospheric continuity where one can no longer distinguish anything. At which point the whole system would suffocate.</p><p>Therefore, something is required to continually recharge the circles. To recharge the signs on every circle. Something is required to be able to assure the circles’ expansion. What assures it, therefore, is the fact that all at once, in another dimension that I can’t even represent, every sign, or group of signs — it hardly matters — will be made to correspond to a signified. We are no longer in the domain of signifiance, we are in the domain of what we could call <em>interpretation</em>. To interpret means to make a sign or a group of signs, presumed to be signifiers, refer to a signified.</p><p>It’s not the same situation we had in the first dimension where the only signified was the amorphous anonymous, atmospheric continuum itself. Now, on the contrary, the continuum is cut, in such a way as to make every group of signs correspond to a signified. Here we no longer have the figure of the despot but that of his accomplice, the interpreter, the diviner. The diviner will interpret the signs which is to say he will make them correspond to a given signified.</p><p>Fine, but how does that suffice to recharge the system as a whole? I’m going even faster now! It’s not a modern discovery to say that no interpretation ever arrives at an ultimate <em>interpreted.</em> What the diviners interpret are always other interpretations. The diviner emits signs… but what do they interpret? The signs of the goddess <em>ad infinitum</em>. In other words, if someone asked us what is the ultimate signified, we would have to respond: the signifier. And I’m not the one making this up. All the champions of the signifier agree on this point. Which is the best interpretation? They also say it or perform it: it’s silence.</p><p>This is what psychoanalysts have discovered: no longer to interpret but to keep silent. And it’s this silence of the analyst that gives the patient something to interpret. Each time the interpretation, since it can do no more than replace another interpretation, recharges the signifier and refuels the sign with signifiance… And so here we have a first way to defeat the entropy of the system. It’s the diviner, which is to say the man with the delusion of interpretation, who has the task of recharging the entropy of the system with signifiance.</p><p>As a result, at the extreme, parenthetically, what we have is a way to distinguish paranoia and interpretation. Though they are in the same group, they are not the same thing. This means that since the signified continuously refers to the signifier, and is in the last instance, the signifier itself, the interpretation that assigns the signified to a group of signs always recharges signifiance. Thus the machine of signifiance will constantly be recharged from within.</p><p>So we can say that the two maladies, because that’s what they are, the two maladies of humanity are finally signifiance and interpretation.

So, you understand that, beginning from this first dimension of the system, other dimensions multiply. … I will just add that the function of faciality, of the face, cannot be the same here. … In what way is this also the system of deception? It is a paranoid delusion, a delusion of interpretation, both a social and a despotic formation, almost a practical exercise, based on the characteristic I proposed to you… You might want to add others, combine them, subtract, underline some, and what you will obtain is a either a delusion in hospital, a social formation, a system of groups, of individuals, a system that we proposed to call “system of deception.” Why? Because everything it contains is deception. Everything is deception, trickery, at every level. In the centre, you have the face of the despot. The despot’s face, this type of mask that priests manipulate when necessary, making it speak. The inert despot and so on… Therefore, you have deception at the centre of signifiance, and deception in interpretation.</p></blockquote><p><em>The successive segments of this same session show the previous discussion regarding modes of signifying as related to faciality with Deleuze in the process of creating a multidimensional multiplicity, currently the fifth dimension. This binary relationship is, in fact, the movement from sign to sign, and Deleuze cites a tale about the despotic formation from Luc de Heusch [<em>T__he Drunken King, Or the Origin of the State;</em> <em>Le roi ivre ou l’origine de l’État</em> <em>(Paris: Gallimard, 1972)],</em> a myth of the Bantu people, thereby providing an example of how the face serves to establish the Signifier or also is the form of reterritorialization proper to the Signifier. Shifting to a sixth dimension, Deleuze asserts that the paranoid or despotic system needs to block lines of flight from escaping the circular system, and he refers to Foucault’s <em>Discipline and Punish</em> regarding the tortured man who above all loses his face, i.e., through his expulsion. Thus, the sixth dimension is the presence of a line of flight with negative value, and hence everything that threatens this system’s signifiance is cast out. With the six dimensions of the paranoid or despotic system in place (two dimensions during this session), Deleuze proposes to link this schema to the second figure, the one with successive linear steps. In contrast to the despotic formation’s system of deception, the passional functions entirely differently, with a packet of signs fleeing along the segmented line. Deleuze insists that so-called “primitive” semiotics as well as nomadic semiotics do not equate with either of the schemas he has outlined, thus referring to the mix of semiotics that has occurred. To Georges Comtesse’s challenge to Deleuze’s model of the face-substance center, Deleuze reacts with considerable scorn since Comtesse has simply changed the terms, all the more evident when he agrees with each of Deleuze’s points. When Comtesse attempts to distinguish his position further, Deleuze simply agrees with him, and the film ends with Comtesse holding forth alone at the back of the classroom with Deleuze listening calmly and smiling.</em></p><p><strong><em>Il Senso in Meno,</em></strong> <strong>Part 9 –</strong> <strong>Faciality as the substance of the Signifier, the Two Scapegoats and the Line of Flight</strong></p><p><strong>Translated by Graeme Thomson and Silvia Maglioni; revised translation, Charles J.

It’s no longer the redundancy of a sign with respect to another sign, nor of the sign in relation to itself, it is redundancy in its pure state. The Signifier in its pure state is <em>fort da.</em> The bobbin game. That one chews on… Why does one chew on it? Because the Signifier in its pure state is so pure that we no longer even know what it is, whether it’s in its place when it’s not, or not in its place when it is. Very good… perfect.</p><p>Now that we know something about it, we can go faster. We saw this on other occasions, that the Signifier wouldn’t be anything if it didn’t have a substance to stabilize it. And this substance is faciality. This substance is the black hole of the eyes on the white wall. And if the Signifier can establish itself and establish its dichotomies and establish its signs and organize them in binary relationships where the sign refers to another sign, it is only in function of the organization made possible by faciality. And faciality is precisely the mainstay of the Signifier, otherwise there wouldn’t be one.</p><p>Which is why the champions of the Signifier hide their faces. No, they don’t hide their faces exactly, but they appear to say that the Signifier has no real need of their face. But at night they laugh… They’re impostors. Who laugh while looking at themselves in the mirror, perfectly aware that by virtue…</p><p>[<em>Interruption by a student</em>]</p><p>A woman student: [<em>Inaudible comment</em>]</p><p>Deleuze (<em>laughing</em>): Yes, that arrives quite well… [since they know well] that without the face the Signifier would simply merge with the amorphous continuum.</p><p>Therefore, the black hole – white wall system is constitutive of the Signifier and of its operations on signs, which are the establishing of binarisms, binary relationships, dichotomies. And what I call dichotomy is this very movement. I’m just making the gesture [<em>points to the blackboard</em>] to go faster… What I call binary relationship is this movement, the relation of sign to sign, with the dichotomy being rooted in the Signifier. Here we have the binary distribution of signs.</p><p>We’re going really quickly now. So, at this level, once again, there’s no secret. In the despotic formation or the paranoid regime, you will never find secrets, only publicity. The despot says: “Here is my face, I won’t hide my face.” And I’ve already quoted to you from a text that I find very interesting in this regard. I don’t have time to quote it again in its entirety… it’s on pages 20-25 of a book by Luc de Heusch, <em>The Drunken King, Or the Origin of the State</em> [Le roi ivre ou l’origine de l’État <em>(Paris: Gallimard, 1972); on this specific example, see</em> A Thousand Plateaus, <em>p. 353</em>]</p><p>According to Bantu myth, the myths of the Bantu people… the despotic Bantu emperor eats in public, he doesn’t hide his face. But then a disturbing man arrives: the man of the State. The man of the State has no army. I say this to remind those of you who were here two years ago, of things that we touched upon then but didn’t develop… In any case, they’re still a bit hazy. He doesn’t have an army, but he has a police force, a bureaucracy, but no army. He undertakes major public works. He shows his face everywhere, his eyes like black holes. To each of his subjects he says: “I am here.”</p><p>And now another figure arrives from who knows where: a little guy who has come from the exterior, the man of War. Who will conquer everything and destroy it all. The man of War isn’t a paranoiac, nor is he a despot. He’s from another race, no better but different. He’s something else. He arrives. And in the Bantu myth he doesn’t eat in public. He wears a veil, he eats in a tent. We’re not supposed to see him. He’s the secret. The regime of the secret was invented by the Mongols. Or by this Bantu who was not really a Bantu but… It was invented by the Mongols, meaning the nomads, the guys of the war machine. For them, speaking of State secrets is a nonsense. There is no such thing. The State doesn’t need secrets. It’s the military machine that needs and invents secrets. It’s the warrior chief who eats veiled and who invents them. In this there’s no publicity. And meanwhile the despot continually repeats: “Look into my eyes!”</p><p>So, well then, we must add that if the Signifier requires the wall and the black hole of the face, it is for all the reasons we have looked at concerning the face. We don’t need to go back to that. Sometimes we just have to accept the things we’ve acquired, you see? After all, it’s that all this thing is linked up. We just notice suddenly, as we’re thinking that we’re heading in one direction, we then stumble upon something else and say, hey, that’s fine, we’ve seen this. So, it’s perfect.</p><p>Why? What roles does the face play with respect to the signifier? Returning to the distinctions I proposed between index, icon and symbol, the Signifier, which is the most deterritorialized of signs — since it makes sure that all other signs refer to all other signs — requires any form whatever of reterritorialization. The face is the form of reterritorialization proper to the Signifier. This is why we have to undo the face. The face is the icon of the Signifier. So, there we have the fifth dimension.</p><p>A sixth one [<em>Pause</em>], a sixth dimension: there aren’t many left. So now the sixth dimension. A new adventure begins in which I’ll need another dimension. So, we already have a six-dimensional multiplicity. What is this exactly?</p><p>Imagine the following; let’s dream a bit. Through his interpretations, the diviner-priest continually recharges the system of signifiance. He prevents the growth of entropy. But it’s not enough. The system is nonetheless menaced. Several other related operations are required. It functions but only up to a certain point. It needs something else. The entropy that menaces the system is also a line by means of which the irradiating circular system would escape, escape into the quicksands of the amorphous continuum, tracing death in a shallow stream. The system’s line of flight has to be blocked. And this is something that no diviner with his interpretations can do. The line of flight has to be barred. Which is why it can only exist as a broken, dotted line. So, what can be done?</p><p>In Foucault’s <em>Discipline and Punish</em>, there’s a marvellous page where he says that the body of the condemned man is like the inverted, symmetrical image of the body of the king. The torture victim’s body is the symmetrically inverted image of the king’s body. We can also say that it is the symmetrically inverted image of the despot’s body. Indeed, the condemned or tortured man has above all else lost his face. He hasn’t lost the <em>id</em>. He has become the man without a face. What does that mean?</p><p>To be a torture victim is not the last word. Although in a certain sense it is, since he’s going to die… But here the logical chain is very strange. Torture is never the end. In the logical chain, the historico-logical chain, torture is always followed by something else. It comes before expulsion. And Oedipus, to cite him again, begins by blinding himself, meaning that he loses face. And he runs away. He runs away, or rather he is sent away. He is cast out by Creon on the system’s line of flight: “Go, get out!”</p><p>There exist two goats. In the ritual of the goat, there are always two goats that assure the logical chain, otherwise it couldn’t be assured. First of all, there is the goat we call <em>scapegoat,</em> which will be killed. But following this, and only following this, is another, much more significant, goat called the <em>emissary</em> goat which is chased away along the line of flight. You understand why the system needs two goats… because they must first kill and then chase away. And this is the true logic. To be able to proceed, two goats are required.</p><p>Now what is this emissary goat? It is the anti-face… The goat’s anus is the inverted image of the despot’s gaze. The goat is made to flee along the line of flight. And what does the goat carry with it? It carries everything that has compromised – during periods of ritual, for example – the signifiance of the system, that is, the load of forbidden jumps, and everything that has threatened the signifiance of signs. And everything that has threatened the face… the face of the Signifier. It takes upon itself all these evils. And the goat is cast out into the desert.</p><p>So, the last dimension of the system is the presence of a line of flight but one that is afflicted with a negative value. On which the emissary goat will be forced to flee – or we could call it the exile, or the damned, which is an essential cog in the system of signifiance. It’s as though everything that threatens signifiance has to be cast out.</p><p>Last dimension: in other words, what does it represent, this broken line of flight along which the goat is cast out? We just need to connect up all our dimensions. It represents the following: the line that, through its tenor, exceeds the level of deterritorialization permitted by the system of signifiance, however high or advanced may be this deterritorialization, however far the system of signifiance enters into the deterritorialization. In reality it doesn’t go very far. It reterritorializes on the face, it reterritorializes on overcodings, it reterritorializes in every way imaginable.</p><p>Therefore, what surpasses its own level of deterritorialization will be as if barred, marked by a negative value, a negative sign. And this is it: the minus sign that marks the ritual of the emissary goat. Or else, this is the ritual of exile.</p><p>So, I’m almost done. Perhaps you would you be so kind as to share your thoughts with me on all this. I would say that now at least, [<em>Deleuze indicates the first schema</em>] we won’t have any problem linking — this will occur almost in a concrete way — linking our second figure, the successive linear figure of proceedings, to the first one will happen almost as a matter of course. It won’t be difficult because… let’s imagine the following story – I’m go back to some themes I quickly threw at you last time — imagine the following story:</p><p>One day a people are forced to leave or abandon their temple, or even to see their temple destroyed. In the case where they have to leave the temple, they carry with them a small ark that is at continual risk of falling… a small fragile ark. Naturally they dream of rebuilding a temple. However, this temple is again and again destroyed at regular intervals. To simplify we can say that they lost their temple.</p><p>The whole system of signifiance trembles. Also, for other reasons, but we’re telling a story here, the whole system of signifiance risks crumbling to dust. The master Signifier, the eyes, the face, nothing works any more. Aside from which, this people or this person – we don’t yet need to know which of these it concerns – will precipitate onto the line of flight with the ark. Except that… and what is the stroke of genius, the radically new thing here? What will be his momentous words? “Let misfortune befall us.” But since we no longer have a temple, we no longer have a scapegoat. <em>Unless we become our own scapegoat</em>. Unless we become our own sacrificial lamb. The goat and the lamb are the same thing.</p><p>In John of Patmos’s <em>Apocalypse</em> – yes, John of Patmos… he can’t possibly be the other John… In the <em>Apocalypse</em> there is the lion, the lion that roars, but we never see this roaring lion. What appears is a lamb. In the system of signifiance, the immolated God will take the place of the immolating God. The lamb… even if the lion continues roaring over him, and God knows it’s a lion-lamb, but the lion takes the skin of the lamb. We shall be our own lamb, our own goat. We no longer have a temple; we cannot cast out what was menacing the system because we no longer have a system. Therefore, we shall be the ones who take the line of flight. We shall be the goat and the lamb. “Let misfortune befall us.”</p><p>So, they leave for the desert, the narrow passage. The extraordinary thing here is that the line of flight has now taken on a positive sign. And an astounding abyss opens up between the two systems. The line of flight has become positivity, while in all other despotic formations it was marked by negation, by a negative value. It was the place where what menaced the system was made to take flight. Now a whole group, a whole people sets off on foot in the narrow passage of the desert, having lost their temple, having become their own scapegoat and lamb. And they flee along the line of flight, which for that very reason becomes positive.</p><p>From a certain perspective, it’s a new step, a new level… a new threshold of deterritorialization has been passed. The deterritorialization of the passional system will be infinitely greater and stronger than the deterritorialization of signifiance. So you understand that, beginning from this first dimension of the system, other dimensions multiply.</p><p>I’m just saying – because we’ve had enough of this; I would like to discuss this a little with you — I will just add that the function of faciality, of the face, cannot be the same here. But I’ve forgotten to mention something that will complete our framework. Here I don’t even need to… anyway, in what way is this as much the system of deception as one of paranoid delusion, a delusion of interpretation? It’s both a social formation and a despotic formation. According to – this is almost a practical exercise – according to the characteristic I proposed to you – and you might want to add others, combine them, subtract, underline some – and what you will obtain is a delusion in hospital, a social formation, a system, what kind? A system of groups, of individuals, a system for which we’ve had proposed the name “system of deception.” Why?</p><p>Because everything it contains is deception. Everything is deception, trickery, at every level. In the centre, you have the face of the despot. The despot’s face, this type of mask that priests manipulate when necessary, making it speak. The impotent despot and so on… Therefore, you have deception at the centre of signifiance, and deception in interpretation.</p><p>It’s well known that the diviner is essentially a trickster. Deception at the level of the jumps. Deception at the level of forbidden jumps, whereby whoever makes a forbidden jump deceives. But deception reigns also at the level of jumps that are completely regulated. My wife has betrayed me so I will pray for a calamity to strike the whole village.</p><p>And in a certain sense, this is the way the State apparatus functions. And with it the man of the State, through this widespread deception in which also humble subjects deceive, the despot deceives, everyone deceives. It doesn’t mean anything, it’s not against the law. Deception really is an integral part of the functioning, one of the cogs of the system. The same goes for the courtier who stays close to the despot, or for the man of the State — the despot’s functionary — as for ordinary subjects, and so on, everyone is engaged in deception.</p><p>So here, not only should we expect there to be a manner of functioning completely different from that of the face and faciality, but also one that is completely different from that of deception. So, from this point everything will change. But it’s quite random. I began from this dimension [<em>Deleuze indicates the first schema</em>], but I may as well have begun from another. A new sign is attributed to the line of flight or the line of deterritorialization. Rather than having a negative sign, which is already occupied by the goat, it takes up a positive sign insofar as a whole group… So here we have the abandoned temple, from which the people carry away a packet of signs, a little packet of signs that they will carry with them as they head off into the desert. And there will be a succession of proceedings. One, two, three, four and so on. All of which will be punctuated by pauses. A small packet of homogeneous signs flees along a segmented line. Or it’s the figure that’s completely different from the previous one.</p><p>So, we need to expect, and we will see this after, in what sense the face changes both its figure and function — which suits us perfectly since we discovered there were two types of face with respect to the question of faciality — in what sense is this no longer a regime of deception but a different type of regime? What happens in this system?</p><p>Let’s not forget that we, “modern” people, how can I say, we people of Christian… Greco-Christian background, and I’ve no idea why we’re called that, or more simply we could say those of us who belong to a capitalist system or a certain social formation, we always live in mixed semiotics.</p><p>Concrete semiotics are always mixed. A piece of this system bumps into a piece of this other system… It’s always like that and the contrary, and everything all mixed up. In the mechanisms of banking, to take a random example, we have the system of rotation and circular expansion and at the same time bits of proceedings. And concrete social machines function by means of this mixity not only between the two systems – since we looked only at two examples of semiotics… But to go on answering your question, there can be infinite numbers of semiotics: 8, 10, 12… we will see…</p><p>I can only say that in what we did before, for example, the semiotic that for convenience’s sake we called “primitive”, the corporeal semiotic of “primitive” peoples, doesn’t refer either to this system [<em>the first schema</em>] or that [<em>the second schema</em>]. It’s a very specific type of semiotic, and even when we say “primitive” semiotic, that encompasses semiotics that are completely different from each other. And the nomadic semiotic I just mentioned doesn’t equate either with this one [<em>the second schema</em>] or that one [<em>the first schema</em>]. So, you can never have enough semiotics.</p><p>We “moderns” live — and here, I could cite one of Nietzsche’s most wonderful phrases, if only I could remember it [<em>Laughter</em>]… I can’t, but it was great anyway [<em>Laughter</em>]… “<em>a variegated painting of all that has been thought</em>” [<em>In fact, “ye who are pictures of all that hath ever been believed”, from</em> Thus Spoke Zarathustra, <em>“The Land of Culture”; see also</em> Nietzsche and Philosophy, <em>V.11, “The Sense of Affirmation”</em>]  And by that, he didn’t mean to define us merely as people but as a social formation. “A variegated painting of all that has been thought” — And this is what we live from. All the old semiotics are fine for us. I think that money, the semiotics of money, has made a syncretism of all the semiotics there have ever been, whether primitive, signifying, passional, nomadic, whatever… So, what do you think? Does that suffice? Have you had enough? [<em>Laughter, scattered applause, Deleuze chuckles</em>] … [<em>Tape interrupted</em>] [4:15:15]</p><p>[<em>Although this could suffice for the session, the film recording continues with six minutes of discussion with one of Deleuze’s frequent interlocutors, his student Georges Comtesse</em>]</p><p>Georges Comtesse: … Not at all… the system of this face-substance centre, the face as signifying substance, not only what is at the heart of things – I don’t mean <em>heart</em> in the sense of provenance [<em>The camera, moving right, shows Claire Parnet standing and smoking</em>] but on a given surface, given line of divergence of sense, which is the paranoiac line. I think there is a becoming. In encounters, there is always a very intensive becoming that seems to me the becoming which provokes an excess of signs, almost as the defect of the sign, of this excess of concentric circles… and that has a profound relationship with the becoming-paranoiac. Becoming intense, isn’t that… so what is it?</p><p>In the case of president Schreber, it’s simply a becoming-woman. How great it would be to be a woman who submits to coupling. Paranoid femininity… But already, in all paranoias – and this is the rule of paranoia – right from the beginning no paranoiac can bear a becoming intense or this kind of femininity. Every paranoiac, if he’s not a philosopher, if he doesn’t recompose a line of reconvergence of sense… every paranoiac, as soon as they experience it, even just for an instant, a fleeting instant… every paranoiac want to arrest this becoming at all costs, “police” the becoming, stop it at all costs and start again for example, from a sign, the sign of sex as it happens, because sex is also a sign – and perhaps it’s the sign of becoming intense that makes the jump. At which point there will be a deterritorialization, which won’t just be that of the concentric circles or the signs on them that you spoke about. What will be produced in this arrest of becoming as a centre of signifiance, a surface not at all like the one you described… it’s not a white surface with black holes, because this seems to me a secondary effect, even if it’s true that it is there…</p><p>Deleuze: Ah… that’s rich…</p><p>Comtesse: And there is…</p><p>Deleuze: That’s rich that you call it a secondary effect!</p><p>Comtesse: And there is continually a surface of the arrest of becoming, or of the excess of signs, that I would call… the virginal surface of voluptuousness with a black abyss which does not…</p><p>Deleuze: Oh well, shit! Give me a break! [<em>General laughter</em>]</p><p>Comtesse: … which does not at all equate….</p><p>Deleuze (<em>standing up</em>): You’ll excuse me, I’ll let you finish afterwards, but now you’re really having a laugh. You tell us: “Your white wall-black hole system doesn’t work”. You tell me, what works for you is a virginal surface with a…</p><p>Comtesse: A black abyss…</p><p>Deleuze: With a black abyss. [<em>Deleuze chortles with everyone</em>] Fine, fine. Given this, I understand what you are saying – no, no, I’ll let you continue in a second – in saying, which you add, there’s a becoming in paranoid delusion,</p><p>Comtesse: Yes!</p><p>Deleuze: … except that, here’s the point, it’s entirely blocked off…</p><p>Comtesse: Exactly!</p><p>Deleuze: This isn’t… So, here you’re providing a confirmation…</p><p>Comtesse: Certainly!</p><p>Deleuze: And I add to confirm what you are saying that, as you know better than I do, President Schreber’s rapport with God occurs through rays, and these rays interest us in terms of the white wall-black hole system, because through binarity, arborescence and binary relationships, they divide the world into a higher and lower sphere. And in its turn, the lower world is divided in two and so on. Everything you said – and this is not a retort to your observation – makes me happy because it absolutely confirms everything we said – it’s a benediction for us!</p><p>Comtesse: Perhaps there isn’t just the landscape-face system but also a mirage-shore type of pictorial splitting…</p><p>Deleuze: You’re saying <em>mirage</em>… now I understand!</p><p>Comtesse: I want to continue! I’m saying virginal surface of voluptuousness… You speak about God, for example.</p><p>Deleuze: Yes, yes?</p><p>Comtesse: Eventually, President Schreber perceives his own voluptuousness as though it were that of God in his virginal surface, which is a surface of the scream…</p><p>Deleuze: Now you’re bringing us back to castration!</p><p>Comtesse: … a scream. [<em>Pause, laughter</em>] I’m not at all bringing it back to that; I’m not at all bring it back to that. I’m saying that you go too fast when you talk about the signifier. I’m just talking about becoming, arrest of becoming, virginal surface of voluptuousness with a black abyss of desire…</p><p>Deleuze:  I think we can work this out.</p><p>Comtesse: It’s clear that the virginal surface and the white surface…</p><p>Deleuze: I wouldn’t call it virginal…</p><p>Comtesse: They could be linked…</p><p>Deleuze: Okay if you prefer virginal to white, we can agree on that.</p><p>Comtesse: Absolutely! Perhaps the line of flight you inserted there flies off on the passional delusion… Let’s take Pierre Rivière. [<em>Note that Michel Foucault’s book on Pierre Rivière appeared in 1973</em>] With Pierre Rivière, in the beginning there seems to be a binarism. For example, he opposes himself to the father, mortified, humiliated disgusted, and against matriarchal power, which is mortifying, almost vampiric, all that, the infinite indebtedness of the father, its power which provokes his suicide, and so on. It seems there is a binarity there. But in fact, in fact, he is experimenting. Through this pseudo-binarity, he is experimenting with a becoming-woman of the father… [<em>End of the recording</em>] [4:21:39]</p><a href=#lecture-1-november-16-1971><h1 id=lecture-1-november-16-1971><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Lecture 1: NOVEMBER 16, 1971</h1></a><p>Traditional psychoanalysis enclosed the libidinal investments of desire in the familial triangle and structuralism is the last attempt [<em>tentative</em>] to save Oedipus at the moment when Oedipus is coming apart at the seams.

Deleuze connects capitalism directly to schizophrenia, both based on decoded and deterritorialized flows, their identity occurring at the level of the economic process, through a system of conjunction, deterriorializing flows and then tying together an identity. Responding to student questions, Deleuze explores the internal threats to society, the danger of flows decoding themselves, and he considers competing anthropological explanations of flows and their blockages and possible recourses for continued flows, including sorcery, all of which is swept away by the introduction of money with a new circuit of consumption given that capitalism no longer counts on any code. Deleuze also details the opposition posed by schizo-analysis to psychoanalysis’s introduction of the triangular axiomatic by emphasizing dual dimensions of desire: desiring machines working within the unconscious with no reference to Oedipus or castration, and desire understood in terms of its socio-political investments rather than familial. Hence the three tasks of schizo-analysis: the first destructive task, countering the Oedipal and castrating structures; a first positive task, a functional analysis of desiring machines; and a second positive task, understanding the investment of desiring machines in the social machines.</p><p><img src=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Deleuze-at-Mas-Revery-with-son-Julien-01-800x450.jpg width=auto alt></p><a href=#about-this-lecture><h3 id=about-this-lecture><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>ABOUT THIS LECTURE</h3></a><p><strong>Lecture 01, 16 November 1971</strong></p><p><strong>Translated by Rojan Josh;</strong> t<strong>ranscribed by

He suggests that capitalism operates on the principle of decoding and deterritorializing flows. This is a stark contrast to other societal structures that have attempted to code and territorialize these flows.</p><p>Capitalism, according to Deleuze, employs an axiomatic system to manage these flows. However, it constantly grapples with the risk of flows that evade its axioms, leading to potential crises.</p><p>Drawing a parallel between capitalism and schizophrenia, Deleuze posits that schizophrenia also involves a process of decoding and deterritorializing flows. However, it resists being axiomatized or recoded. In this sense, schizophrenia can be seen as the inverse of capitalism, which itself is the inverse of all other societies. Schizophrenia embodies a desire that transcends the constraints of capitalism and its codes.</p><p>Deleuze provides several historical examples of decoded and deterritorialized flows, such as money, labor, and women. He critiques psychoanalytic and structuralist approaches to these flows for their attempts to impose an Oedipal and castrating structure on them. Instead, he advocates for a schizoanalysis that would examine how desiring machines function and invest in relation to social machines.</p><a href=#codes-capitalism-flows-decoding-flows-capitalism-and-schizophrenia-psychoanalysis><h3 id=codes-capitalism-flows-decoding-flows-capitalism-and-schizophrenia-psychoanalysis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span><strong>Codes, Capitalism, Flows, Decoding Flows, Capitalism and Schizophrenia, Psychoanalysis</strong></h3></a><p>… What is it that moves over the body of a society? It is always flows, and a person is always a cutting off [<em>coupure</em>] of a flow. A person is always a point of departure for the production of a flow, a point of destination for the reception of a flow, a flow of any kind; or, better yet, an interception of many flows.</p><p>If a person has hair, this hair can move through many stages: the hairstyle of a young girl is not the same as that of a married woman, it is not the same as that of a widow: there is a whole hairstyle code. A person, insofar as she styles her hair, typically presents herself as an interceptor in relation to flows of hair that exceed her and exceed her case and these flows of hair are themselves coded according to very different codes: widow code, young girl code, married woman code, etc. This is ultimately the essential problem of coding and of the territorialization which is always coding flows with it, as a fundamental means of operation: marking persons (because persons are situated at the interception and at the cutting off [<em>coupure</em>] of flows, they exist at the points where flows are cut off [<em>coupure</em>]).</p><p>But now, more than marking persons—marking persons is the apparent means of operation—coding has a deeper function, that is to say, a society is only afraid of one thing: the deluge; it is not afraid of the void, it is not afraid of dearth or scarcity. Over a society, over its social body, something flows [<em>coule</em>] and we do not know what it is, something flows that is not coded, and something which, in relation to this society, even appears as the uncodable. Something which would flow and which would carry away this society to a kind of deterritorialization which would make the earth upon which it has set itself up dissolve: this, then, is the crisis. We encounter something that crumbles, and we do not know what it is, it responds to no code, it flees underneath the codes.</p><p>And this is even true, in this respect, for capitalism which for a long time believed it could always secure simili-codes; this, then, is what we call the well-known power [<em>puissance</em>] of recuperation within capitalism—when we say recuperate we mean: each time something seems to escape capitalism, seems to pass beneath its simili-codes; it reabsorbs all this, it adds one more axiom and the machine starts up again. Think of capitalism in the 19th century: it sees the flowing of a pole of flow that is, literally, a flow, the flow of workers, a proletariat flow: well, what is this which flows, which flows wickedly and which carries away our earth, where are we headed? The thinkers of the 19th century have a very strange response, notably the French historical school: it was the first in the 19th century to have thought in terms of classes, they are the ones who invent the theoretical notion of classes and invent it precisely as an essential fragment of the capitalist code, namely: the legitimacy of capitalism comes from this: the victory of the bourgeoisie as a class opposed to the aristocracy.</p><p>The system that appears in the works of Saint Simon, Augustin Thierry, Edgar Quinet is the radical seizure of consciousness by the bourgeoisie as a class and they interpret all of history as a class struggle. It is not Marx who invents the understanding of history as a class struggle, it is the bourgeois historical school of the 19th century: 1789, yes, it is a class struggle, they are struck blind when they see flowing, on the actual surface of the social body, this weird flow that they do not recognize: the proletariat flow. The idea that this is a class is not possible, it is not one at this moment: the day when capitalism can no longer deny that the proletariat is a class, this coincides with the moment when, in its head, it found the moment to recode all this.</p><p>That which we call the power [<em>puissance</em>] of recuperation of capitalism, what is it? [It consists] in having at its disposal a kind of axiomatic, and when it sets upon [<em>dispose de</em>] some new thing which it does not recognize, as with every axiomatic, it is an axiomatic with a limit that cannot be saturated: it is always ready to add one more axiom to restore its functioning.</p><p>When capitalism can no longer deny that the proletariat is a class, when it comes to recognize a type of class bipolarity, under the influence of workers’ struggles in the 19th century, and under the influence of the revolution, this moment is extraordinarily ambiguous, for it is an important moment in the revolutionary struggle, but it is also an essential moment in capitalist recuperation: I make you one more axiom, I make you axioms for the working class and for the union power [<em>puissance</em>] that represents them, and the capitalist machine grinds its gears and starts up again, it has sealed the breach. In other words, all the bodies of a society are essential: to prevent the flowing over society, over its back, over its body, of flows that it cannot code and to which it cannot assign a territoriality.</p><p>Need, scarcity, famine, a society can code these, what it cannot code, is when this thing appears, when it says to itself: what is up with these guys? So, in a first phase, the repressive apparatus puts itself into motion, if we can’t code it, we will try to annihilate it. In a second phase, we try to find new axioms which allow it to be recoded for better or worse.</p><p>A social body is well defined as follows: there is perpetual trickery, flows flow over from one pole to another, and they are perpetually coded, and there are flows that escape from the codes. And then there is the social effort to recuperate all that, to axiomatize all this, to manipulate the code a little, so as to make room for flows that are also dangerous: all of a sudden. There are young people who do not respond to the code: they insist on having a flow of hair which was not expected, what shall we do now? We try to recode it, we will add an axiom, we will try to recuperate [it] but then [if] there is something within it that continues not to let itself be coded, what then?</p><p>In other words, this is the fundamental action of a society: to code the flows and to treat as an enemy anyone who presents himself, in relation to society, as an uncodable flow, because, once again, it challenges [<em>met en question</em>] the entire earth, the whole body of this society.</p><p>I will say this of every society, except perhaps of our own—that is, capitalism, even though just now I spoke of capitalism as if it coded all the flows in the same way as all other societies and did not have any other problems, but perhaps I was going too fast.</p><p>There is a fundamental paradox in capitalism as a social formation: if it is true that the terror of all the other social formations was decoded flows, capitalism, for its part, historically constituted itself on an unbelievable thing: namely, that which was the terror of other societies: the existence and the reality of decoded flows and these, capitalism made its proper concern.</p><p>If this were true, it would explain that capitalism is, in a very precise sense, the universal form of all societies: in a negative sense, capitalism would be that which all societies dreaded above all, and we cannot help but have the impression that, historically speaking, capitalism… In a certain sense, is what every social formation constantly tried to exorcise, what it constantly tried to avoid, why? Because it was the ruin of every other social formation. And the paradox of capitalism is that a social formation constituted itself on the basis of that which was the negative of all the others. This means that capitalism was not able to constitute itself except through a conjunction, an encounter between decoded flows of all kinds. The thing which was dreaded most of all by every social formation was the basis for a social formation that had to engulf all the others: that what was the negative of all formations has become the very positivity of ours, this makes one shudder.</p><p>And in what sense was capitalism constituted on the conjunction of decoded flows? It required extraordinary encounters at the end of a process [<em>processus</em>] of decodings of every kind, which were formed with the decline of feudalism. These decodings of all kinds consisted in the decoding of land flows, under the form of the constitution of large private properties, the decoding of monetary flows, under the form of the development of merchant fortunes, the decoding of a flow of workers under the form of expropriation, of the deterritorialization of serfs and peasant landholders. And this is not enough, for if we take the example of Rome, the decoding in decadent Rome, all this clearly happened: the decoding of flows of property under the form of large private properties, the decoding of monetary flows under the forms of large private fortunes, the decoding of laborers with the formation of an urban sub-proletariat: everything is found here, almost everything. The elements of capitalism are found here all together, only there is no encounter.</p><p>What was necessary for the encounter to be made between the decoded flows of capital or of money and the decoded flows of laborers, for the encounter to be made between the flow of emergent capital and the flow of deterritorialized manpower, literally, the flow of decoded money and the flow of deterritorialized laborers. Indeed, the manner in which money is decoded so as to become money capital and the manner in which the laborer is ripped from the earth in order to become the owner of his/her labor power [<em>force de travail</em>] alone: these are two processes totally independent from each other, there must be an encounter between the two.</p><p>Indeed, for the process of the decoding of money to form capital that is made all across the embryonic forms of commercial capital and banking capital, the flow of labor, the free possessor of his/her labor power alone, is made across a whole other line that is the deterritorialization of the laborer at the end of feudalism, and this could very well not have been encountered. A conjunction of decoded and deterritorialized flows, this is at the basis of capitalism. Capitalism is constituted on the failure of all the pre-existent codes and social territorialities.</p><p>If we admit this, what does this represent? The capitalist machine, it is literally demented. A social machine that functions on the basis of decoded, deterritorialized flows, once again, it is not that societies did not have any idea of this; they had the idea in the form of panic, they acted to prevent this — it was the overturning of all the social codes known up to that point — ; so, a society that constitutes itself on the negative of all pre-existing societies, how can it function? A society for which it is proper to decode and deterritorialize all the flows — flow of production, flow of consumption — how can it function, under what form? Perhaps capitalism has other processes than coding to make it work, perhaps it is completely different.</p><p>What I have been seeking up until now was to reground, at a certain level, the problem of the relation capitalism / schizophrenia, and the grounding of a relation is found in something common between capitalism and the schizo: what they have totally in common. And it is perhaps a community that is never realized, that does not assume a concrete figure; it is a community of a principle that remains abstract, namely, the one like the other does not cease to filter, to emit, to intercept, to concentrate decoded and deterritorialized flows.</p><p>This is their profound identity, and it is not at the level of a way of life that capitalism renders us schizophrenic. It is at the level of the economic process: all this only works through a system of conjunction — say the word then — on condition of accepting that this word implies a veritable difference in nature from codes. It is capitalism that functions like an axiomatic, an axiomatic of decoded flows. All other social formations functioned on the basis of a coding and of a territorialization of flows and between a capitalist machine that makes an axiomatic of decoded flows such as they are or deterritorialized flows, such as they are, and other social formations, there is truly a difference in nature that makes capitalism the negative of other societies. Now, the schizo, in his own way, with his own tottering walk, he does the same thing. In a sense, he is more capitalist than the capitalist, more <code>prole’ than the </code>prole’: he decodes, he deterritorializes the flows and knots together a kind of identity in nature of capitalism and the schizo.</p><p>Schizophrenia is the negative of the capitalist formation. In a sense, schizophrenia goes further, capitalism functioned on a conjunction of decoded flows, on one condition, that is, at the same time that it perpetually decoded flows of money, flows of labor, etc., it incorporated them, it constructed a new type of machine, at the same time, not afterwards, that was not a coding machine, but an axiomatic machine.</p><p>It is in this way that it succeeds in making a coherent system, on condition that we say what profoundly distinguishes an axiomatic of decoded flows and a coding of flows. Whereas the schizo, he does more, he does not let himself be axiomatized either, he always goes further with the decoded flows, making do with no flows at all, rather than letting himself be coded, no earth at all, rather than letting himself be territorialized.</p><p>What is their relation to each other? It is from this point that the problem arises. One must study more closely the relation capitalism / schizophrenia, giving the greatest importance to this: is it true and in what sense can we define capitalism as a machine that functions on the basis of decoded flows, on the basis of deterritorialized flows? In what sense is it the negative of all social formations, and along the same lines, in what sense is schizophrenia the negative of capitalism, that it goes even further in decoding and in deterritorialization? And just where does it go, and where does that take it? Towards a new earth, towards no earth at all, towards the deluge?</p><p>If I try to link up with the problems of psychoanalysis, in what sense, in what manner—this is strictly a beginning—, I assume that there is something in common between capitalism, as a social structure, and schizophrenia as a process. Something in common that makes it so that the schizo is produced as the negative of capitalism — itself the negative of all the rest –, and that this relation, we can now comprehend it by considering its terms: coding of flows, decoded and deterritorialized flows, axiomatic of decoded flows, etc.</p><p>It remains to be seen what in the psychoanalytic and psychiatric problem continues to preoccupy us. One must reread three texts of Marx: in book I: the production of surplus value, the chapter on the tendential fall in the last book, and finally, in the <em>Grundrisse,</em> the chapter on automation.</p><p><strong>Richard Zrehen:</strong> I did not understand what you said in regard to the analogy between capitalism and schizophrenia, when you said capitalism is the negative of other societies and the schizo is the negative of capitalism, I would have understood that capitalism is to other societies what the schizo is to capitalism, but, I would have thought, on the contrary, that you were not going to make this opposition. I would have thought of the opposition: capitalism / other societies and schizophrenia/ something else, instead of an analogy in three terms, to make one in four terms.</p><p><strong>Cyril:</strong> Richard means to say the opposition between: capitalism/ other societies and schizophrenia and neuroses, for example.</p><p><strong>Deleuze:</strong> Haaa, yes, yes, yes, yes. We are defining flows in political economy, its importance with actual economists confirms what I have been saying. For the moment, a flow is something, in a society, that flows from one pole to another, and that passes through a person, only to the degree that persons are interceptors.</p><p><strong>A student: [<em>Inaudible comment</em>]</strong></p><p><strong>Deleuze:</strong> Let me take an example, you say that in a society one does not stop decoding, I’m not sure: I believe that there are two things in a society, one of which pertains to the principle by which a society comes to an end [<em>se termine</em>], one of which pertains to the death of a society: all death, in a certain manner, appears—this is the great principle of Thanatos—from inside [<em>dedans</em>] and all death comes from outside [<em>dehors</em>]. I mean that there is an internal menace in every society, this menace being represented by the danger of flows decoding themselves, it makes sense.</p><p>There is never a flow first, and then a code that imposes itself upon it. The two are coexistent. Which is the problem, if I again take up the studies, already quite old, of [Claude] Levi-Strauss on marriage: he tells us: the essential in a society is circulation and exchange. Marriage, alliance, is exchanging, and what is important is that it circulates and that it exchanges. There is, then, a flow of women—raising something to a coefficient flow seems to me to be a social operation, the social operation of flows. At the level of society, there are no women, there is a flow of women that refers to a code, a code of age-old things, of clans, of tribes, but there is always flow of women, and then, in a second moment, a code: the code and the flow are absolutely formed face to face with one another.</p><p>What is it the problem then, at the level of marriage, in a so-called primitive society? It is that, in relation to flows of women, by virtue of a code, there is something that must pass through. It involves forming a sort of system, not at all like Levi-Strauss suggests, not at all a logical combinatory [<em>combinatoire</em>], but a physical system with territorialities: something enters, something exits. So here we clearly see that, brought into relation with a physical system of marriage, women present themselves in the form of a flow. Regarding this flow, the social code means this: in relation to such a flow, something of the flow must pass through, i.e.: flow; something must not go through; and, third — this will make up the three fundamental terms of every code — something must effect the passing through or, on the contrary, the blocking: for example, in matrilineal systems, everyone knows the importance of the maternal [<em>utérine</em>] uncle, why, in the flow of women, what passes through is the permitted or even prescribed marriage.</p><p>A schizo, in a society like that, he is not there; literally, it belongs to us, over there, it is something else.</p><p>There, it is different: there is a very good case studied by Pierre Clastres; there is a guy who does not know, he does not know whom he must marry, he attempts a voyage of deterritorialization to see a faraway sorcerer.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-01-15/#_edn1 rel=noopener>1</a> There is a great English ethnologist named [Edmund] Leach whose whole thesis consists in saying: it never works like Levi-Strauss says it does, he does not believe in Levi-Strauss’s system: no one knows who to marry; Leach makes a fundamental discovery, that which he calls local groups and distinguishes from groups of filiation. Local groups, these are the little groups that machine [<em>machinent</em>] marriages and alliances and they do not deduce them from filiations: the alliance is a kind of strategy that responds to political givens. A local group is literally a group (perverse, specialists in coding) that determines, for each caste, what can pass through, what cannot pass through, that which must be blocked, that which can flow.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-01-15/#_edn2 rel=noopener>2</a></p><p>In a matrilineal system, what is blocked? That which is blocked in all systems, that which falls under the rules of the prohibition of incest. Here, something in the flow of women is blocked; namely, certain persons are eliminated from the flow of marriageable women, in relation to other persons. That which, on the contrary, passes through is, we could say, the first permitted incest: the first legal incests in the form of preferential marriages; but everyone knows that the first permitted incests are never practiced in fact, it is still too close to that which is blocked. You see that the flow is interrupted here, something in the flow is blocked, something passes through, and here, there are the great perverts who machine marriages, who block or who effect passages. In the history of the maternal uncle, the aunt is blocked as an image of forbidden incest, in the form of a jesting kinship, the nephew has, with his aunt, a very joyous relation, with his uncle, a relation of theft, but theft, injuries, these are coded; see [Bronislaw] Malinowski.</p><p><strong>A student:</strong> These local groups have magical powers?</p><p><strong>Deleuze:</strong> They have an overtly political power [<em>pouvoir</em>], they sometimes call upon sorcery, but they are not witchcraft groups, they are political groups who define the strategy of a village in relation to another village, and a clan in relation to another clan.</p><p>Every code in relation to flows implies that we prevent something of this flow from passing through, we block it, we let something pass: there will be people having a key position as interceptors, i.e. so as to prevent passage or, on the contrary, to effect passage, and when we take note that these characters are such that, according to the code, certain prestations return to them; we better understand how the whole system works.</p><p>In all societies, the problem was always to code flows and to recode those that tended to escape—when is it that the codes vacillate in so-called primitive societies: essentially at the moment of colonialization, there where the code flees under the pressure of capitalism. For that is what it represents in a society of codes, the introduction of money; it scatters to the winds their entire circuit of flows, in the sense that they distinguish essentially three types of flows: the flows of production to be consumed, the flows of prestige, objects of prestige and flows of women. When money is introduced therein, it is a catastrophe — see what [Robert] Jaulin analyses as ethnocide: money, Oedipus complex.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-01-15/#_edn3 rel=noopener>3</a></p><p>They try to relate money to their code, as such it can only be a prestige good. It is not a production or consumption good, it is not a woman, but the young people of the tribe who understand quicker than the elders take advantage of money in order to seize hold of the circuit of consumption goods, the circuit of consumption that was traditionally, in certain tribes, controlled by women. So the young people, with money, seize hold of the circuit of consumption. With money which itself can no longer be coded, within a certain framework, we begin with money, and we end with money.</p><p>M[oney]-C[ommodity]-M[oney], there is absolutely no means of coding this thing here because the qualified flows are replaced by a flow of abstract quantity whose proper essence is the infinite reproduction for which the formula is M-C-M. No code can support infinite reproduction. What is formidable in so-called primitive societies is how debt exists, but exists in the form of a finite block, debt is finite.</p><p>So, in this sense flows pass their time by fleeing, it does not prevent the codes from being correlative and coding the flows. Undoubtedly, it escapes from all sides, and the one who does not let her/himself be coded, and so we say: that’s a madman; we will code him/her: the village madman, we will make a code of the code.</p><p>The originality of capitalism is that it no longer counts on any code. There are code residues, but no one believes in them: we no longer believe in anything. The last code that capitalism knew how to produce was fascism: an effort to recode and reterritorialize even at the economic level, at the level of the functioning of the market in the fascist economy. Here we clearly see an extreme effort to resuscitate a kind of code that would function like the code of capitalism; literally, it could have lasted in the form in which it has lasted. As for capitalism, it is incapable of furnishing a code that covers the ensemble of the social field like a grid [<em>quadrille</em>], because its problems no longer pose themselves in terms of code. Its problem is to make a mechanism of decoded flows as such, so it is uniquely in this sense that I oppose capitalism as a social formation to all the other known social formations.</p><p>Can we say that between a coding of flows corresponding to pre-capitalist formations and a decoded axiomatic, there is a difference in nature, or is there simply a variation? There is a radical difference in nature**!** Capitalism cannot furnish any code.</p><p>We cannot say that the struggle against a system is totally independent of the manner in which this system was characterized. It is difficult to consider that the struggle of socialism against capitalism in the 19th century was independent of the theory of surplus value, in so far as this theory specified the characteristic of capitalism.</p><p>Suppose that capitalism can be defined as an economic machine excluding the codes and making decoded flows function by taking them into an axiomatic. This already permits us to bring together the capitalist situation and the schizophrenic situation. Even at the level of analysis that has a practical influence, the analysis of monetary mechanisms (the neocapitalist economists, this is schizophrenic) when we see how the monetary practice of capitalism works, at the concrete level, and not just in theory, its schizoid character, can we say that it is totally indifferent to revolutionary practice**?**</p><p>All that we are doing in relation to psychoanalysis and psychiatry comes down to what? Desire, or, it matters little, the unconscious: it is not imaginary or symbolic, it is uniquely machinic, and as long as you have not reached the region of the machine of desire, as long as you remain in the imaginary, the structural or the symbolic, you do not have a genuine hold on the unconscious. They are machines that, like all machines, are confirmed as such by their functioning. Confirmations: the painter [Richard] Lindner obsessed by “Boy with machine”, a huge little boy in the foreground holding a strange little machine, a kind of little kite and behind him, a big social technical machine and his little machine is plugged into the big one, in the background.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-01-15/#_edn4 rel=noopener>4</a> That is what I attempted last year to call the orphan unconscious, the true unconscious, the one that does not pass through daddy-mommy, the one that passes through delirious machines, these being in a given relation with the large social machines.</p><p>Second confirmation: an Englishman, W.G. Niederland, did research on Schreber’s father.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-01-15/#_edn5 rel=noopener>5</a> This is what I object to in the text of Freud: it is as if psychoanalysis was a veritable millstone which crushed the deepest character of the guy, namely, his social character… When we read Schreber, the Great Mongol, the Aryans, the Jews, etc. And when we read Freud, not a word about all this, it is as if it was just some manifest content and that one had to discover the latent content = the eternal daddy-mommy of Oedipus. All the political, politico-sexual, politico-libidinal content, because in the end, when Schreber père imagined himself to be a little Alsatian girl defending Alsace against a French officer, there is political libido here. It is sexual and political at the same time, the one in the other; we learn that Schreber was well-known because he had invented a system of education == Schreber Gardens. He had produced a system of universal pedagogy.</p><p>Schizoanalysis procedes in a direction that is the opposite of psychoanalysis, indeed, each time that the subject narrates something that brings her/him in the vicinity of Oedipus or castration, the schizo being analyzed says “Enough.” What he sees as important, is that: Schreber père invents a pedagogic system of universal value, that is not brought to bear on his own child, but globally: Pangymnasticon. If we suppress from the delirium [<em>delire</em>] of the son the politico-global dimension of the paternal pedagogic system, we can longer understand anything. The father does not supply a structural function, but a political system: I am saying that the libido passes through here, not through daddy and mommy, through the political system. In the Pangymnasticon, there are machines: no system without machines, a system, rigorously speaking, is a structural unity of machines, so much so that one must burst the system to reach the machines. And what are Schreber’s machines: they are sado-paranoiac machines, a type of delirious machine. They are sado-paranoiac in the sense that they are applied to children, preferably to little girls.</p><p>With these machines, the children stay calm; in this delirium, the universal pedagogic dimension clearly appears: it is not a delirium about his son, it is a delirium that he constructs about the formation of a higher race. Schreber père acts against his son, not as a father, but as a libidinal promoter of a delirious investment of the social field. It is no longer the paternal function, but rather that the father is there to make something delirious pass through. This is certain, but the father acts here as an agent of transmission in relation to a field that is not the familial field, but that is a political and historical field, once again, the names of history and not the name of the father.</p><p><strong>Georges Comtesse:</strong> We do not catch flies with vinegar, even if it’s machinic.</p><p><strong>Deleuze:</strong> Schreber père’s system had a global development (belts for good conduct). It was a big social machine, and it was, at the same time, sown in the social machine, full of little delirious sado-paranoiac machines. So too, in the delirium of the son, certainly it is papa, but as a representative of what authority does he intervene. He intervenes as an agent of transmission in a libidinal investment of a certain type of social formation. On the contrary, the drama of psychoanalysis is the eternal familialism that consists in referring the libido, and with it all sexuality, to the familial machine, and we can go on to structuralize it, it changes nothing, we remain within the closed circle of: symbolic castration, structuring function of the family, parental characters, and we continue to crush all the outside [<em>dehors</em>]. [Maurice] Blanchot: a new type of relation with the outside.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-01-15/#_edn6 rel=noopener>6</a></p><p>Yet, and this is the critical point, psychoanalysis tends to suppress any relation of itself and of the subject who has just been analyzed with the outside. On itself alone it pretends to reterritorialize us, onto the territoriality or onto the most mediocre earth, the most shabby, the oedipal territoriality, or worse, onto the couch. Here, we clearly see the relation of psychoanalysis and capitalism: if it is true that in capitalism, flows are decoded, are deterritorialized constantly, i.e. that capitalism produces the schizo like it produces money, the whole capitalist project [<em>tentative</em>] consists in reinventing artificial territorialities in order to reinscribe people, to vaguely recode them: they invent anything: HLM [<em>Habitation à Loyer Moyen</em>, i.e.: government-controlled housing], home, and there is familial reterritorialization, the family, it is after all the social cell, so they will reterritorialize the guy in a family (community psychiatry): they reterritorialize people there where all the territorialities are floating ones, they proceed through an artificial, imaginary, residual reterritorialization.</p><p>And psychoanalysis—classical psychoanalysis—fabricates familial reterritorialization, most of all by skipping over all that is effective in delirium, all that is aggressive in delirium, namely, that delirium is a system of politico-social investments, not just of any type: it is the libido that hooks itself onto political social determinations. Schreber is not dreaming at all when he makes love to his mother; he dreams when he is being raped like a little Alsacian girl by a French officer. This depends on something much deeper than Oedipus, namely, the manner in which the libido invests social formations, to the point that one must distinguish two types of social investments by desire: social investments of interests that are of the preconscious type, that, if necessary, pass through classes. And below these, not exactly in harmony with them, unconscious investments, the libidinal investments of desire.</p><p>Traditional psychoanalysis enclosed the libidinal investments of desire in the familial triangle and structuralism is the last attempt [<em>tentative</em>] to save Oedipus at the moment when Oedipus is coming apart at the seams.</p><p>The task of schizoanalysis is to see that parents play a role in the unconscious only as agents of interception, agents of transmission in a system of the flows of desire, of desiring machines, and what counts is my unconscious relation with my desiring machines. What are my own desiring machines, and, through them, the unconscious relation of these desiring machines with the large social machines with which they carry out…and that hence, there is no reason to support psychoanalysis in its attempt to reterritorialize us.</p><p>I take an example from [Serge] Leclaire’s last book [Démasquer le réel <em>(Paris: Seuil, 1971); see</em> Anti-Oedipus, <em>pp. 323-324</em>]; there is something that no longer works: “The most fundamental act in the history of psychoanalysis was a decentering that consisted in passing from the parents’ room as referent to the analytical office.” There was a time when we believed in Oedipus, and in the reality of seduction, it was not going strong even then, because the whole unconscious had been familiarized, a crushing of the libido onto daddy-mommy-me: the whole development of psychoanalysis was made in this direction [<em>sens</em>]: substitution of the phantasm for real seduction and substitution of castration for Oedipus. Leclaire: “To tell the truth, the displacement of the living kernel of the oedipal conjuncture, of the familial scene to the psychoanalytic scene, is strictly correlative to a sociological mutation in which we can psychoanalytically demarcate a recourse to the level of the familial institution,” page 30. The family is shabby: the unconscious protests and no longer works to triangulate itself, happily there is the analyst to serve as a relay.</p><p>It no longer supports the family, custody and the concealment [<em>dérobement</em>] of an all-powerful real. We say, ouf!, we will finally have a relation with the extra familial real, ha! no! says Leclaire, for that which serves as a relay for the family, and that which becomes the guardian, the unveiling veiling of the all-powerful real is the office of the analyst.</p><p>You can no longer triangulate, oedipalize in the family; it no longer works. You will come onto the couch to triangulate and oedipalize yourself. And indeed, adds Leclaire: “If the psychoanalytic couch has become the place where the confrontation with the real is unfolded.” The confrontation with the real does not take place on the earth, in the movement of territorialization, reterritorialization, of deterritorialization, it takes place on this rotten earth that is the couch of the analyst. “It is of no importance that the oedipal scene has no referent exterior to the office, that castration has no referent outside the office of the analyst,” which signifies that psychoanalysis, like capitalism, finds itself faced with the decoded flows of desire, finds itself before the schizophrenic phenomena of decoding and deterritorialization, has chosen to make for itself a little axiomatic. The couch, the ultimate earth of European man today, his very own little earth.</p><p>This situation of psychoanalysis tends to introduce an axiomatic excluding all reference, excluding all relation with the outside whatever it may be, appears as a catastrophic movement of interiority when it comes to understanding the true investments of desire. From the moment we seized upon the family as referent, it was all screwed up. The last earth, the couch that valorizes and justifies itself on its own terms. It was compromised from the beginning, from the moment when we cut desire off from the double dimension—what I call the double dimension of desire: and its relation, on the one hand, with desiring machines irreducible to any symbolic or structural dimension, to functional desiring machines, and the problem of schizoanalysis is to know how these desiring machines work, and to reach the level where they work in someone’s unconscious, which assumes that we will skip over Oedipus, castration, etc.</p><p>On the other hand, with social-political-cosmic investments, and here one must not say, that there would be any desexualization of the findings of psychoanalysis, for I am saying that desire, in its fundamental sexual form, can only be understood in its sexual investments. In so far as they do not bear on daddy-mommy, this is secondary, but in so far as they bear, on the one hand, on desiring machines, and on the other hand, in so far as they traverse our sexual, homosexual, heterosexual loves.</p><p>What is invested is always what cuts up [<em>des coupures</em>] of the dimensions of a historical social field, and certainly, the father and the mother play a role within it, they are agents of communication of desiring machines, on one hand of the machines with each other, and on the other hand, of the desiring machines with the large desiring machines.</p><p>Schizoanalysis is made up of three operations: A destructive task: skipping over the oedipal and castrating structures in order to reach a region of the unconscious where there is no castration etc., because desiring machines ignore this.</p><p>A positive task: That is to see and to analyze functionally, there is nothing to interpret = we do not interpret a machine, we grasp its functioning and its failures, the why of its failures: it is the oedipal collar, the psychoanalytic collar of the couch that introduces failures into desiring machines.</p><p>The third task: Desiring machines only work as long as they invest the social machines. And what are the types of libidinal investments, distinct from the preconscious investments of interests? These sexual investments — cross all the beings that we love, all our loves — it is a complex of deterritorialization and reterritorialization, that which we love. It is always a certain mulatto, a movement of deterritorialization and reterritorialization; it is not the scrawny and hysteric territoriality of the couch. And across each being that we love, what we invest is a social field; these are the dimensions of this social field, and the parents are agents of transmission in the social field.</p><p>See George Jackson’s letter,
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-01-15/#_edn7 rel=noopener>7</a> the classic black mother who says to her son, don’t fool around and marry well, make money. This classic mother here, is she acting like a mother and like an oedipal object of desire, or is she acting in such a way that she transmits a certain type of libidinal investment of the social field, namely the type that marries well, he makes love, and this in the strictest sense of the term, with something through his wife, unconsciously, with a certain number of economic, political, social processes? And that love has always been a means through which the libido attains something other than the beloved person, namely a whole cutting up [<em>découpage</em>] of the historical social field, ultimately we always make love with the names of history.</p><p>The other mother [of Jackson] — the one who says “grab your gun” — it follows that the two act as agents of transmission in a certain type of social-historical investment, that from one to the other the pole of these investments has singularly changed, that in one case, we can say that they are reactionary investments, at the limit fascist, in the other case, it is a revolutionary libidinal investment. Our loves are like the conduits and the pathways of these investments that are not, once again, of a familial nature, but of a historico-political nature. And the final problem of schizoanalysis is not only the positive study of desiring machines, but the positive study of the manner in which desiring machines carry out the investment of social machines, whether it be in forming investments of the libido of a revolutionary type, whether it be in forming libidinal investments of the revolutionary type.</p><p>The domain of schizoanalysis distinguishes itself at this moment from the domain of politics, in the sense that the preconscious political investments are investments of class interests that are determinable by certain types of studies. But these still do not tell us anything about the other type of investments, namely specifically libidinal investments — desire. To the point that it can happen that a preconscious revolutionary investment can be doubled by a libidinal investment of the fascist type = which explains how displacements are made from one pole of delirium to another pole of delirium, how a delirium has fundamentally two poles—which Artaud said so well: “the mystery of all is `Heliogabalus the Anarchist,” because these are the two poles. It is not only a contradiction; it is a fundamental human contradiction, namely a pole of unconscious investment of the fascist type, and an unconscious investment of the revolutionary type. What fascinates me in a delirium is the radical absence of daddy-mommy, except as agents of transmission, except as agents of interception for there they have a role. But on the other hand, the task of schizoanalysis is to release in delirium the unconscious dimensions of a fascist investment and a revolutionary investment, and at a certain point, it slips; at a certain point it oscillates, this is the deep domain of the libido.</p><p>In the most reactionary, most folkloric territoriality, a revolutionary ferment can surge forth — we never know — something schizo, something mad, a deterritorialization: the Basque problem. They did much for fascism; in other conditions, these same minorities could have determined — I am not saying this happens by chance — they could have secured a revolutionary role. It is extremely ambiguous: it is not at the level of political analysis, it is at the level of analysis of the unconscious: the way it whirls about [<em>comment ça tourne</em>]. (Maud Mannoni: antipsychiatry in the question of the court judgement on Schreber = a completely fascist delirium).
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-01-15/#_edn8 rel=noopener>8</a> If antipsychiatry has a sense, if schizoanalysis has a sense, it is at the level of an analysis of the unconscious, to tip delirium from the pole that is always present, the reactionary fascist pole that implies a certain type of libidinal investment, towards the other pole, no matter if it is hard and slow, the revolutionary pole.</p><p><strong>Richard Zheren:</strong> Why only two poles?</p><p><strong>Deleuze:</strong> We can make many, but fundamentally, there are clearly two great types of investment, two poles. The reference of libidinal investments is daddy-mommy; these are the territorialities, and the deterritorializations, this must be found in the unconscious, especially at the level of its loves. Phantasm of naturality: of a pure race, movement of the pendulum = revolutionary phantasm of deterritorialization.</p><p>If you’re saying that, on the analyst’s couch, what flows still flows, alright then. But the problem that I would pose here is: there are types of flow that pass beneath the door, what psychoanalysts call the viscosity of the libido, an overly viscous libido that does not let itself be grasped by the code of psychoanalysis, alright here yes, there is deterritorialization. But psychoanalysis says: negative reaction [<em>contre-indication</em>]. What annoys me in psychoanalysis of the Lacanian camp is the cult of castration.</p><p>The family is a system of transmission, the social investments of one generation passed on to another, but I absolutely do not think that the family is a necessary element in the making of social investments because, in any case, there are desiring machines that, on their own, constitute social libidinal investments of the large social machines. If you say: the madman is someone who remains with his desiring machines and who does not carry out social investments, I do not follow you. In all madness, I see an intense investment of a particular type of historical, political, social field, even in catatonic persons. This goes for adults as well as children, it is from earliest childhood that the desiring machines are plugged into the social field.</p><p>In themselves, all territorialities are equal to each other in relation to the movement of deterritorialization, but there is something like a schizoanalysis of territorialities, of their types of functioning. And by functioning, I understand the following: if the desiring machines are on the side of a great deterritorialization, i.e. on the path of desire beyond territorialities, if to desire is to be deterritorialized, one must say that each type of territoriality is able to support such or such a genre of machinic index: the machinic index is that which, in a territoriality, will be able to make it flee in the direction [<em>sens</em>] of a deterritorialization.</p><p>So, I take the example of the dream, from the point of view that I am attempting to explicate the role of machines, it is very important, different from that of psychoanalysis. When a plane flies or a sewing machine — the dream is a kind of little imaginary territoriality, sleep or a nightmare is a deterritorialization — we can say that deterritorialization and the reterritorialities only exist as a function of each other. But you can evaluate the force of a possible deterritorialization from the indexes on such or such a territoriality, i.e. how much it supports of a flow that flees. Flee and in fleeing, makes flee, not the others, but something from the system, a fragment.</p><p>A machinic index in a territoriality is what measures the power [<em>puissance</em>] of flight in this territoriality by making flows flee, in this regard all territorialities are not equal to each other. There are artificial territorialities; the more it flees and the more we can flee while fleeing, the more it is deterritorialized. Our loves are always situated on a territoriality that, in relation to us, deterritorializes us or else reterritorializes us. In this regard, there are misunderstandings + a whole game of investments that are the problem of schizoanalysis. Instead of having the family as a referent, it has as a referent the movements of deterritoralization and reterritorialization.</p><p><strong>Richard Zrehen:</strong> I want to say that you employed the term “code” for so-called primitive societies. While I think it is not possible to think of them in terms of code, because of the well-known mark, because there is a mark, which requires exchange, it is because there is a debt that we have an obligation to exchange. What happens from their society to ours, is the loss of the debt, so when you say that the schizo is the negative of the capitalist and that capitalism is the negative of primitive societies, it is evident exactly what is lost, it is castration.</p><p>With this mark of principle, you are anticipating what makes up capitalism while crossing out castration. What is foreclosed in capitalism is this initial mark and what Marx tried to do was to reintroduce the notion of debt. When you propose to me a reactionary pole of investments and a revolutionary pole, I say that you are already taking the concepts of “revolutionary” and of `reactionary as already instituted in a field that does not permit an appreciation of what you are trying to say. You are using breaks [<em>coupure</em>], I will certainly admit that Oedipus and castration are <em>dépassé</em>, but capitalism… [<em>End of the session</em>]</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p><a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-01-15/#_ednref1 rel=noopener>1</a> See <em>Anti-Oedipus,</em> trans.

Capitalism uses an axiomatic system to regulate these flows, but it also faces the threat of flows that escape its axioms and create a crisis.</li><li>Deleuze compares capitalism to schizophrenia, which is also a process of decoding and deterritorializing flows, but without letting itself be axiomatized or recoded. Schizophrenia is the negative of capitalism, which is itself the negative of all other societies. Schizophrenia expresses a desire that goes beyond the limits of capitalism and its codes.</li><li>Deleuze discusses some examples of decoded and deterritorialized flows in history, such as money, labor, women, etc. He also criticizes the psychoanalytic and structuralist approaches to these flows, which try to impose an Oedipal and castrating structure on them. He proposes instead a schizoanalysis that would analyze the functioning and investment of desiring machines in relation to social machines.</li></ul><blockquote><p>We have just seen the correlation between the notion of flux and five other notions: pole, code or accounting system, stage of transformation, sector and stock. If we try to simplify all of this, I think that the notion which I was attempting to launch last time may be able to concentrate or group together all of these five references, this notion being that of the break-flow. For this notion of the break-flow has to be understood simultaneously in two ways: it is to be understood as the very correlation of flux and code, and if, returning once more to capitalism, we are aware that flows are “accounted for”, it is in favour of a movement of decoding such that the accounting system has simply taken the place of codes; it is at this point that we come to realize that it’s no longer sufficient to speak of an accounting system, but rather of a financing system or structure.</p></blockquote><p>As previously, this session begins in progress, and its brief length indicates that this only a fragment of a longer session. Deleuze starts by suggesting the need to define flows more clearly in order to render an initial system of concepts related to flows and their interruption as social investment of desire. Deleuze’s development yields additional concepts, in rates of transformation, sectors, and stocks, and he indicates that the utility of stocks varies with each case, and yet they maintain linkages through flows which yield movements of value between the poles (cf. <em>Anti-Oedipus</em> ch. III, sections 9 & 10). Deleuze proposes to focus on the notion of break-flow, a notion emergiing both as a break-subtraction of flow and break-detachment of code, which Deleuze calls the mechanism of delirium in the double schizz operation. Deleuze suggests that the economic operation of coding flows entails the double break-flow operations, with capitalism’s formation as madness in its pure state, yet also the opposite of madness, at once producing decoded flows, and yet establishing itself on that which terrified all other social formations. Here lies the deep link between capitalism and schizophrenia, the decoding of flows, yet also capitalism’s harsh repression of madness for this very reason. Deleuze then shifts to a detailed historical presentation of this unfolding linkage, starting with Marx’s depiction of the Asiatic state, demonstrating the radical contingency of capital’s formation, its generalized decoding of flows yet also an apparatus for conjugating such flows. The session ends with an interruption as Deleuze, describing the merchant capitalists’ seizure of production by turning associations of producers into sub-contractors, follows Marx toward a second aspect of this movement, which is cut off.</p><p>(the lecture starts from here)</p><p>… I would like to pursue the problem of the economy of flows; last time, someone wanted a more precise definition of flows, more precise, that is, than something which flows upon the socius. What I call the socius is not society, but rather a particular social instance which plays the role of a full body. Every society presents itself as a socius or full body upon which all kinds of flows flow and are interrupted, and the social investment of desire is this basic operation of the break-flow to which we can easily give the name of schizz. It is not yet important for us to have a real definition of flows, but it is important, as a starting point, to have a nominal definition and this nominal definition must provide us with an initial system of concepts.</p><p>As a point of departure for our search for a nominal definition of flows, I’ll take a recent study by a specialist in the flows of political economy: <em>Flows and stocks</em> by Daniel Antier.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-02-13/#_edn1 rel=noopener>1</a> Stocks and flows are two primary notions in modern political economy, remarked upon by [J.M.] Keynes, such that we find in Keynesian economy the first great theory of flows in his <em>General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money</em> [1936]. Antier informs us that, “from the economic point of view, we can call flows the values of the quantities of goods and services or money that are transmitted from one pole to another”; the first concept to be placed in relation with that of flows is that of pole: a flow, inasmuch as it flows on the socius, enters by one pole and exits by another.</p><p>At our last session, we had tried to show that flows implicated codes, in the sense that a flow could be called economic insofar as something passed, and where something else blocked it and made it pass; the example given was that of the rules of alliance in so-called primitive societies, where taboos represent a blockage of the flow of possible marriages; the first permitted marriages, i.e. the first permitted incests, called preferential unions, which are, in fact, hardly ever realized, represent something like the first modes of passage: something passes, something is blocked (this blockage taking the form of incest taboos), something passes, the preferential unions, something blocks it and makes it pass, for example the maternal [<em>utérine</em>] uncle. There is, in any case, the determination of an incoming and of an outgoing flow; the notion of a pole implicates or is implicated in the movement of flows, and this takes us back to the idea that something flows, that something is blocked, that something makes it flow, that something blocks the flow.</p><p>Antier continues: “In the knowledge that the term pole will be given to an individual or a firm, or alternately a group of individuals or group of firms, or even a fraction of a firm…” — Here are defined the interceptors of flows… when the operations carried out by these – “the interceptions of flows can be described by a coherent accounting system…” Thus, a correlative of the notion of flow is that of an accounting system; when the operation carried out – such as the passage of a flow from one pole to another – may be described by a coherent system, this evidently being expressed in terms of capitalism, by which I mean that in this context we are in the framework of capitalism at the level of abstract quantities, as the final residue of something that has an entirely different scope in pre-capitalist societies, to wit, what in pre-capitalist societies present themselves as veritable codes. It’s when a society is completely decoded that flows are prone to incorporation into an accounting system, that is, into an axiomatic of abstract quantities instead of referring to qualified codes; the accounting system under capitalism is the residue of quantities, abstracted from the coding of flows, and capitalism functions on the basis of decoded flows, from which point on these flows are taken up by a system based on accounting.</p><p>Antier continues: “…We can consider all goods arriving at the same level of material or legal transformation at the precise moment at which they arrive as constituting one and the same flow…” Here you have a third correlative notion: material or legal transformation, “and if one is speaking of flows that are exchanged between industrial sectors, one must specify the notion of sector, if one is interested in precisely determining the flow of production, the flow of revenues, the flow of consumption, then one has to determine these terms carefully; take for example the flow of monetary revenue reached by calculating the totals of all liquid assets…”</p><p>The question is, what is meant by ‘all liquid assets’ [<em>tous les biens en monnaie</em>]? This is what economists refer to as nominal salaries – a concept that covers real wages, as well as management salaries and dividends (interest on assets). Take for example the flow of cash revenues [<em>flux de revenus monétaires</em>]: this is determined by the total of all liquid assets at the disposal of all of the individuals making up the collectivity, where the revenue of a large number of individuals can be precisely evaluated since it is paid out by other individuals, such as state contractors, and since it has been precisely calculated; but for many kinds of revenue the importance of which must not be undervalued, one can’t give an exact definition; well, well, so there’s a sphere of indetermination in the sector?</p><p>This is doubtless related to something very profound in what is, as we shall see, the accounting sector; but, for all that, we now have a triple reference: the flows refer for one thing to poles and for another to codes or accounting systems, then – in fourfold fashion – to rates of transformation, next to sectors and finally to stocks. This amounts to five correlative notions. From an economic viewpoint we will refer to stocks of goods and monetary stocks, as the goods held and the money held by only one pole; the flow, then, is what flows from one pole to another, what goes in and what goes out, and the stock is what is brought back as the material and legal possession of one of the poles considered; this clearly shows the correlative character of the two notions.</p><p>We can thus define stocks in the following way: the utility of stocks changes from case to case, but is linked in one way or another, at one time or another, to the existence of flows — we will, nevertheless, receive the distinct impression that stocks and flows are effectively the same thing as they relate to two different units: first, the passage from one pole to the other, and secondly, attribution to one of the two poles, as two units of measure for one and the same thing. — The utility of stocks varies with every given case, but is linked in one way or another, and at one time or another, to the existence of flows; and yet, whereas flows allow one to extract the movements of values between different poles, stocks represent a sum of values that are at the disposal of a given pole; there are no goods related to a stock which are not, at a specified time, also correlated to a flow; this is, in fact, one of the fundamental principles of accounting, because the influx and output of a stock constitute flows; only the study of flows allows one to realize the role of the incoming and outgoing movements involved in stock variations.</p><p>So, we have just seen the correlation between the notion of flux and five other notions: pole, code or accounting system, stage of transformation, sector and stock. If we try to simplify all of this, I think that the notion which I was attempting to launch last time may be able to concentrate or group together all of these five references, this notion being that of the break-flow. For this notion of the break-flow has to be understood simultaneously in two ways: it is to be understood as the very correlation of flux and code, and if, returning once more to capitalism, we are aware that flows are “accounted for”, it is in favour of a movement of decoding such that the accounting system has simply taken the place of codes; it is at this point that we come to realize that it’s no longer sufficient to speak of an accounting system, but rather of a financing system or structure.</p><p>The strict correlation of flux and code implies, apparently, that in a society – and this is clearly our point of departure – it’s impossible to seize flows other than by and through the operation which codes them; the fact is that a non-coded flow is, strictly speaking, an unnamable or merely a thing. This is what I was getting at last time, this is the terror of society – it is the flood, the deluge which is the flow that breaks through the barriers of codes. Societies aren’t exactly in mortal dread because everything is coded – the family is coded, death is coded; but what makes societies panic is when something or other breaks down, something that forces the codes to crack. A flow is thus not recognizable as an economic and social flow except by and through the code which encodes it.</p><p>And this operation of coding implies two simultaneous interruptions, and it is this simultaneity which allows us to define the notion of a break-flow: simultaneously, in an operation of coding the flows, a subtraction [<em>prélèvement</em>] from the flows is produced, due to the code, and this subtraction from the flows defines its poles: it defines a certain entry point and a certain exit, and it is between the two that the break-subtraction takes place; this occurs at the same time as the code itself relates to a break of another sort which is strictly simultaneous, meaning once more that… there is no subtraction from a flow which is not accompanied by a detachment of or from the code which encodes this flow, although it is the simultaneity of the subtraction of the flow and the detachment of a segment of code that permits one to define the flow with reference to poles, sectors, rates and stocks. This notion of a break-flow presents itself in two-fold fashion, for it implies at once a break-subtraction of a flow and a break-detachment of a code. Here you’ve got the mechanism of delirium: it’s this double schizz operation — it’s the schizz which consists both in an operation of subtractions of flow as a function of detachments of code, and vice versa.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-02-13/#_edn2 rel=noopener>2</a></p><p>If, to begin, I take an indeterminate flow as a purely nominal starting point, then what flows on the socius, cannot appear socially speaking as a flow, except in correlation to a code, or at least to an accounting system, and the flow itself is qualified as a function of the code, and the correlation of the two is where you have a break-subtraction on this flow itself (as qualified by the code), at the same time as and in reaction to which you have a break-detachment of the code. A detachment of code is correlative to a subtraction of flow. This is simply a formal description.</p><p>At first glance, a madman is someone who passes on the unnamable, who carries decoded flows: “a god speaks to me, but it’s not your god”. The Greeks had a notion of the demon, they had gods and the gods were allotted, everything was very properly allocated, they had powers and spaces; in a way, they couldn’t move, they were sedentary, they had their territory and the demons carried out the coding. Religions are not to be understood from an ideological viewpoint, but at the level of their pertaining to a social code. Demons were above all powers which did not respect the codes. In <em>Oedipus</em> there is a text which is badly translated, and which reads, “which demon has leapt the longest leap,” a text which frankly leaps beyond the limits, it had to do with unnamable powers, with excess, and it is not forcing things to translate this as “decoding”. Thus, a demon speaks in a certain way so that a madman receives decoded flows, and in turn emits decoded flows, such that it flows and escapes on all sides, messing up all the codes. Which is why in Oedipus’ case, it just won’t stick, because literally, Oedipus is a screwed-up code.</p><p>When something goes bad, you always have to go back up to a higher level to see where things start to go bad (cf. the USSR), and psychoanalysis goes bad, but why and how so? Derrida has seen very clearly in what way psychoanalysis, at least at the level of its first intentions, is opposed to the code; it is in fact a system of decoding, and this is why this affair just couldn’t help going bad.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-02-13/#_edn3 rel=noopener>3</a> Because decoding means either to read a code, to penetrate the secret of a code, or else it means to decode in an absolute sense, i.e. to destroy the codes in order to make the flows flow freely; a major part of the project of psychoanalysis was intended as an absolute decoding of the flows of desire and not as a relative decoding, to make the walls of the code cave in, and to make the flows of desire run wild.</p><p>It is in this sense that psychoanalysis was very close to a desiring economy, and properly speaking, to desiring-machines, the producers of the flows of desire; and this is seen very clearly in Freud’s writings, such as <em>The Interpretation of Dreams</em>, where he says: what distinguishes my method from the method of the key of dreams? The major difference is that the key of dreams proposes a code of desire; Freud says that they have seen everything, but that they propose a systematic coding : this means that, that is the key of dreams; and from the perspective of a key of dreams, if one decodes the dream, one decodes it in a relative sense, i.e. one discovers the cipher of its code. Now Freud says that psychoanalysis has nothing to do with all of that, that it does not interpret. And Derrida, in his article on Freud in <em>Writing and</em> <em>Difference</em> shows this very well. It carries out an absolute decoding, rendering the codes as flows in the raw state, and thereby psychoanalysis is opposed to codes. It goes without saying that, at the same time, and from the outset, they are inventing a new code, that is, the oedipal code which is even more of a code than any other code; thus, the flows of desire pass into the oedipal code, or else, whatever the flow of desire, it is stuffed into the oedipal grid. At this stage, psychoanalysis proves less and less capable of understanding madness, for the madman is really the being of decoded flows.</p><p>And who has shown this in a most vital and convincing way if not [Samuel] Beckett, whose strange creatures spend their time decoding things, they make non-codable flows pass. Social processes can’t capture flows except in relation to codes which operate on them, and which are simultaneously a detachment of a flow and a subtraction of chains or codes, and the madman makes flows pass on it, flows from which it is no longer possible to detach anything; there are no more codes, there is a chain of decoded flows, but one can’t cut into it. There is a sort of deluge or failure of the body, maybe that’s it, after all, the body-without-organs, when on the body, or from the body flows enter and exit by way of poles, flows on which one can no longer carry out any subtraction because there are no longer any codes from which to detach anything.</p><p>The state of the body of someone who has undergone a fairly severe operation, the eyes of this patient are the eyes of someone who has not been very far from death, who has not been very far from madness, the eyes are elsewhere in a certain sense – he has gone through the wall. It is interesting that what we call convalescence is a kind of return. He’s had a brush with death, it is an experience of the body, very strange, psychoanalysis: why does Freud cling so strongly to the notion of a death instinct? He tells his secret in “Inhibition, Symptom and Anxiety.” [1926] It seems that if there is a death instinct, it’s because there is neither a model nor an experience of death. When pressed, he admits that there is a model of birth but not of death, thus, all the more reason to make of it a transcendent instinct. Bizarre. Perhaps the model of death could be something like the body-without-organs.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-02-13/#_edn4 rel=noopener>4</a></p><p>Horror-story writers have understood, after Edgar Allen Poe, that death wasn’t the model for schizophrenic catatonia, but that the contrary was true, and that the catatonic was the one who made of his body a body-without-organs, a decoded body, and that on such a body there is a kind of nullification of the organs.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-02-13/#_edn5 rel=noopener>5</a> On this decoded body, flows can flow under conditions where they can no longer be decoded. This is why we fear decoded flows – the deluge; because once flows have been decoded, you can no longer subtract anything or break into them, no more than you can detach segments from any codes in order to dominate, orient or direct the flows.</p><p>And the experience of one who has been operated on, of her body-without-organs, is that, on this body, there are literally noncodable flows which constitute a thing, an unnamable thing. At the very moment that she breathes, there is great confusion of the flows that form one great indivisible flow, no longer susceptible to subtractions, one can no longer interrupt it. One long stream that cannot be tamed, where all of the flows that are usually distinguished by their codes are united in one and the same indivisible flow all flowing on one and the same non-differentiated body, the body without organs. And as for the mad patient who has undergone an operation, every breath of air he takes is at the same time a breath of spittle, a flow of air and spit that tend to get mixed up together, so that there are no longer any distinctions. Moreover, each time that he breathes and spits, he feels a vague desire to defecate, a vague erection: it’s the body-without-organs that escapes on every side. It is sad, but then again, it has moments of great joy, mixing up all the codes, it has its great moments, and this is what makes Beckett a comic writer.</p><p>Though here again, one can’t help saying, and then, and then, though this is what constitutes the madman and his place in society, as the place of one through whom all of the decoded flows pass, which is why he is perceived as the fundamental danger. The madman doesn’t decode in the sense that he would harbour a secret the meaning of which ordinary people have forgotten, but rather he decodes in the sense that he sits in his little corner and makes little machines which make the flows pass and which make social codes break down. The schizophrenic process as such, of which a schizo is only the schizophrenic continuation, well that schizophrenic process is a revolutionary potential in itself, in opposition to paranoid investments which are fundamentally of a fascist type.</p><p>This leads to a first result, namely, that the economic operation of coding flows involves a double break-flow, a break-detachment and a break-subtraction; and on the socius of a society one encounters these strange creatures, the mad, who make all of these decoded flows carry on. The strangest phenomenon of world history is the formation of capitalism because, in a certain sense, capitalism is madness in its pure state, and in another sense, it is likewise the opposite of madness. Capitalism is the only social formation which presupposes, as its condition of emergence, the breakdown of all preceding codes. In this sense, the flows of capitalism are decoded flows, and this poses the following problem: how could a society, with of all of its repressive formations, create itself on the basis of what constituted the terror of all other social formations: namely, the decoding of flows.</p><p>The intimate bond between capitalism and schizophrenia consists in their common basis and installation on decoded flows (insofar as they are decoded). How then was this decoding carried out? One has to keep the following two requirements clearly in mind: the basic affinity between schizophrenia and capitalism, but, at the same time, find in this basic affinity the reason for which the repression of madness under capitalism is conducted with much greater harshness and specificity than under pre-capitalist formations. In the one case there is a political economy and a libidinal economy, and, in the other, an economy of decoded flows.</p><p>I’d like to show that, historically, this shift took place over a long period of time: there are synchronic social machines and there are diachronic social machines; despotic Asiatic social machines are of a truly synchronic nature – Marx’s Asiatic state emerges in one blow, and all of the cogs and wheels of its state apparatus appear synchronically. The formation of the capitalist machine extends over many centuries. It’s a diachronic machine and has taken two long periods to come about; it isn’t capitalism that decodes the flows, rather, they are decoded on what we call the ruin and decline of great empires, and feudalism is only one of the forms of this ruin and decline. Capitalism does not proceed from the decoding of flows because it presupposes them, it presupposes flows that have lost their codes.</p><p>Marx is the author who has demonstrated the radical contingency of the formation of capital. Any history of philosophy is either theological, or else it is the history of contingencies and unforeseen encounters. The originary phenomenon of capitalism is this: decoded flows qua decoded flows must enter into conjunction. What then assures that this conjunction will take place? Here, one feels that history can teach us as much about the process of the decoding of flows, as about what ensures the conjunction of the decoded flows as such, and this can be nothing else than the processes of a specific historic sector. This tale of capitalism implies a generalized decoding of flows and at the same time something else, as if what ought to be put in place were an apparatus for conjugating decoded flows.</p><p>This is what gives capitalism its purely illusory appearance of liberalism. It has in fact never been liberal, it has always been state capitalism. This tale begins in Portugal in the 12th century, this tale of state capitalism. There has never been a time when flows were decoded and when everything was free, bringing recuperation, which is an awful thing. If it’s true that capitalism replaces the old ruined codes with conjugating machines, and axiomatic machines which are infinitely more cruel, crueler than the cruelest despot, although of another cruelty, it is at the same time as the decoding takes place [<em>que ça se décode</em>] that it is taken up by another machine which is a machine for conjugating decoded flows; whence capitalism’s affinity with schizophrenia, for it is based on decodings, and its opposition to schizophrenia, because instead of making the decoded flows pass, it blocks them in another way, and it makes them enter into a machine for conjugating decoded flows.</p><p>Take an example from the history of painting, the very bizarre history of the Venetian School: it is marked very late by the so-called Byzantine style, while Venice itself was already very advanced in mercantile capitalism, but this merchant and banking capitalism remained entirely nestled in the pores of the old despotic society. And all of Christianity at that time finds something like its pictorial form in these pyramidal structures, literally, in hierarchical mode, which respond to despotic overcoding. These Byzantine paintings of the Venetian school continue until the middle of the 15th century.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-02-13/#_edn6 rel=noopener>6</a></p><p>Here you have this beautiful Byzantine style, and what do you see? – overcoded Christianity, Christianity interpreted according to the style and the manner of overcoding: there is an old despot, there is the father, there’s Jesus and there are the tribes of the Apostles. In one of Delphiore’s paintings, there are rows of pyramids which are spread in fine rows facing straight ahead. It is not just the people who are coded and overcoded in Byzantine art, it is also their organs which are coded, coded and overcoded, under the great unifying influence of the despot, whether this despot is God or the father or whether he is the great Byzantine Emperor. We get the impression that their organs are the object of a collective hierarchic investment. It would be mad for a Virgin to be looking to the right while baby Jesus was looking the other way. You’ve got to be mad to invent something like that; you couldn’t do something like that under a regime where organs are collectively invested, are coded by the collectivity and are overcoded.</p><p>Under Christianity, the codes are mixed up, but this is because despotic codes coexist with territorial codes, and the colors themselves enter into the pictorial code. And if, in a museum, you change rooms, you will discover something else altogether, it is a great joy and a great anxiety too, for they are in the process of decoding the flows, a process which doesn’t coincide with the explosion of capitalism but comes quite a bit later. The great decoding of the flows of painting takes place around 1450, right in mid-15th century, and it’s a kind of radical break: all of a sudden we see the hierarchy of overcoding breaking down, the ruin of the territorial codes, the flows of painting go insane too, destroying all of the codes, a flow passes. We get the impression that painters – occupying their usual position amongst artists in relation to the social system – create Christs that are totally queer, they are totally mannerist Christs, it’s all sexualized, they create Virgins who stand in for all women, and baby boys who have just nursed, little boys pooping, they really play at this process of decoding flows of colour.</p><p>And how does this happen? Everything happens as if, for the first time, the characters represented became the owners of their own organs: the collective hierarchic codification of organs, the social investment of organs is done with; from now on the Virgin and every other character will, literally, start to run their own affair; in fact the painting escapes on all sides: the Virgin looks to one side, there are two guys looking at baby Jesus, a third is looking on as if something were happening, there are scenes in the background and the picture explodes in all directions so that every one starts possessing their own organs. They are not insane, there is one member of the Venetian School who makes a creation of the world that is incredible: generally the creation of the world ‘a la Byzantine’ was done according to a hierarchy; there was a kind of cone or big pyramid of the despotic order and at the very bottom, the territorial codes. The creation of the world that interests me is a departure from this: there is God the Father up in the sky in the position of a runner, and he gives a starting signal; in front of him are ducks and chickens who are racing away as fast as they can, and in the sea there are fish who are also racing away, and God is the one who sends it all away, it is the end of all the codes.</p><p>And what do they do with the body of Christ? The body of Christ is useful as a body without organs; so they machine it in every way and direction, they make it amorous, suffering, tortured, but you can feel that it is joyous. The perspective, you see, the perspective, that’s nothing, a useless trick; those who have done without it, it’s because they didn’t need it, they had other problems. Perspective is lines of flight and can only be useful in a painting of decoding, but it is very secondary, it doesn’t even count in the organization of a painting. So what are they trying to do, we’re going to cut low along Christ’s hip, we’re going to make a mannerist Christ, all the tortured bodies are good bodies without organs, Saint Sebastian with his arrows sticking out in all directions.</p><p>Once again, in this overthrowing of the pictorial system, perspective is only a little thing. The generalized decoding of flows has to be taken up again by something other than a code, and in effect, there is no longer a pictorial code, but instead a strange sort of pictorial machine that conjoins and that will give rise to the unity of the picture, no longer a signifying unity of a code or overcode, but a system of echoes, of repetitions, of oppositions, of symmetries, a veritable conjugating machine, where flows of colors and decoded features are conjugated. There emerges a real pictorial axiomatic that replaces the failing codes. Capitalism doesn’t arise by means of the simple decoding of flows, for it does not appear until such time as flows, inasmuch as they are decoded, enter into conjunction with one another.</p><p>Marx has said that when this happens it proves his great theory of contingency. In Rome, as at the end of feudalism, the decoding of flows brought in a new kind of slavery and not at all capitalism. For what had to take place was the meeting of the flow of decoded capital and that of deterritorialized labor. Why did this encounter take place? Refer to Marx’s notion of primitive accumulation, on one condition and that is that primitive accumulation, this can be a dangerous thing, if we say: oh yes, primitive accumulation, this is what served to fuel the process of accumulation, and we might as well say the formation of stocks at the beginning of capitalism. One has to see that primitive accumulation is called primitive to distinguish it from other types of accumulation, not primitive because it comes first.</p><p>The way capitalism functions, even if we are talking about its industrial essence, is the way banking and trading work, and we must hold that capitalism is essentially industrial, although it only functions through its banking system and through its trade circuits. Why? There is a kind of conjunction: capital starts to take control of production, but is it the first time? No. So, we take up Marx’s analysis again, an analysis which Marx insists on: the control of production by capital has existed in a certain guise from the beginning, but it appears in another guise with capitalism. I mean to say that even from the perspective of banking and mercantile capitalism, the banks and merchants create a monopoly for themselves: there is at the outset of capitalism, the way in which English mercantile capitalism forbids foreign capitalists from buying wool and woollen cloth; in that case, this exclusive clause is the means whereby the local merchant capitalists ensure that they control production because the producers can only sell through them.</p><p>So, we have to mark two times: a first time where merchant capitalists, in England for example, make the producers work for them by means of a system of delegation whereby the producer becomes a sort of sub-contractor, and this is where commercial capital directly takes possession of production; it is the great historic moment when merchant capital declared war on the leagues, i.e. the associations of producers. It’s a war between producers who looked with trepidation upon their being in the service of merchant capital, and merchant capital which, on the contrary, was trying to obtain greater and greater control of production via this sub-contracting method.</p><p>But it would take, as Marx declared, a second time … [<em>End of the session</em>]</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p><a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-02-13/#_ednref1 rel=noopener>1</a> Although this work is in neither <em>Anti-Oedipus</em> nor <em>A Thousand Plateaus,</em> the reference is to Daniel Antier, <em>L’Étude des flux et des stocks</em> (Paris: SEDES, 1957).</p><p><a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-02-13/#_ednref2 rel=noopener>2</a> On the breaks and schizz operation, see <em>Anti-Oedipus</em>, trans.

Capitalism uses an axiomatic system to regulate these flows, but it also faces the threat of flows that escape its axioms and create a crisis.</li><li>Deleuze compares capitalism to schizophrenia, which is also a process of decoding and deterritorializing flows, but without letting itself be axiomatized or recoded. Schizophrenia is the negative of capitalism, which is itself the negative of all other societies. Schizophrenia expresses a desire that goes beyond the limits of capitalism and its codes.</li><li>Deleuze discusses some examples of decoded and deterritorialized flows in history, such as money, labor, women, etc. He also criticizes the psychoanalytic and structuralist approaches to these flows, which try to impose an Oedipal and castrating structure on them. He proposes instead a schizoanalysis that would analyze the functioning and investment of desiring machines in relation to social machines.</li></ul><blockquote><p>Our entire hypothesis is, on the contrary, that the social field is invested by a sexual libido as such and that this is even the fundamental activity of the libido: to feed these unconscious investments of desire of the social field. Why does this pass through the individual’s sexuality? Here, there’s a hypothesis that is crucial – and that does not correspond at all to the inverse rapport introduced by Freud – as the field of consciousness being entirely filled with preconscious investments of interest of the social field; underneath, the true libidinal investments of the social field… can manifest themselves only within the set of erotic sexual relations and within the conception that an individual and a group, or a group, make of sexuality itself.</p></blockquote><p>Deleuze considers psychoanalysis as related to economics, predominantly material from chapters II and III. He begins with social investments of the unconscious, particularly as related to libidinal investments, a linkage disconnected by Freud, whereas for schizo-analysis, the libido’s primary function is to fuel the social field’s unconscious investments of desire, and schizo-analysis emphasizes rich-and-poor as apprehension of class struggle by unconscious desire, as a nonfamilial Other, thus rendering the family exterior to this process. Deleuze maintains that the traditional perspective is a race towards death, desire choked off, and the Oedipal framework focusing on the triangle father-mother-me, thereby creating an Oedipal-narcissist machine, eliding any fourth term (which would be the phallus, missing in place). Deleuze focuses on how Freud constructed this emphasis on familialism and toward the death drive, comparing this construction to how certain proponents of anti-psychiatry remain stuck in familialism, emphasizing the need to sever the linkage between desire and the family. Shifting to an economic perspective, Deleuze emphasizes the fundamental linkage between schizophrenia and the capitalist machine’s schizo mode of functioning, and he recalls the previous session’s discussion of the schizo’s channeling of decoded flows in contrast to the neurotic’s grounding within Oedipal recoding. Deleuze pursues an economic analysis of the two heterogeneous flows, constant capital and variable capital, as mechanisms of capitalism, leading to the distinction of money of exchange and credit money. After an unspecified question about economics, the truncated session ends with Deleuze raising additional distinctions about the types of money in banking circuit and the credit domain.</p><p>(lecture starts from here)</p><p>… What Toul [Prison]’s Dr. [Edith] Rose is doing goes further than denouncing an institution; it turns out she’s denouncing the authorities behind the institution. Hence why, like she can’t take anymore, she kind of breaks one of the system’s unwritten rules, i.e., that anything said to a psychiatrist never leaves the room. She goes over a lot of things—an epileptic locked and chained in solitary confinement for eight days—things newspapers had only glossed over. Denouncing the institution in general… The GIP [Prison Information Group] has been rallying support for Dr. Rose from psychiatrists and analysts.</p><p>There’s something I’d like to come back to. Last year, I tried to argue that social investments are what the libido is working with.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-03-11/#_edn1 rel=noopener>1</a> So far as the libido is concerned, parents only figure in as either agents of production or agents of anti-production—they never come in at the level of the unconscious. The unconscious is ignorant of parents; the idea of an unconscious libidinal investment of the social field implies a clear distinction between investments of the social field we should think of as the preconscious investment of interests and a completely different type of investments: the unconscious investments of desire, or libidinal investments. Something that initially bothered me in Freud’s writings is the way in which he establishes a kind of inverse relationship between sexual investment and social investment. There are clear-cut moments in the Schreber case where Freud writes: you know, social investment implies a desexualization—the unfortunate concept of sublimation—And the social field as such is resexualized only in the case of regression. And that’s how he interprets the whole social aspect of Judge Schreber’s delirium, i.e., that it’s a regression undoing desexualization, the original sublimation. Our whole assumption, on the other hand, is that the social field is invested by a sexual libido as such, and that that’s actually the libido’s primary function: to fuel the social field’s unconscious investments of desire.</p><p>Where does individual sexuality come in? Here, there’s already an assumption—one that doesn’t line up with the inverse relationship Freud suggests: since the field of consciousness is entirely filled by the social field’s preconsciously invested interests—beneath the real libidinal investments of the social field, investments of desire that don’t necessarily coincide with the preconscious investments of interests—they can only manifest across erotic sexual relations and in the way individuals and groups conceptualize sexuality itself, i.e., that it [<em>missing</em>] mean just anything, taking Marx’s well-known expression literally, where the relationship between man and woman offers a way of measuring his [<em>sic</em>] relationship with his fellow man [<em>sic</em>]. In other words, unconscious libidinal investments in the social field only appear through the series of a person’s or group’s lovers, series of sexual relationships, and in that sense it’s really true that libidinal or sexual investment, through its erotic objects, invests an entire social field. And not for the sake of desexualization—it throws everything up in the air.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-03-11/#_edn2 rel=noopener>2</a></p><p>Yet, in concrete terms, in his writing, there’s something rather curious in Freud, completely in line with the bourgeois families he’s describing, and it has to do with the role of maids. Roughly speaking, this comes either from Freud himself or from one of his cases.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-03-11/#_edn3 rel=noopener>3</a> The first basic feature: when he discovers the Oedipus complex, it’s in relation—he says so himself
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-03-11/#_edn4 rel=noopener>4</a>—it’s in relation to his own situation; it’s funny, when it comes to his childhood, folks always bring up his father and mother. Really, there are two key figures: a maid who gets accused of theft, and a half-brother who has the maid locked up, who has the maid “locked up,” as he puts it. So, there’s a link between this half-brother and the maid. That alone is enough to break down any pseudo-Oedipal structure because it turns out the half-brother goes to live in Manchester, and that’s the rich side of the family.</p><p>Right away, I’d like to point out how Freud, per his psychoanalytical custom, has always oedipalized that, i.e., projecting it [<em>rabattre</em>] onto daddy-mommy—meaning that he only ever depicts his half-brother as a stand-in for his father and the maid as representing his mother. That might well be—that’s not for me to say—but I think it was a tough decision for Freud, when he was discovering Oedipus, faced with a context where the libido obviously didn’t just fill in familial roles but social agents of projection or social agents of enunciation—the maid and the half-brother—that option was on the table, where the libido was an unconscious investment of the social field rooted in a childhood divide between Rich-Poor. A possible direction he was aware of—we’ll see—he represses it, he sublimates it for the sake of a wholly familial, oedipal interpretation. Freud’s arguments always, constantly allude to or even directly cast the theme of rich-and-poor in terms of unconscious libidinal investment—in the Rat Man, for example. In what he’s so beautifully written in “The Neurotic’s Individual Myth,” Lacan is the first to underscore how significant this theme was even in childhood, the choice between rich woman and poor woman in the case of the Rat Man, rooted in a running theme throughout the Rat Man’s case, i.e., this sort of circulating debt, a circulating debt which the Rat Man libidinally invests around the two poles of rich woman and poor woman.</p><p>In the Wolf man, the same sort of problem: the Wolf Man invests heavily in a maid he saw as a child washing the floor on her hands and knees, and this poor woman’s position gives rise to an incredibly powerful investment that has a part in determining his adult sexuality. What does Freud say? He waffles between two positions, but we can tell he’s already made up his mind—the first option is that the libido invests class determinations the child only apprehends empirically in the form of wealth-or-poverty. And what does the middle-class Wolf Man do, according to Freud? Having caught the maid on the floor, he develops a life-long habit of debasing women, as if all women belonged on the side of the poor woman. At once debasement and love. If we take that route—and we’re not used to hearing Freud speak this way—there’s only one way out: recognizing that libidinal or sexual investment, insofar as it is sexual, doesn’t invest familial determinations at all, but through family arrangements, invests social divides from one’s social field.</p><p>But that’s not what he wants, and in these passages, he tells us that the tendency to debase women and view every woman as a poor woman is only a rationalization. We can see when Freud moves in one direction, explores it for a bit and then no, he says, I was only trying to show how that was a dead end. He says that has nothing to do with the Wolf Man’s habit of debasing women because the child, he claims, identifies servants helping him as his mother insofar as they show him affection. We’re seeing the detours and doubts of a brilliant mind play out in real time: he almost goes one way and then ends up turning back. You know why the child invested his maid on all fours: it’s because—recalling the famous thesis affording him his bizarre oedipal reduction—because he had previously caught his mother in the same position. Not washing the floor, but in a sexual position with his father. Which means the fact that the woman scrubbing the floor is poor no longer matters; that rationalization comes second to the daddy-mommy investment—the only investment.</p><p>A third kind of passage—A bourgeois family in the 19th century, it’s easy to see why maids come up in Freud’s writing; what might he say about us today, when many families have their children looked after by Portuguese women, who have children of their own? My first question is whether the child, small as they are, confuses and identifies his mother—the poor Portuguese woman—with the bourgeois woman whose house she works in. I believe that, even if her baby tends to mix them up, that gets straightened out soon enough. And conversely, whether the child, small as they are, confuse the poor Portuguese woman washing the floor with their mother making love to their father.</p><p>I wonder if, from childhood, there aren’t properly unconscious and libidinal investments that aren’t at all directed at the family or family determinations, that only target the family coincidently, or where the parents are understood in relation to other social agents and aren’t confused with them, such that the libido, from early childhood, invests determinations from their social-historical field, and invests them—not as a Marxist thinker would, obviously, that only comes later, and at the level of the preconscious investments of interests—but invests them in the directly empirical form of: rich – poor. In other words, the rich and poor play, as Lacan might put it—though perhaps in a non-Lacanian way—they play the role of the other, the big Other, which is non-familial, which comes through in the structure of the family; they are extra-familial divisions in the social sphere; and that’s what the libido invests.</p><p>Third, in his writing, there’s this whole Freudian business with family romance.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-03-11/#_edn5 rel=noopener>5</a> It’s always about maids, and with bourgeois families, it has to get framed that way. With the family romance, we again see Freud’s oscillation and the choice he makes. He only hesitates inasmuch as he’s already decided between his two options, has already opted for the puerile, familial understanding. Freud discovers the family romance in the context of neurosis, and the neurotic’s family romance is presented as a fiction whereby the neurotic fantasizes their origins in one way or another. Again, we find the libidinal theme of wealth and poverty—sometimes the subject’s fantasy about their origins takes the form, “I’m from a lesser background, I am not my mom’s son, I’m the maid’s son”; sometimes it takes the form, “I’m of superior descent, I am the son of a prince, Mom had me with a prince.”</p><p>A famous example of the first sort of fantasy, the turn toward lower origins, is what we find in Sophocles’ famous <em>Oedipus Rex</em>: recall the famous exchange between Oedipus and Jocasta where Oedipus says, “I absolutely have to know where I come from,” and Jocasta—who understands the Oedipus complex well enough to know it isn’t a problem—responds, “Don’t worry about it, why does it matter?” And he is already so oedipalized that he says, “You don’t care about your origins because you’re from a rich, lustrous family, while, as the son of a poor shepherd, from a poor family, I’ve had to make my own success.” It really makes for a family romance, and he turns on Jocasta, saying, “Well, if you don’t want to talk about where I really come from, it’s because you’re ashamed of it.” So, he fantasizes his origin: I’m the son of a poor family, I’m the servant’s son.</p><p>What happens in Freud’s case? At first, when he discovers the family romance, it isn’t linked to neurosis is general; it was more precisely related to paranoia, and he had to some extent grasped the fullness of a sexual investment of the social field <em>qua</em> sexual investment. But that’s not what he wants; he’ll continue to stifle the possibility of that line of thinking, to the point that, when Reich brings it back up in a distorted form, he takes it badly, maintaining that the family romance is solely a defense against oedipal incest. That is, if the neurotic reconfigures their origins, it’s to escape the pressure of incestuous desire, so that again, when he’s on the verge of understanding the properly libidinal and sexual investments of the social field, he recants and falls back to the oedipal triangle, turning any social investments into merely preconscious derivatives of the only really libidinal investments, solely reserved for the incestuous oedipal familial arrangement.</p><p>This other theme, which Freud constantly muffles out, is always there, subsisting as a haunting reminder. What about the maid ultimately disturbed little Freud so much? I argue that if there’s a sexual investment of the social field, it happens at the level of childhood. It’s so important to Freud that it forms as an adult—ah, yes, any investment of the social field comes later—it’s because he wants for investments of the social field to not be libidinal, strictly speaking, but for them to presuppose a desexualization of the libido in order to maintain the libido’s narrow familial scope. But our whole hypothesis is that rich-and-poor, on the contrary, is really the sort of empirical apprehension of a class struggle as it’s invested, not by preconscious interests, but by unconscious desire: the child’s libidinal investment, insofar as it directly bears upon the social field, follows suit. Rich-and-poor is the Other in the sense of the nonfamilial, and there is, directly and immediately through the family—I believe children don’t have any familial investments, it’s laughable—on the contrary, through family determinations, family determinations playing an inciting rather than an organizing role, we find a different, non-familial, investment, along the lines of rich and poor; it’s in this sense that class struggle involves more than simply preconscious investments (although it plays a rather decisive role in preconscious investments); it goes through the ordeal of desire, and does so from childhood. It’s easy to see how what plays out next is the kind of fanatic oedipalization carried out by psychoanalysis. Everything proceeds as though even child sexuality opened onto a social historical field, investing it in its childish or unconscious way. What it invests in such a field based on major rich/poor divides that thereby determine an exteriority regarding the family. The family is divided and split by these cuts; it’s not that such cuts are determined by the family. What these divisions are, are veritable schizzes.</p><p>From the start, what’s invested is a transfinite set, the transfinite set of the social field—it isn’t a closed set by any stretch; it’s a transfinite set with divisions, and divisions of divisions. You cannot close it; it’s a kind of open set. This transfinite set of the social field includes machines, agents of production, agents of anti-production, and all that gets invested by the sexual libido. And what we look for in the succession of our later lovers—assuming we’re looking for something from our childhood—is certainly not some family nonsense but something more profound, namely familial investments of the non-familial from our childhood.</p><p>When psychoanalysts are shameful enough to claim that the worries of a child or woman going in for analysis—Why do they go in for psychoanalysis? The typical response is that it has something to do with the phallus. In Freudian terms, famously, a woman’s basic motivation for seeking analysis is her penis envy, and the same goes for children because, being the phallus without having one, they’re in a conflicting situation. It’s an oedipal reinterpretation. But it’s more than obvious that—to put it moralistically—taking up the position of being a woman or the position of being a child in our capitalist society is really impossible; and if it’s impossible, then, it takes unusual means to get out of it. Why? It’s certainly not “phallus or no phallus,” we’re missing something, namely that what makes it impossible for a child to assume their situation as a child is their economic dependence, both politically and libidinally. For a woman, it’s her economic dependence, which prevents or compromises investments of the social field. Yet it’s necessary, when socio-libidinal investments are blocked off by veritable impasses set up by said social field, it’s necessary that things come back to the familial field where the child or woman finds themselves totally imprisoned, tied down, and as a result, they may very well be sympathetic to the idea that <em>there</em> [in the family] lies the root of your troubles—and that isn’t the source of their worries at all; on the contrary, it’s a symptom and way of sidestepping the issue. That’s still the best way of repressing things.</p><p>The best means of repression: if you want to stifle social investments at the level of the unconscious and the libido, because that is something, there’s already the investment of the social field by preconscious interests; there’s already a whole system of repression at work when it comes to revolutionary or class interests, but with the unconscious libidinal investments of the same social field, taking place in a whole other mode, they don’t just need to be repressed; they need to be driven back. They’re just as shaped by society and by social determinations; they create real impasses in the social field that take desire back to the familial domain… You can see how it works: starting with a transfinite set invested by the libido, the social field is sexually invested by the libido. It’s not a coincidence that the characters in the family romance are always presented as connected to, or as having been derived from historical characters. It’s like the family romance says: yes, Genghis Khan is my real father, Catherine de Medici is my real mother, or the maid is the proletarian. That’s exactly the way in which, by way of some stimulus or other from the family, child sexuality starts to search for suitable divides in the social field and what it might invest therein.</p><p>It’s a transfinite set. Regardless how we describe what Oedipus does, whether we call it symbolic, imaginary, etc.—it’s always an act of reflection [<em>rabattement</em>], in a mathematician’s sense of the term. Which is when you project or rotate [<em>rabattre</em>] a starting set onto a target set, only the starting set is the social field invested by the libido, a transfinite set, [and] the target set is a finite set, the familial set. You go through this reflection or projection [<em>rabattement</em>], unseen and unknown, desire is trapped, sort of like, “Hey, this is what you wanted, buddy.” The part psychoanalysis plays is encouraging or, through its own means, carrying out this reflection—which it certainly didn’t invent, but for which it has found new methods.</p><p>This reflection is basically a race towards death. The familial target set everything gets projected onto is finite. 4, 3, 2, 1 0—the more it narrows in, the better, until desire is completely choked off and the only desire left is what gets psychoanalyzed. Tragic. 4, 3, 2, 1… <em>Four</em>—indeed, we’re told that in order for there to be an Oedipus, there must be a fourth term, as a prerequisite for its triangulation: this fourth term is famously missing: the phallus, missing in place, etc. The prerequisite for Oedipus is that its fourth term is always missing in place. Traditionally, there are three terms in the oedipal arrangement—they say there’s father, mother, and me. I’ll let you in on a secret. Narcissus, narcissism, comes <em>after</em> Oedipus, not before. The oedipal machine is an oedipal-narcissist machine; they were wrong to place Oedipus before—a fatal error. It’s a set-up of three, and then the entire social domain, with all its investments, is reflected onto it. That’s what desire gets reduced down to while it was beginning to conduct a fantastic experiment, a machinic experiment—humanity’s greatest activity: machining things. <em>Three</em>, Oedipus enters the scene; the fourth term was necessary for setting things up, then it wanders around the other three, it won’t stand on its own—the notorious phallus in relation to which all three positions get defined.</p><p>The motivation (save for those who have already gone through their first analysis) is always economic, i.e., a subject’s dependence, and not their dependence on daddy and mommy. That money matters are so embedded in psychoanalysis; it isn’t the first time that monetarization is hidden behind means of payment. If, for psychoanalysis, monetary relationships are so embedded in the patient/doctor relationship, and if gets justified under the silliest, most laughable pretexts, it’s because such internalization has the advantage of hiding something, namely the basic economic dependence defining [the patient’s] motivation to get analyzed. None of us see how, as such, women and children—I can’t see how a woman, <em>as</em> woman, could possibly assume her role as a woman in such a society. Even less so for children. From the perspective of desire, it’s impossible, and again, it’s not because of any penis-envy. As soon as the oedipal machine starts to function, it gets reduced again; it’s down to only two.</p><p>There are actually several possible outcomes; the oedipal machine can work in three different ways, depending on which of the three terms is excluded. First, father and mother join forces to dump the child. The first function of the oedipal machine, the giant grinder, is something we find all over part of Oedipus: the primitive scene, parental coitus, the child’s castration—father and mother join forces to maintain order, a secret order.</p><p>The second outcome is when it’s the child who gets rid of the father in order to join up with the mother. The incestuous side of things, the other aspect of Oedipus. Third: the mother joins forces with one or the other to suppress the third—the terrible mother, the so-called pre-oedipal mother, who is absolutely integral to Oedipus. Now, with only two terms left, another effort to get to its sought-after result, the death of desire. Already, when desire learns that what it desires above all is really to kill one’s father, to love one’s mother, it finds itself in a small territoriality, its private life, its tiny little secret—only two terms is still too many, which leads to the oedipal machine’s third phase. Here there’s only one term left, and it’s narcissism. It’s pretty obvious that narcissism is the result of the oedipal machine and not the other way around. And big Narcissus is still too much; the outcome of this race toward death is zero, and zero is what Freud, out of psychoanalysis, labels as “the death drive.” Desire can no longer be anything other than a desire for abolition—sadness.</p><p>Here’s where I claim schizo-analysis is the opposite; where do we find this kind of infinite reduction? It’s what I find so striking in recent books written by certain analysts, who go so far as to say, ([Serge] Leclaire) there’s a sort of radical decentering of analysis today, i.e., where you don’t even need to refer to the familial scene anymore, the psychoanalytic scene stands on its own; it’s never been better said: psychoanalysis has become axiomatic, <em>verum index sui</em>, i.e., the psychoanalytic scene no longer needs external references, even the family is too extrinsic; it draws on its own internal references, it props itself up—the real proving ground is now the couch. The zero term approaches; after leaving the couch, there’s abolition.</p><p>Let’s picture a schizo-analytic process. It should absolutely regroup this field, i.e., in practice, in terms of individual analyses, [it should] denounce the death drive, i.e., its practice should combat the extreme lengths the oedipal machine takes to bring us to zero, and then shatter its familial prison at the level of investments and recover its opening—and this is what makes it schizo-analysis—bringing the subject to delusions about their social historical field instead of bringing them to neurosis about daddy-mommy. Whereby it ought to be thought of as a militant analysis since, again, class struggle doesn’t simply take place at the level of preconscious interests; it moves to the level of the libidinal investments of the unconscious. To use a proposition as classical as Freud’s, the libido invests the social field only inasmuch as it is desexualized (see the ego and the id and the Schreber case). I see that as just a way of telling us: desire has nothing to do with the social field; the domain of desire <em>qua</em> unconscious desire is Oedipus. Which is why schizo-analysis’s basic proposition is, on the contrary, that libidinal investment as such concerns the social field and, as such, doesn’t entail any desexualization. And an individual’s sexual relations or a group’s sexual relations are only exponents of such investments by unconscious desire of the social historical field.</p><p>We should revisit what Freud says about maids. Last year, I said: acknowledged or not, explicit or latent, all this familialism driving psychoanalysis is rather serious because, once desire has been oedipalized, the only freedom desire enjoys takes the form of a death drive. What I mean is that once we’ve oedipalized life—as Nietzsche might put it—one can only find the essence of life in the guise of life turned against itself, as death. And again, it’s not that any desire from one’s social field only appears in adulthood—that wouldn’t make sense because it would be like saying, okay, child sexuality has to be desexualized in order to invest the social field; it’s that way even in childhood. Before, the patient wasn’t anchored in the family; that was a 19th century development in psychiatry, a bourgeois idea, as Foucault demonstrated. And he’s absolutely correct in saying that psychoanalysis—through completely new means—isn’t opposed to 19th century psychiatry; it pulls off what 19th century psychiatry had started and failed to achieve, since the latter didn’t have the powerful family tool, the couch. It had the asylum. Freud finished what Pinel started. You have to see where the cuts are made.</p><p>What I can’t help but notice is how even the most leftist takes—no matter how daring, even the folks who are anti-psychiatry—come up short because they don’t get past this damned familialism. [R.D.] Laing sees the danger; his account of schizophrenogenic families is a lot of fun.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-03-11/#_edn6 rel=noopener>6</a> See Laing and [Aaron] Esterson’s <em>Sanity, Madness, and the Family
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-03-11/#_edn7 rel=noopener>**[7]**</a></em> — they analyze families and attempt to show what makes a family schizophrenogenic. They first begin with a schizo and work up to the family. They set the scene for us and then, when we look at what they describe as a schizophrenogenic family, the big twist is that it’s actually a typical oedipal family. What they call a schizophrenogenic factor is an organizing determination of the family: the famous double bind, i.e., sending contradictory signals where the subject supposedly goes crazy, caught in a double impasse. For a characteristic example, see the book written by one of Laing’s patients, who was miraculously cured
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-03-11/#_edn8 rel=noopener>8</a>—she was painting with her excrement. In group discussions, some patients argued to let her do it, others didn’t because it wasn’t clean. One day Laing, looking at one of her scatological paintings, said, “Not bad, but it needs color.” The woman starts to add color and then becomes a painter—she offers an account of her life, a description of her family.</p><p>But what family doesn’t constantly put out double binds? What father doesn’t take his kid with one hand and say, “I’m your best friend,” and at the same time, with the other hand, “You’ll get a smack if you act up.” That’s exactly what the double bind is, and the joke’s on all of us if that’s what we’re calling schizophrenogenic. [Gregory] Bateson’s whole deal is how the neurotic is determined by the oedipal family. In <em>The Self and Others,</em> Laing says at the end that the schizo is someone who has fundamentally—he proposes the two concepts of infirmation and confirmation—who has been infirmed, or who has only gotten a false confirmation à la the double bind. This etiology of schizophrenia is still familialist and ultimately brings things back to a neurotic framework: the so-called schizophrenogenic factor is a factor normally attributed to Oedipus, and it’s back to business as usual, still oedipalizing things. But when we’re dealing with a schizo, we’re sure they have family problems, but it’s somewhere else, they’re from another world, so much so that they’ll agree, “Sure, fine, my father, my mother…” [because] they’re fed up, they’re tired. They hear voices, and these voices aren’t daddy-and-mommy; it’s their social-historical field.</p><p>It seems to me that neither anti-psychiatry nor institutional psychiatry get out of this familialism, but I argue that the study of schizophrenia can only begin to understand its object if we sever this pseudo-relationship between desire and family.</p><p>I’m told that I’m being totally unfair to Leclaire; I claim that isn’t my intent whatsoever. What stands out to me in S[erge] Leclaire’s work is how there are two poles: one pole is completely oriented toward overcoming Oedipus and the other leans toward making psychoanalysis into a sort of internal axiomatics, and I don’t know how he’s able to reconcile these two directions.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-03-11/#_edn9 rel=noopener>9</a></p><p>Moving over to the economic side of things, my whole basic assumption is that there’s a major affinity between the capitalist machine and schizophrenia. In other words, the functioning of capitalism is sort of a schizo way of functioning. But, but, but the hypothesis I’d like to work toward is that they are, at the same time, perfectly similar—the processes of capitalism and schizophrenia ought to be evaluated economically and not at all ideologically; the affinity between the capitalist machine and the schizophrenic machine breaks out at the level of economic activity—and at the same time, they are completely different, because… the affinity between the capitalist and schizophrenic processes is due to the identity in their nature, but their difference is owing to the fact that there’s an essential difference in their regimes. Identity of nature, difference of regime—that’s where we’re aiming. Last time, we started with the idea that the identity in their nature is as follows: if the schizo is someone who emits and channels decoded flows, who decodes every flow—which is why he doesn’t get caught up in Oedipus, because Oedipus is a recoding [<em>recodage</em>]—the neurotic is someone who avoids schizophrenia thanks to a recoding, only this recoding can’t be an ordinary (social) recording; it’s an Oedipal recoding.</p><p>Capitalism, historically, has been constituted on the basis of decoded flows, and it’s the decoding of flows which has made capitalism possible as such. Its existence doesn’t come down to decoding flows, because flows can be decoded without making and forming a capitalist machine, as is clear with Ancient Rome, with feudalism—capitalism comes to be when a conjugation of decoded flows is established, when decoded flows as such enter a determinable relationship.</p><p>In the pre-capitalist social field, it’s decoded all over, literally, it escapes as a series of independent leaks [<em>fuites</em>], and we’ve seen how capitalism emerges when two decoded flows form a conjugation, namely, the decoded flow of money and the deterritorialized flow of labor. And when the money-owner—money which will turn into capital via this conjugation, this encounter—and the deterritorialized, possessing only the force of their labor, come face to face in the market. And we can only make sense of this development if we recognize how this double decoding entails two completely independent series—which is why their encounter might not have happened, why we find decoding at a certain point in Roman history without their conjugation taking place—it’s radically contingent.</p><p>But what form does this encounter take? The money-owner—with all the historical circumstances we’ve seen—once it was in their interest to sell their land and once it was in their interest to invest their money in industry, well, private owners of decoded money will purchase the labor of deterritorialized workers. And in the process, it appears that capital truly becomes—insofar as capital buys labor—industrial capital. There was capital before, but not in a capitalist sense; there was merchant’s (commercial) capital and bank capital, but—to borrow Marx’s wonderful turn of phrase—it only functioned in the pores of the old formation. What does that mean? Literally, that means it functioned as alliance capital, allied with prior pre-capitalist societies, be they feudal or despotic.</p><p>The Chinese empire, for example: there is fully merchant capital, fully bank capital, which works in alliance, with everything that entails such as surveillance, with everything that entails such as state power, the great despot—it functions as capital in alliance with previous pre-capitalist society. After the encounter between both series of decoded flows, which will be constitutive of industrial capital, the capital which will become industrial capital undergoes a sort of mutation, a mutation whereby alliance capital is transformed into what we might call filiation capital. This transformation is well-described in a great passage from <em>Capital</em>, the section of <em>Book I</em> titled, “The General Formula for Capital,” where Marx writes, “[value] suddenly presents itself as an independent substance, endowed with a motion of its own […] in which money and commodities are mere forms which it assumes and casts off”—that is, as merchant capital and bank capital, commodities and money now fall under this new form. “Nay, more: instead of simply representing the relations of commodities, it enters now, so to say, into private relations with itself. It differentiates itself as original value from itself as surplus-value,” in the same way that, in his person, God differentiates himself from himself as Father and Son. There’s no better way of describing how capital becomes filial capital. Thus, it’s the work of surplus value, which itself depends on the conjunction of both decoded flows, the flow of money and the flow of labor, which turns capital into industrial filial capital. But what is the formula for this filial capital? If you like, we might represent it as <em>x + ax</em>. It’s the form whereby money becomes capital, and money becomes capital to the extent that money engages in what Marx calls expansion [<em>bourgeonnement</em>] that is, to the extent that money produces money. An ineffable mystery: how money can produce money. <em>X + ax</em>, “<em>ax</em>” here referring to surplus value, i.e., the form whereby money makes money—that’s the “<em>+ ax</em>.” Where does this surplus value come from? We know that, according to Marx, it comes precisely from this encounter, this conjugation between whoever owns the flow of money and whoever owns the flow of labor, because the latter sells their labor.</p><p>From there, there are basically two patterns: an arithmetical pattern that might be expressed as <em>A’ – A = surplus value</em>, where surplus value is understood as an arithmetical difference. That’s the tendency in all of Marx’s writing; he says the one buying labor does so in the form of paying wages. These wages correspond to what it takes to maintain and renew the worker’s labor force. Let’s say it’s 6 hours—so, 6 hours = what’s needed for the maintenance and reproduction of the labor force. But when he buys the labor, he hasn’t bought 6 hours, even if he pays by the hour; he’s bought a day’s worth of labor, let’s say 12 hours. Therefore, there’s a difference between what the buyer gets from labor (by making them work for 12 hours) and what he pays for it, which is for 6 hours—hence the formula for surplus value is <em>A’ – A,</em> an arithmetical difference. Obviously anti-Marxist economists are working on a similar basis, which isn’t a Marxist idea. Yet, in the same passages, he says something quite different. He tells us that there’s a difference between labor power with respect to its exchange value and labor power with respect to its use value.</p><p>At these points of the text, the difference is no longer arithmetical because the difference between considering something in terms of its exchange value and considering the same thing in terms of its use value comes down to a quantitative [<em>sic</em>] difference. Indeed, he says, wages paid by the owner of money-capital represent the exchange value of labor power, while the labor supplied by the owner of labor power itself has to do with use value. As a result, it’s no longer an arithmetical difference, but a qualitative one. At which point, the formula for surplus value is no longer <em>A’ – A,</em> i.e., 12 – 6 = 6 surplus value, but is <em>Æy / Æx</em>, where <em>Æy</em> is the fluctuation at a given moment in the flow of capital possessed by the money-capital owner, and <em>Æx</em> the fluctuation in the flow of labor possessed by the owner of labor power. In other words, it’s no longer an arithmetical difference; it conforms to the difference in nature between the two flows. It’s a differential relationship. This second formula, <em>Æy</em> / <em>Æx,</em> has the upper hand, and we’ll see right away where this <em>Æx</em> just now comes from: it’s precisely because <em>Æx</em> and <em>Æy</em> are the elements of a differential relationship that <em>Æx</em> is produced by adding it to <em>x</em>. There, the variation whereby the filiative form of capital produces <em>Æx</em> provides the nature of the differential relationship <em>Æy</em> / <em>Æx</em>. We have to try to understand what this differential relationship is, and perhaps the entire capitalist economy hinges on such a relationship, and it does, but that remains to be verified.</p><p>And here my hypothesis bears out, namely, my assumption that capitalism either never runs on codes, or else, any codes are there for fun. It’s the first social regime that doesn’t use codes, and in that sense it’s very close to schizophrenia. But in another way, they aren’t close, because [capitalism] has come upon a wonderful trick: in place of failing and absent codes, it’s swapped in an axiomatic, an axiomatic machine a thousand times crueler, more cynical, more terrifying than the code of the great despot. More than anything, an axiomatic implies that—perhaps for the first time—capitalism presents itself as a society determining a field of immanence, and it forms the conjugation of decoded flows therein. The axiomatics of flows forms a field of immanence which capitalism will fill in with its own content, whereas before, there was always a relationship between the social field and codes invoking ideologically transcendent determinations.</p><p>What do we make of this qualitative difference? We can no longer get away with calling them two heterogeneous flows, especially since we no longer have codes qualifying these flows; we’ve gone beyond such a simple perspective now that we’ve seen how these two qualitatively distinct flows are caught up in a very particular sort of relationship, a differential relationship, just like how in differential calculus you have the relationship of the differential of the abscissa and the differential of the ordinate. If it’s true that both flows concerned are the flow of money capital convertible into means of production, of which part, if you like, is convertible into constant capital, and the other part into the purchase of labor power, i.e., into variable capital. [If that’s true,] the two flows are heterogeneous, but they’re like two parts of capital: constant capital, variable capital. From there, there’s no doubt that the qualitative duality of these flows must show up again in money, and that moreover, the mechanism of money brings us to the type of relationship that exists between the two.</p><p>The nature of their differential relationship is such that the two quantities [<em>grandeurs</em>], understood as heterogeneous, qualitatively distinct, are not of the same power [<em>puissance</em>]. One of the two must be a power, with the other a mere quantity. We should get a handle on the nature of both flows and how they’re related to money. I’d like to propose the following principle: in essence, money sort of plays out on two tables, and the coexistence of these two tables will form the most general basis for the mechanisms of capitalism. I’m relying on two current economists: Suzanne de Brunhoff
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-03-11/#_edn10 rel=noopener>10</a> and then a neo-capitalist economist whose theory is unwittingly completely schizophrenic, so much so that we might ask what difference there is between a text of scientific ambition in economics and a schizophrenic text when it comes to the mechanisms of capitalism. This economist, who is so spirited, so talented, is Bernard Schmitt, and I’ll refer to his book, <em>Money, Wages, and Profit</em> [<em>Paris: PUF, 1966</em>].
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-03-11/#_edn11 rel=noopener>11</a></p><p>Now, phenomenologically speaking—which is the only thing I’m concerned with, at the moment—Suzanne de Brunhoff, a Marxist, and the other one, who certainly isn’t Marxist, both say exactly the same thing. Basically: there are two forms of money, which lead to two different consequences. The Marxist’s takeaway is that the mechanisms of capitalism can only function by establishing a fictitious convertibility, more specifically, between both kinds of money. This convertibility is completely fictitious—it depends on the gold standard, it depends on the unity of markets, it depends on interest rates. In fact, it isn’t meant to function; according to Suzanne de Brunhoff, it’s meant to conceal the working of capitalism. This fictitious, hypothetical, constant convertibility from one form of money to the other ensures that how it works remains hidden. What I find interesting about this concept of concealment is that, where Brunhoff’s analysis is concerned, it’s no longer an ideological concept but an operational, organizational concept. That is, the capitalist monetary circuit can only function on the basis of an objective concealment, which comes down to the convertibility of one form of money to another.</p><p>What Schmitt has to say comes down to the same thing: he fully acknowledges both forms of money and attempts to define them. One, he says, is a pure creative flow—you can already sense how the basic phenomenon in capitalism is what every banker recognizes as the creation of money, a creative flow in the form of the creation of money. The other, completely different form is revenue-money, i.e., money defined as purchasing power. What’s so devious about Schmitt’s argument is how he says, look, what creates purchasing power is the transformation of the first form of money, the flow creating money, into the second form, revenue-money; purchasing power does not predate the form of revenue-money. That could be—why not? In fact, there is a form of money, creation of money, mutant power—monetarization famously transforming an economy by creating money. Central banks play a determining role here, creating money. There’s another form, revenue-money, purchasing power. What creates purchasing power is revenue-money and mutations in the flow of creating revenue-money; purchasing power doesn’t exist beforehand. One immediate consequence: the worker hasn’t been bought; there can’t be theft, there is no surplus value. Schmitt says that Marx was wrong, that, for there to be surplus value, it’s necessary that the worker’s labor power be bought, but it can’t be through wage-income because purchasing power is created by income; income cannot presuppose it. Therefore, he says, wages are not a form of purchase; it’s a form of mutating one money into another.</p><p>At this level, Brunhoff and Schmitt say more or less the same thing: in both cases, there are two irreducible forms of money, there’s a passage or mutation from one form to the other, and that’s the only way a capitalist system can function. On a purely descriptive level, it’s all too obvious that the money flowing through a firm or from a bank are signs of capital’s power, or if you like, it’s a force prospective in nature, which, strictly speaking—save for when the firm declares bankruptcy—at that point passes from one form of money to the other, signs of economic power which cannot be actualized here and now since, in effect, they imply an entire system of relationships between differential coefficients, involving other firms, finance banks, etc.</p><p>So, on the one hand, you have a system of signs of economic power, of unrealizable prospective forces, a detachment-cut in a system of capitalism’s monetary signs, and broadly speaking, we’ll file these signs of economic power away under the general heading of the structure of finance. It’s the whole structure of finance that goes through a company, connecting it to banks, going to other companies, connected to other banks.</p><p>As for employees, what they receive, the money they’re working with doesn’t have to do with signs of economic power that can’t be realized here and now, with a prospective value, but with signs of exchange value that don’t represent a financial structure but a means of payment, i.e., payment for their labor, payment they’ll actualize by buying goods. This system of means of payment and exchange values is convertible into goods and into use-values, and it [<em>missing,</em> enters] into a sort of one-to-one relationship with an imposed range of products, suggested by the market. They have their means of payment; they acquire certain types of suggested goods. This time it’s not as a detachment-cut [<em>coupure-détachement</em>] into a set of signs of economic power; they’re withdrawal-cuts [<em>coupures-prélévements</em>] on a series of products, the appropriation of which depends on my possessing a number of means of payment.</p><p>I’m just trying to mark out concrete domains. Money has two distinct, fundamental aspects that confirm our initial assumption: <em>Æy</em> and <em>Æx</em> refer to quantities which evidently don’t have the same power [<em>puissance</em>], i.e., the money that goes in and out of a company is not at all the same as the money going in and out of the employee’s pocket. And again, once we pretend that the two are interchangeable, they <em>are</em>, effectively—and that’s what’s funny about it, because it doesn’t matter, since that doesn’t change anything about their difference in nature. By no means do they have the same capacity [<em>puissances</em>]. One is really a sign of economic power, while the other is nothing of the sort—strictly speaking, it’s the sign of the employee’s powerlessness. One defines a financial structure; the other defines a series of payment methods—but that isn’t the same thing at all, and that at least confirms our initial assumption, namely, that it was necessary for at least one of the two quantities [<em>grandeurs</em>] to be an incommensurable power unrelated to the other, the other being quantity [<em>grandeur</em>] pure and simple. As a result, when we try to use one to measure the other, it’s like trying to use centimeters to measure astronomical distances. It’s an aspect of money that functions in a completely different way.</p><p>There are two things I’d add. This same duality, if we try to define it in more precise terms, the first idea that comes to mind is that means of payment are more or less what we call the money of exchange, and the other, the making of money, would refer to so-called credit money.</p><p>But it turns out that won’t do, and we can take this relationship even deeper: we actually find these two forms within credit money. How so? The distinction made between bank credit and commercial credit—commercial credit refers to phenomena of circulation, so-called simple circulation. For example: bills of exchange with a fixed maturity are credit money acting as payment money. The nature of bank credit is completely different; it implies a particular sort of circulation which is completely unrelated to the circulation of commodities. It implies a special circuit, the circulation of drafts, throughout which credit gains and loses its exchange value.</p><p>Thus, it’s not just in the overall dualism between exchange-money/credit-money—more specifically, we find it there in credit money as such, in the dualism between commercial credit and bank credit: the dualism between payment and financing. In the end, the two flows we started with, the flow of money-capital and the flow of labor, have been transformed by the differential relationship between two very different flows of money: the flow of money as financial structure and the flow of money as means of payment. Which puts us in a position to amend something I said earlier, which turns out to be false, that we only get capitalism as such with industrial capitalism. Yes and no. I mean, it’s true that capitalism as such can only emerge in the form of commercial or banking capital—which always colludes with, or would have always colluded with, other forms of society—were it not for industrial capital, but we ought to add that, sure, capitalism is fundamentally industrial, but it functions solely as commercial and banking capital, which has its sights set on industrial production. And there, then, such commercial and banking capital is no longer allied with pre-capitalist society. It finds its true ally, its alliance with industrial capital itself, an alliance which entails all sorts of violence, all the pressure and power that banking capital exerts over the very organization of production.</p><p>A student: [<em>A</em> <em>question regarding economics</em>]</p><p>Deleuze: I have a concern (<em>souci</em>). I’ve given two approximations of the regions where this form of money appears: one is the distinction between money in a bank-business circuit and the other form of money as means of payment, i.e., what goes in and out of an employee’s pocket. The second was the distinction between two domains of credit money: commercial credit and bank credit. It would be interesting to add other domains where this distinction is borne out; we’d have to demonstrate how the bank has power over both forms of money, i.e., how it issues payments and how it works out finance structures, and how that corresponds to banking activities that are theoretically convertible but which are, in reality, distinct.</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p><a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-03-11/#_ednref1 rel=noopener>1</a> “Invest” and “investment” for forms of <em>investir,</em> following Hurley, Seem, and Lane’s translation.

He also discusses how desiring machines invest the social field in two ways: either by subordinating themselves to molar aggregates and repressive apparatuses (paranoia), or by escaping along lines of flight and deterritorialization (schizophrenia).</li><li><strong>The tasks of schizo-analysis</strong>: Deleuze outlines the three main tasks of schizo-analysis, which are: 1) to destroy the pseudo-formations of the unconscious, such as Oedipus, dreams, and fantasies; 2) to reach the desiring machines of the unconscious, which are molecular formations that function and produce; 3) to uncover the nature of the social investments of the unconscious, which are either paranoid or schizophrenic.</li></ul><blockquote><p>Where things get tricky—I suppose—in schizo-analysis, is finding someone’s desiring machines. What’s the deal with your things, what are your machines? Then, if the person doesn’t answer in terms of machines, or if we can’t manage to find their machinic elements… obviously, that raises the question: what is our criterion? What allows us to say, ah, <em>there</em>, we’ve pinned down someone’s desiring machines? I think there are very solid criteria, and they specifically come down to this: desiring machines are molecular formations, never molar aggregates.</p></blockquote><p><em>This extremely fragmentary session consists mainly of two responses by Deleuze to student questions and also of Deleuze’s reiteration of the three tasks of schizo-analysis. The first question concerns the axes of code and axiomatics proposed by Deleuze, then desire’s investment of the social field, and also the investment of the social field by desiring machines. While the first positive task of schizo-analysis is to reach the lines of flight of the unconscious, he recognizes that all investments are necessarily molar or social. Hence the second task, discovering how social investments function at the level of the unconscious, and he notes that this usually requires recognizing how desiring machines are repressed by molar apparatuses of the State or the family. Another question concerns the Schreber case, whether the social investment takes several generations for the paranoiacs to be established. Deleuze points to several approaches (anti-psychiatry; Lacan) toward this aspect, and he considers such chicken-or-egg questions difficult but necessary, yet provided one avoids the indefinite familial reduction. Deleuze manages to express a certain hope that rather than ultimately reterritorializing on artificial land, the movement of deterritorialization might create a new earth. The session ends with Deleuze disagreeing with a student’s Lacanian emphasis who insists that the generational question is relevant, to be pursued the following week.</em></p><p>Richard Pinhas: One thing I’d like to bring up—not that I’m necessarily arguing against it—earlier you outlined the two main axes for our investigation, the first being “code and axiomatics” and the second being the way in which desire invests the social field, the question being how it does so. I’m curious why you didn’t take that line of inquiry further and ask <em>why</em>. What I’m getting at is something along the lines of what happens in fascism—to take a random example—there’s a relationship which shows us why the desire/social field relationship is sort of transformed; it’s the fact that the object [of desire] completely disappears. [Its] link has been severed, wrecked. This is illustrated rather well in certain surrealist films from 1940-40 [<em>sic</em>], where we see money depreciating, inflation, for example. And there’s an element that sort of makes the object of desire completely disappear; some essential aspect gives rise to, lends itself to fascism as we know it. I suppose that after a given period of transformation, we more or less find the same process—different, but similar.</p><p>Gilles Deleuze: You began with the necessity of asking “why.” I understand everything you said afterwards, but I don’t quite understand why this question is necessary, and how it fits in with the rest of what you said. I think there’s no need to ask “why” because this whole system of machines is due to functionalism. If you ask “why,” you’re back to working with categories of signifiers; it’s a risky question. I believe there’s a domain—the domain of machines we call machines of desire, or desiring machines—where what we get is functionalism, that is, our only question is “How does it work?”—“How” and not “Why.” And this is why certain ethnologists are still in touch with how desire manifests in the social field—when they ask themselves, “What exactly is the purpose of psychoanalysis? Does it really serve our purposes as ethnologists?” And they say yes and no, because for us, as ethnologists, at the end of the day what we’re interested in has nothing to do with what something means—however one poses that question—it’s actually: “How does it work in the social field?”</p><p>Then it’s clear where the argument goes from there: never does the function or the use of something explain its production. For example, the way in which an organism functions could never explain that organism’s mode of production, or how an institution functions could never explain how the institution itself is formed. I think this anti-functionalist argument is spot-on, but in what context? [It’s spot-on] at the level of large aggregates, of molar aggregates.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-04-11/#_edn1 rel=noopener>1</a> There, indeed, how something is used always comes second to how something is formed. But if we’re trying to approach the unconscious in terms of machines, in terms of factories, in terms of units of production, in terms of desiring machines, I don’t think these are big machines; they are micro-machines. The machinic unconscious, the unconscious of desiring machines, is essentially a micro-unconscious, a micro-logical, micro-physical unconscious. Or, if you prefer, it’s a molecular unconscious.</p><p>Yet, in other words, at the level of molecular formations, as opposed to molar aggregates, strictly speaking, there is no possible difference between form and function. If I say how something works, there’s nothing else I can say. For schizo-analysis, the question isn’t at all — I recognize that the question “What does it mean” is rather complex because at a certain point, “What does it mean” might simply refer to a signified, or as they say, the whole question is knowing, when talking about the signifier, whether the question is still “What does it mean,” or whether it’s something else. Personally, I think it’s the same question. The question is still “What does it mean,” only crossed out, but it still falls under “What does it mean,” while desiring machines, strictly speaking, don’t <em>mean</em> anything—neither in terms of signifieds, nor in terms of signifiers — for schizo-analysis, the problem is: “What are your machines?” And that’s not easy to figure out.</p><p>A guy comes in; what are his desiring machines? It’s not enough to point out that he likes to drive, that he has a fridge—that’s all related to his desiring machines, but that’s not what his desiring machines are. On the other hand, neither are his desiring machines fantasies; they aren’t imaginary objects that function as doubles—it isn’t the dreamed car as the real car’s double… Desiring machines are molecular formations that exist objectively in larger technical machines and in larger social machines. That’s why, I think, we have to critique everything that’s dream, fantasy—the unconscious doesn’t dream, doesn’t fantasize, no more than the unconscious is a theatre. Dreams and fantasies are by-products of one’s reflection. They are territorialities of Oedipus; dreams are always oedipal. If analysts always stuck to dreams, they’d necessarily come back to Oedipus.</p><p>There’s a wonderful part of Bergson where he writes that it’s no surprise that matter and intelligence dovetail together, that matter and intelligence are tailormade for each other, since they both come from differenciating the same one movement, and well, it’s the same with Oedipus and dreams. It’s not surprising that all dreams are inherently Oedipal, because the same movement constitutes both dreams and Oedipus.</p><p>But that has nothing to do with desiring machines, so where things get tricky—I suppose—in schizo-analysis, is finding someone’s desiring machines. What’s the deal with your things, what are your machines? Then, if the person doesn’t answer in terms of machines, or if we can’t manage to find their machinic elements… obviously, that raises the question: what is our criterion? What allows us to say, ah, <em>there</em>, we’ve pinned down someone’s desiring machines? I think there are very solid criteria, and they specifically come down to this: desiring machines are molecular formations, never molar aggregates—but I get the feeling I’m not addressing your comment—all I’m saying is that, at the molecular level and only at the molecular level, functionalism reigns supreme, and that’s because function, production, form, are all one, strictly speaking. A desiring machine is defined only by how it functions, which is to say how it’s formed, which is to say how it’s produced. As it stands, I’d say that the question “why” never comes up.</p><p>Pinhas: I think maybe I didn’t word my question the right way. I wasn’t trying to question the fact that it works, or to reintroduce linguistic-psychoanalytic categories, etc. What I was trying to ask is, after the question of how, there are processes—I tried to offer an example of something I think fits the description: fascism—there’s why it works, in that sense, and then there’s why it works in another way, if you will. It works this way at one moment, and meanwhile, in another country, for example, it works another way. I think that, in that context, over and above the question how, we might afterwards ask the question why.</p><p>Deleuze: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. That’s a very particular “why,” then. It’s a “why” concerning the nature of the social field invested by desire and desiring machines. Where the social field’s characteristics come from, at such and such time, under such and such circumstances. Here, again, it’s pretty complicated. We’d need to maintain, like, two practical guidelines or principles, alongside there being desiring machines, which run along molecular lines, what I’d like to call lines of flight.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-04-11/#_edn2 rel=noopener>2</a> It’s not even enough to reach lines of resistance in the unconscious. The essential thing about the unconscious is that it escapes; it goes along lines of flight. Yet Oedipus, fantasies, dream, and what not—far from being real productions or formations of the unconscious—are all tourniquets, plugging up the unconscious’s lines of flight or escape. That’s why we have to blow all that up to reveal its lines of flight, which then lead us to a molecular unconscious of desiring machines. These are molecular formations, micro-formations, whereby it becomes a non-figurative, non-symbolic unconscious. It’s neither figurative nor symbolic—it’s what Lacan calls the Real, only not just a possible real, but a functional real.</p><p>Then, we have to simultaneously maintain, basically, two poles: one pole would be one like—it gets tricky; fortunately, at one level we’d distinguish two poles: the first being investments of molar aggregates, investments of the social field and everything that comes with that, including family investments, the family being one molar aggregate among others, a molar sub-aggregate**.**</p><p>And then, at the other end, there’d be molecular lines of flight, just as you might distinguish between macro-physics and micro-physics. Really, then, schizo-analysis would operate in terms of units of production of the micro-unconscious of small, molecular formations—that would have to be our first principle, but at the same time—so, again, we’d need to distinguish between investments of molar aggregates and investments of molecular formations, of desiring machines, on the other side of social and technical machines. Which is how we would define one of the main activities involved in the practice of schizo-analysis: nothing can get off the ground until we get to the desiring machines of someone’s unconscious, i.e., their molecular functioning formations. If we can’t reach them, we can’t do anything; we’re still dealing with big aggregates: Oedipus, the family, etc. As I see it, the signifier is a molar sign, fundamentally, a sign structuring big, molar aggregates, thus completely unrelated to desiring machines.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-04-11/#_edn3 rel=noopener>3</a></p><p>So, that would be the first task for schizo-analysis: reaching the lines of flight of the unconscious. Which means the unconscious doesn’t express itself, doesn’t attract; it escapes, and it causes its desiring machines to function based on its lines of flight. As Plato might put it, when it draws near its opposite, it either retreats or perishes
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-04-11/#_edn4 rel=noopener>4</a>—in the same way, the unconscious either perishes under Oedipus or escapes through its lines of flight.</p><p>But, from another perspective—one which doesn’t cancel out the first—we’d have to make what seems like the opposite point: that all investments, no matter what kind, are necessarily molar or social. Any investment is necessarily the investment of big aggregates; all investments are investments of big aggregates by molecular formations one can identify as desiring machines. No matter what, desiring machines—their parts and their cogs—invest big molar aggregates.</p><p>The second task of schizo-analysis would be to discover the nature of these social investments in a person, at the level of the unconscious. And I’m saying the two aren’t contradictory: in one, we say there are two positions: big aggregates defined by social and technical machines, and on the other side, molecular lines of flight and desiring machines. With the other, it’s that all investments are molar and social, just that social investments have two poles: a paranoid pole, which we could just as easily call fascist, reactionary investment, which consists in subordinating desiring machines to big, repressive apparatuses, to the big apparatuses of the state or of the family. The vulgarized psychoanalytical framework has to be flipped: paranoia is what comes first, what comes second is oedipal neurosis, and then third is Narcissus. The Oedipus complex is first of all a paranoid idea; it’s only secondarily a neurotic feeling, i.e., the neurotic is someone who’s been fooled, who’s been fooled by the paranoiac. It’s a father’s notion, and it’s not a father’s notion regarding his son—he doesn’t care about his son—the paranoiac is someone who starts hallucinating their social field by sadistically subordinating all their desiring machines to the repressive apparatuses of their social field.</p><p>At any rate, desiring machines are within real machines; they don’t resemble them, as in that absurd way of understanding dreams, and so on…it’s not about saying, ah, yes, uh, uh—it’s not about making psychoanalysis some kind of gizmo, uh, for market research, where we go, <em>hmm, what dream car lies behind the real car</em>? That’s not it. Desiring machines exist objectively. They exist in the cogs and parts of social machines and technical machines; they just can’t be extracted at the macroscopic level. That’s why it takes a microscopic analysis to draw out someone’s desiring machines. Someone who’s paranoid isn’t worried about their son. Schreber’s father is <em>the</em> paranoiac. You can see how his paranoia works, and in this regard, you can see the extent to which psychiatric understandings of paranoia are reactionary. If they didn’t link paranoia to family events, they’d be forced to acknowledge that paranoia, precisely because it has nothing to do with family relationships, is an inherently fascist, reactionary investment of one’s social field. The paranoid man’s delusions aren’t about his wife or about his son; his delusions are about race, education, culture. The schizophrenic too, but in a different way. At its root, the paranoiac’s delusion is “let’s create a pure race”: a sense that everything is in decline, that we’re no longer pure Aryans. Although he’s looking at his little kid, that’s only secondary. And there he applies—Oedipus is always an act of reduction [<em>rabattement</em>], application—he presents himself as the great pedagogue, the great restorer to the races. Schreber’s father started with a whole other dimension: the deviation of his social field. Our world’s been ruined; let’s recreate the pure race—and with what? With machines.</p><p>First, the paranoiac is delusional about the social field. I argue that paranoia ought to be defined in absolutely non-oedipal terms, as a particular way of investing the social field. A kind of investment of the social field, an investment that completely subordinates the system of desiring machines, or molecular formations, to greater molar aggregates. That in mind, in application to his family, as a privileged molar sub-aggregate, he applies his reform, his pure race, and produces an oedipalized little guy. Which is thus a product of earlier paranoid investment. It’s in this sense that the Oedipus complex is something experienced by the neurotic son inheriting his paranoid father’s big idea, but the latter’s idea isn’t oedipal; it consists in investing the entire social field.</p><p>The other idea is that everything is social investment, only it ranges between two poles: from paranoia, which broadly subordinates desiring machines to the apparatuses of large aggregates, to schizophrenia, schizophrenic escape, molecular lines of flight, desiring machines—it’s the same thing. And it’s no less deeply connected to the social field than paranoia’s sweeping integrations. It isn’t more delirious; it’s just a different sort of delirium. Because delirium has like two ends of the spectrum (constantly oscillating), and the schizophrenic side of delirium carries out the inverse sort of subordination, subordinating big molar aggregates to molecular formations. Which is why lines of flight don’t just consist in doing something; they also entail driving something away.</p><p>As a result, schizo-analysis basically has three tasks.</p><p>–  A destructive task: taking a big curette to the unconscious, i.e., has to blow up: Oedipus, dream, fantasy, myth, tragedy, no more theater—at the same time (not later on).</p><p>— Its first positive goal: reaching someone’s desiring machines. And you can never get at them directly; all we have are machinic indices, which might as well be practically hidden—that’s fine, that’s inevitable, there are only indices, not at all in the sense of “why” that I denounced earlier, but because they belong to a different regime, they’re micro-formations and only along lines of flight, or what amounts to the same, lines of decoding, of deterritorialization. The unconscious constantly deterritorializes itself; there are endless lines, lines of flight, abstract lines—again, neither symbolic, nor figurative, nor imaginary, nothing of the sort—lines of flight marked out with machinic indices. The only thing noteworthy about dreams is that they’re full of machinic indices. In dreams and fantasy, we get nothing but indices of desiring machines, and we get them in the form of molar machines; as often as daddies-mommies appear in dreams, so too do machinic indices. It isn’t a desiring machine because desiring machines aren’t dreamt, but they’re machinic indices. All the time, in fantasies, little machines appear; you have to follow their escape routes [<em>voies de fuite</em>] to get out of dream analysis; you have to delve into these kinds of machinic lines in order to go further.</p><p>— Alongside the work of scraping everything out, the sort of violent countermeasure to the unconscious pseudo-formations that have to be ruthlessly destroyed, stamped out, and the main positive task of uncovering desiring machines, the second positive task—there are criteria if you follow the lines of flight as far as you can—the second task is uncovering the nature of the social field’s unconscious investments, granted that the social field’s preconscious investments don’t work the same way. You could have rather revolutionary preconscious investments and still have paranoid, reactionary unconscious investments. What analysis needs is some equivalent to the revolution of abstract painting—that is, it needs to reach parts of the unconscious that are no longer figurative or symbolic: a molecular, abstract, machinic unconscious.</p><p>A student [<em>comment about Schreber’s father</em>]: It doesn’t start with the father’s generation; we have to go up a level (the grandmother), which is also quite something (dreaming of having a “real” man). You get the sense that it’s the paranoiac’s father who should be committed, and not his delusional son (delirium being the imaginary resolution of his fantasies). The one driving things is perfectly socially integrated, and it’s in that sense that he has delusions about the whole social field and then afterwards applies it to his son—but he’s firmly planted in his social field, which is why he avoids getting sent to the asylum. Whereas those who end up in the asylum, like paranoiacs, are those who aren’t connected enough to be spurred on by familial investments; there’s a barrier that absolutely prevents them from having any delusion about the social field. It takes three generations to make someone paranoid; as for schizos, who’s to say?</p><p>Deleuze: I take issue with your wording, but that’s beside the point. If there were only paranoiacs, there never would have been asylums. The paranoiac gets along fine. The paranoiacs who do get hospitalized are either really poor, so they think they’re little leaders, or else it’s because of schizoid elements that always get mixed in with paranoia. If they’re hospitalized, it’s certainly not because of their paranoia; it’s owing to some latent schizoid element, lying beneath the paranoia.</p><p>[Maud] Mannoni’s argument about the decision on Schreber’s case as the first act of anti-psychiatry misses the mark, since the reason Schreber was released was that his schizophrenic elements did not prevail.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-04-11/#_edn5 rel=noopener>5</a> I’m reminded of another case, perhaps the opposite of Schreber’s, of someone with quite pronounced paranoid aspects and even more pronounced schizophrenic tendencies: Nijinsky, the dancer. No way the court would let Nijinsky go free—he went around shouting, “I am the clown of God, death to the Stock Market, the Stock Market is death, money is death!”
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-04-11/#_edn6 rel=noopener>6</a>  You could argue that saying that is unreasonable since it was just said here.</p><p>With rich paranoiacs, it’s great; they have a fundamental social function. The paranoiac is well integrated, and no one who’s paranoid will get committed to an asylum unless they fall into one of those two categories.</p><p>My second point addresses matters regarding the three family members. Looking at the three generations, we find with the most ardent anti-psychiatrists—Gisela Pankow, [R.D.] Laing, [David] Cooper—what do we end up with? When it comes to psychosis, the Oedipus complex obviously falls apart, so the question is how to salvage Oedipus. As [Guy] Rosalato naively puts it: “How do we bring psychosis back into an Oedipal framework?”
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-04-11/#_edn7 rel=noopener>7</a> Posed in that way, the problem can play out in one of several ways. We can take a structuralist route—which isn’t at all what Lacan is doing—we can use structuralism to form a structural Oedipus complex and figure out where psychosis fits into said structure. Or—these aren’t mutually exclusive—we can extend Oedipus. If the Oedipus complex doesn’t work, we widen it a bit, i.e., we bring in the grandmother, the grandfather; we argue that Oedipus no longer involves two generations but three. We’ll have to account for the grandfather. If that doesn’t work, we’ll bring in a fourth generation.</p><p>If I’m privileging the role of the father or the role of the grandfather, it’s certainly not for the sake a new take on Oedipus. At a certain point, I could ask: what comes first, the father or the child? That is, the chicken-or-egg questions doesn’t make any sense—but at the same time, it must be addressed. The father or mother comes before the child. If I claim that the father has primacy over the child, that can be interpreted in one of two ways. [First,] regressively, as an infinite regress—every child has a father—we can keep climbing further and further back up to the presupposition of a first father, the Father of the primal horde, for example. But there’s another, completely different way of interpreting it, in a way where we don’t get caught up in an indefinite familial reduction. It could mean—and this is where the question becomes nonsense—what comes first is actually the social field covering both father and child, who are simultaneously immersed in said social-historical field. In truth, the idea that the father has primacy over the child means that social investments come before familial investments.</p><p>That means understanding the unconscious as a cycle, as per Marx’s well-known response to Aristotle regarding the “cause of man [<em>sic</em>]”—yes, but there’s a cycle, the cycle whereby man produces man. The unconscious of desiring machines is a cyclical unconscious. Accounts of schizophrenogenic families fail to explain anything about how schizophrenia is produced; the most ordinary family mechanisms get portrayed as schizophrenogenic mechanisms. The father has primacy over the child, but not <em>as</em> a father—it’s that the social field and social investments have primacy over father and son.</p><p>Why do we only find indices of the little desiring machines that invest the entire social field? These machinic lines of flight are necessarily lines of deterritorialization as such, because deterritorialization is like the inverse or opposite of the movements of reterritorialization. Even Beckett’s most extreme protagonists can’t completely deterritorialize themselves; they integrate small patches of land
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-04-11/#_edn8 rel=noopener>8</a>, Malone’s room, a trash can. The movement of deterritorialization can only be grasped through the gene and the nature of the reterritorializations carried out by an individual.</p><p>It’s always by way of a reterritorialization’s countermovement that we can determine the degree of deterritorialization. For example, the neurotic has already found a foothold to cling onto: Oedipus. The analyst’s couch is the second thing that won’t budge, the bit of land one must cling to—otherwise everything gets rocky.</p><p>We have to demonstrate how capitalism never stops deterritorializing and, with its axiomatics, reterritorializing. For example, fascism was a process of reterritorializing the masses, however terrible. You can only read someone’s deterritorialization—and how far it’s gone—that is, someone’s schizophrenic terror, through their counter-terrors, the reterritorializations they carry out. That’s why we shouldn’t think of perverts in terms of their impulses. We should think of them in terms of their territory: perverts are folks who want neither the territoriality of Oedipus nor the territoriality of the couch. That won’t do—they invent artificial territory, artificial groups. They have their own way of reterritorializing themselves, and if all else fails, as a last resort, you reterritorialize yourself as a body without organs, i.e., lying catatonic in the hospital, the poorest territory of all. You’ve recreated your little foothold.</p><p>What matters is that the movement of deterritorialization isn’t simply susceptible to getting taken up in a perverse reterritorialization, be it psychoanalytic or perverse in the strict sense, but that the movement of deterritorialization is strong enough to—cleaving to its revolutionary lines of flight—create for itself a new type of land. Perhaps that’s what Nietzsche means when he says that one day “the earth shall become a place of healing.”
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-04-11/#_edn9 rel=noopener>9</a> Perhaps, rather than being reterritorialized on artificial land, under certain conditions, the movement of deterritorialization might come to be the creator of a new earth. It would be nice, at any rate.</p><p>Eric: Three generations are relevant. It doesn’t go any further than that. There’s been a psychotic episode—there must be a mechanism there linking it to something, the “name of the father,” triggering the patient’s hospital psychosis. The same way you distinguish between schizophrenia and hospital schizophrenia, there’s also a difference between psychosis and hospital psychosis. Hence Lacan’s work, which demonstrates the role of exclusion, which is linked to the father in a certain way—not the real father, but the father as an investment of the social field—in this idea of hospital paranoia.</p><p>Deleuze: We’ll have to pick back up on this next week. I disagree.</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p><a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-04-11/#_ednref1 rel=noopener>1</a> Per Hurley, Seem, and Lane’s translation, <em>ensemble</em> here has been translated as “aggregate.” See, for example, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, <em>Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia,</em> trans.

We are perpetually in situations tangential to the schizophrenic process, and we can say that everything is psychosis because, ultimately, even when it comes to other territorialities, what is in question through it is the body without organs; and as long as, in any analysis, we will not have reached the repulsion mechanisms of the body without organs, we will have done nothing.</p></blockquote><p><em>In yet another fragmentary session, solely with responses by Deleuze to students’ questions, first, regarding contrasts between community psychiatry versus institutional analysis, which includes group psychotherapy, shifting the focus briefly to reflect on which writers present a perverted text (Raymond Roussel, who invents a territoriality and group) versus a psychotic text (Antonin Artaud). To another query about what authentic reterritorialization would be, Deleuze sidesteps this to ask whether deterritorialization might create a new land [<em>nouvelle terre</em>], but the transcript omits his complete response. Responding to a student who seems to see “the real as sexed”, Deleuze agrees but also opens this possibility to bisexuality, and he maintains that the main distribution point arises in the human representation of sexuality culminating in the phallus as principle, this representation being an illusion that consciousness forms about the unconscious. To a proposal that one can still think difference as life and death, as real otherness, Deleuze considers the death drive as a Freudian trick, but he also argues that one would need to discuss the relationship of death and desiring machines. This discussion continues actively between several students with Deleuze, but ultimately Deleuze interprets the comments as agreeing with his own, i.e., desexualization as the operation whereby some portion of the libido is desexualized and moves over to the death drive, hence a middle term through which the libido passes while moving toward other investments. The session’s fragmentary nature is confirmed as it ends in mid-sentence with a student speaking.</em></p><p>…[either that or] community psychiatry, i.e., a sort of adaptation police force, as Mrs. [Maud] Mannoni says, where you get split up into districts or sectors—that is, you get oedipalized (Hochman’s work).
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-05-10/#_edn1 rel=noopener>1</a> The point is to triangulate people as much as possible, extending the triangular relationship beyond the family. For those not doing community psychiatry, there are three fundamental problems—institutional analysis, for example, uses group psychotherapy.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-05-10/#_edn2 rel=noopener>2</a></p><p>What’s risky about group psychotherapy—I’m not trying to criticize psychiatry as though individual psychiatrists had to find everything on their own; there needs to be a mass movement behind it. An individual psychiatrist can’t be expected to figure it out on their own—they’re well aware that lots of things can go wrong with their groups. Sometimes the group ends up being just perverts—a pervert slips in, pretty dangerous, everyone is dangerous except for me—neurotics pose the greatest risk. They won’t let you go until they pass their stuff onto you: they’re contagious <em>par excellence</em>. Better to have ten times as many schizos [<em>sic</em>] than a single neurotic, since a schizo will leave you alone. A neurotic person is the spitting image of what Nietzsche calls a “toxic patient.” They’ll do whatever they can to get their vampire fangs in you—they can’t bear the fact that you <em>aren’t</em> depressed or depressive.</p><p>One of the potential risks with institutional analysis is that its group therapy sessions might be infiltrated by perverts, perverting the whole group, or—which isn’t any better—the group might be oedipalized, neuroticized, with a group superego, a group father, or at worst,
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-05-10/#_edn3 rel=noopener>3</a> [group therapy risks] reconstituting so-called catatonic schizophrenia, and the most open groups an asylum structure will form around catatonic schizophrenics. How do you prevent any of these three sorts of groups from forming? When a pervert starts working a group over from the inside, or starts oedipalizing at top speed—the risks are clear.</p><p>The pervert falls under the third [?] category; they’re proud, and want to [be] treated as an equal, on an even playing field. It isn’t about drive, or whatever; it’s about desire’s place in relation to territorialities. There’s an insane fear of madness and catatonia. They’ve over-adapted; it made them cold inside. No matter the perversion, what all perverts have in common, I think, [is] this two-fold aspect of over-comfort, over-adaptation—I don’t think there are many perverts—that manifests as a sort of joviality, but not at all as some psychotic euphoria. You have to be wary and can’t trust your little girl, and at the same time, you get the feeling that they’ve been hollowed out—a little shard of ice behind the massive armor of their over-adaptation. What do they do with it? The perverse body is certainly no longer catatonic; it’s what Sade calls apathy, the sadistic apathy Klossowski famously focused on so much. Either that or the explicit theory of coldness we find in the anti-Sade, in Masoch. [The pervert] doesn’t want a territoriality like Oedipus. “It’s beneath me.” They’re proud. They don’t want a sub-aggregate.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-05-10/#_edn4 rel=noopener>4</a> They build themselves magnificent territorialities—[Raymond Roussel’s] <em>Impressions of Africa</em> is a perverted text. <em>
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-05-10/#_edn5 rel=noopener>**[5]**</a></em> The definitive text on the body without organs and catatonic-psychotic territorialization is Schreber, it’s Artaud. Most writing is run-of-the-mill neurosis.</p><p><em>Impressions of Africa</em> [by Raymond Roussel] is about constructing an exotic, artificial territoriality, which, from the depths of its coldness and over-comfort, will claim to be on equal footing with any other power. The pervert has invented their territoriality, their group, their secret society—it has nothing to do with a drive; everything is neurosis, everything is psychosis. You could say that everything is a schizophrenic process, only not in the same way, fortunately. Everything is schizophrenic process insofar as every other aspect is defined in relation to [schizophrenia].</p><p>We perpetually find ourselves situated tangentially to the schizophrenic process. We could say that everything is psychosis because, ultimately, even when it comes to other territorialities, what’s at stake is the body without organs. And in any analysis, you haven’t done anything until you get to the repulsing mechanisms of the body without organs. And then, we could say that everything is neurosis insofar as it is the only sickness, and all sicknesses are defined in relation to the neurosis of Oedipus and castration, because Oedipus is the primary frame of reference, the primary means for recoding [<em>recodage</em>].
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-05-10/#_edn6 rel=noopener>6</a> And the psychotic is someone who refuses Oedipus, who says, “Better the desert of my body without organs than Oedipal territoriality. I’d rather say nothing than say ‘daddy-mommy.’” And the pervert is someone whose way of relating themselves to Oedipus is to say, “I would be so ashamed.” In that sense, everything is neurosis.</p><p>And everything is also perversion, since perversion is the archetypical model of reterritorialization: with how perversion operates, we see the creation of artificial territorialities, of so-called perverse groups, recognizing that the schizophrenic process isn’t the same thing as clinical schizophrenia [<em>Responding to Eric</em>].</p><p>How is clinical schizophrenia produced?</p><p>Student: What would authentic reterritorialization be?</p><p>Deleuze: You’re skipping ahead. We’re not going to ever make the mistake of saying, “Ah, the good old days, when the earth [<em>terre</em>] was real earth.” Capitalism—I forget who said it—was about neo-archaisms, i.e., restoring what appear to be archaisms but with modern functions, returning to the land [<em>terre</em>], for example. It’s only apparently archaic; it’s a neo-archaism because it actually has a perfectly current function for the societies bringing it back.</p><p>The third [?] point would be to ask the question: Is the process of deterritorialization itself—not insofar as it gets reterritorialized in a factitious or artificial way in capitalism—is it capable of creating new land [<em>terre</em>], or something equivalent to new land? Is it possible to create new land? That remains to be seen; it comes back to the problem of revolution… [<em>Continuing his response to Laurent</em>]</p><p>Deleuze: You say the real as sexed. For me, even with your stipulated conditions, I would agree. For me it gets tricky when we ask, what sexuality are we talking about? You mentioned human sexuality, but that isn’t just Oedipus. It’s also a bisexuality, that is, there are men and there are women. There’s also the assertion that castration is valid for both sexes. All that together: Oedipus, sexual difference, castration, as the source of difference, the main distributer of Oedipus. Together they define, not sexuality, but the anthropomorphic representation of sex.</p><p>What I’m getting at is that there is no human sexuality; the only thing human is a representation of sexuality. It’s the anthropomorphic representation of sex that culminates in the phallus: the phallus is the fundamental principle of the anthropomorphic representation of sex. The question isn’t whether it exists but how it exists, how it works. I’m asking whether this anthropomorphic representation of sex is a determination of the unconscious, or an element of the preconscious, or even an illusion consciousness has of the unconscious. Is the castration machine, the phallic machine and its oedipal offspring, part of an illusion consciousness is led to form about the unconscious? Schizo-analysis has to reach non-human sex… [<em>text missing</em>]</p><p>… It seems to me that any introduction, even indirectly, of chains of foreclosure, of lack, of the name of the father, would fall back onto an anthropomorphic representation of sex. So, I’m not all that receptive to the question of “sexual undifferentiation.” It’s not a real problem; it’s the existence of <em>n</em> sexes, that statistically there are good men and good women, as molar aggregates. At the molecular level of schizo-analysis or the delirious unconscious, it’s impossible to distinguish a man from a woman—certainly not owing to some bisexuality, which does nothing to distance us from anthropomorphic representation—but at a completely different level, the level of <em>n</em>, little ‘<em>n</em>’ sexes. There, distinguishing man or woman is absolutely impossible. In anthropomorphic representation, there are men and women; when it comes to non-human sex, there’s neither man nor woman.

There’s a level of sexuality, the relationships between <em>n</em> sexes have this sort of character. Homosexuality, heterosexuality, man, woman—it’s lost all meaning. Words that can be used in one context and not in another. At the level of non-human sex, there’s no name of the father, no foreclosure, no castration, no… and so on. In these contexts, those things don’t exist. It doesn’t describe the unconscious; it’s part of the image that consciousness forms of the unconscious. In fact, under the name of the father, you find Joan of Arc, President Schreber, Mao—names from history.</p><p>Richard Pinhas: Would you agree that… and I’m on board with what you said about difference and how we think about castration. In the system you’re describing as the anthropomorphic representation of sex, [there are] like oppositions, simple oppositions in a positivity, and on the other side, you have difference—that is, we can no longer think of difference as sexual difference, but difference still exists—a difference other than opposition. I’d opt to think of it in terms of life and death, through a Freudian lens: the constancy principle and the nirvana principle, average tension and absolute zero; that’s ultimately what life and death is. What if we took that as real otherness, as difference in the face of castration, which we could consider an opposition only within the same unity?</p><p>Deleuze: No, I wouldn’t agree—any time we’re dealing with difference, what matters to me is the number of terms involved. If there are two terms at play, it seems to me it would inherently depend on anthropomorphic representation—unless we’re working with <em>n</em> terms, where “man” and “woman” have lost all meaning, strictly speaking.</p><p>Pinhas: That doesn’t work with life and death.</p><p>Deleuze: Well, in that case, sure, but life and death… then death is going to bring us back to…</p><p>Pinhas: Real death!</p><p>Deleuze: Should I ask what you mean by real?</p><p>Pinhas: When it stops flowing…</p><p>Deleuze: We haven’t even touched on the role death plays in this. For me, the question would come down to the relationship between death and desiring machines. But here, again, I don’t think I’m all that Freudian, i.e., the death drive still strikes me as horrible, like some nasty trick played on the unconscious.</p><p>Student: On the power of affect being measured in <em>n</em> gradients…</p><p>Deleuze: Yes, exactly—they’re “names in history,” big gradient operators. If the body without organs is a plenitude, it’s because it spreads itself out. It’s effectively the intensity = 0 on the basis of which all the intensities of the unconscious are produced—non-figurative intensities, intensities that don’t represent anything, but which are designated by names in history.</p><p>This level of zero intensity is where death comes in. In other words, contrary to what Freud says, there is no death drive, but there is a model. Freud says the opposite: there is a drive but no model.</p><p>Pinhas: We might find a model of death, a representation or rather a glimpse into what death might be—in <em>jouissance</em>, in orgasm.</p><p>Deleuze: That’s not [what we find in] Freud’s <em>Inhibitions, Symptoms, and Anxiety.</em> There is a death drive, and there is no death model.</p><p>Richard Zrehen: If you have a body without organs that’s full, indeed, a death drive is out of the question. Only when your body without organs is full, but [there’s some] middle ground afterwards where you can indeed have a death drive, [but] you can’t maintain both, so you logically exclude…</p><p>Deleuze: So, there isn’t any…</p><p>Zrehen: … that’s where there’s a major disagreement: it isn’t exactly a life force. What he meant was that when we think about these terms in terms of life and death, it isn’t a symmetrical difference. There’s precisely a divide that goes so far it can’t be pinned down to anything, and it’s because of that that no model is possible, that whenever we try to talk about it, we can’t help but be reductive. We say, “stuff gets out of the system,” or we’ll say, “there’s something that gets out of the system,” and we talk about it, and we end up back with Lacan. That’s the real threshold in store for us, the way you portrayed capitalism, how whenever capitalism reaches its limit it pushes it further away. Here, it’s the other way around: every time we get our hands on the ungraspable, whenever we get it up close, it becomes grasped—and we have to look even further. We might largely disagree about fullness without lack. Perhaps it’s no longer a lack; it’s something else. Something more radical, something unattributable to a subject. A death drive is not attributable to a subject, they aren’t tied together. It runs its course without any regard whatsoever. It isn’t assigned, it doesn’t provide—it just runs.</p><p>Deleuze: There’s an awful idea I’m trying to avoid. If it’s true that psychoanalysis and Freud completely missed desiring machines, the production of desire, i.e., everything that makes up unconscious life, that makes me feel pretty romantic, pretty vitalist. The truth of the matter is really on the side of [D.H.] Lawrence and [Henry] Miller; they’re the only ones who’ve understood anything about the unconscious.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-05-10/#_edn8 rel=noopener>8</a></p><p>After psychoanalysis screwed that up, it could only approach the essence of desire as something turned against life, and they did their thing with the death drive [<em>Deleuze sighs</em>]. It’s awful. This chapter of psychoanalysis is stained by a sort of death cult. [Wilhelm] Reich described it so well; it was all downhill from there. Reich’s <em>The Function of the Orgasm</em> is great: once they introduced the death drive, it just so happened that everyone stopped talking about libido and starting talking about Eros. It was all downhill from there—people were talking about Eros, and nobody talked about sexuality anymore. That’s not to say that the sort of anti-sexuality found in Jung and Adler primarily took place in high church Freudian psychoanalysis, and that the death drive was a way of conforming to conventional standards, which is what the death drive was used for.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-05-10/#_edn9 rel=noopener>9</a></p><p>Zrehen: Sexuality isn’t what’s important. We’re on the same page. When Freud does the death drive or Eros (see <em>An Outline of Psychoanalysis</em> [1938])… we land right back in the neo-Heyelianism [<em>sic</em>] of 1935, and when Reich is done, there’s Marcuse, and then it’s perfect; we’ll find reconciliation. Not only will we return to the earth, but we’ll be screwing in our cars (thank goodness!).</p><p>Pinhas: Freud says that the libido is on both sides, since the libido is the energy powering both Eros and the death drive, and the libido belongs to the reservoir of energy that is the self.</p><p>Deleuze: That isn’t so self-evident. That’s [Jean] Laplanche’s interpretation, and we need to look at Freud’s own writing. Personally, I can make out two key works: <em>Inhibitions, Symptoms, and Anxiety</em>—the parts where he attacks [Otto] Rank—and a great text of his, <em>The Ego and The Id</em>, where he explicitly says, “there isn’t any immediate conversion of energy; I maintain a dualism between drives.” And monism would be romanticizing the unconscious—he insists on dualism. His dualism precludes any direct conversion from one type of energy to another. Any direct transformations happen within libidinal energy; at no point is there a direct energetic conversion between the libidinal drives then labeled as Eros—bizarrely, you could very well object that it doesn’t matter, but it matters quite a bit—and death drives. No direct conversion. Any conversion takes place via what Freud calls desexualization, whereby he claims to reestablish his annoying concept of sublimation. What I’m saying is that, if it’s true that the death drive doesn’t have its own energy—as Laplanche claims, or as you seem to claim—then I can no longer make heads or tails of these passages. Because if the death drive doesn’t have its own energy, I fail to see why this stage of desexualization is necessarily, or why Freud thinks direct transformations are impossible.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-05-10/#_edn10 rel=noopener>10</a></p><p>Pinhas: That’s easy enough to explain [<em>Laughter</em>]. We can’t forget that for Freud, first in <em>Inhibitions, Symptoms, and Anxiety</em> and then in <em>An Outline</em>—he picks these ideas back up in <em>An Outline</em>—he says: now, I said this, then afterward I said that, but in the end, I’m convinced that it’s this. You know Freud’s style of exposition. Now, why there is desexualization: the energy that gets desexualized is what will transform—“transform” is a bad way of putting it, a poor metaphor—into Eros because it gets sublimated, Freud says. But what that means is that it turns into something socially and culturally invested. We go from an individual and family register to one that’s fully cultural. That doesn’t mean there isn’t always this libidinal reservoir belonging to the ego, which, following a very rough outline, distributes energy to the death drives and to Eros, energy which converts to Eros. I don’t know, then, whether there’s a part that remains as it is and another part that gets desexualized. But there definitely is a big part that is desexualized, in order to constitute higher, ever more complex units. Right, but that’s not the case with the death drive. The death drive stays that way; it has energy, and it uses it.</p><p>Deleuze: Desexualization, he tells us—explicitly, as I see it—is accomplished by transferring an amount of libidinal energy it has worked on, desexualized, into the death drive; the death drive is thereby transformed, right, but desexualization, the operation whereby some portion of the libido is desexualized and moves over to the death drive. Thus, what’s missing is the middle term which ensuring that its conversion is indirect; we need desexualization as this middle term. For me, that says it all. Everything you just said amounts to saying: yes, for Freud, the libido—the sexual libido—falls under the domain of the ego, daddy-mommy, Oedipus, and beyond that, the libido must go through desexualization to carry out other investments. Which is what I’ve been saying from the start. That’s what I think is confining the libido, its broad mystification. You might think he’s right, then, but we’re in total agreement on how to interpret these texts.</p><p>Pinhas: We’ll see next week. I believe that through mediation [<em>Laughter</em>] as a means of exposure, of making things mobile, we’ll be able to account for the death drive. [<em>End of lecture.

He suggests that both systems work to decode flows of desire or capital, only to recode them in a different form. This process is seen in the way psychoanalysis decodes the flows of desire in the unconscious, only to recode them in terms of Oedipus and castration.</p></li><li><p><strong>Desiring Machines and the Body without Organs</strong>: Deleuze discusses the concept of desiring machines, which he describes as the productive forces of desire. He contrasts this with the concept of the Body without Organs, which he describes as an unproductive, non-organismic entity that is produced within the desiring-production process</p></li><li><p><strong>Critique of Oedipus and Castration</strong>: Deleuze criticizes psychoanalysis for its reliance on the concepts of Oedipus and castration. He argues that these concepts are not inherent to the unconscious but are imposed upon it by psychoanalysis. He suggests that the unconscious operates not through Oedipal structures or castrative processes, but through desiring-production.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Unconscious and Desire</strong>: Deleuze proposes a different understanding of the unconscious and desire. He suggests that the unconscious is not a theatre of representation (as in Freudian psychoanalysis) but a factory of production. Desire is not linked to lack or prohibition (as in Oedipal psychoanalysis) but is a positive, productive force.</p></li><li><p><strong>Schizophrenia and Capitalism</strong>: Deleuze draws parallels between schizophrenia and capitalism. He suggests that both involve processes of decoding and recoding, deterritorialization and reterritorialization. Schizophrenia is seen as a process that subverts the codes and territories of capitalism, creating lines of flight that escape capitalist control.</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>In this respect, psychoanalysis belongs to capitalism no less than the merchant, no less than the banker, no less than the industrialist. There is an extraordinarily precise role at the very level of the capitalist economy; if there is a justification for the very curious circuit of money in psychoanalysis, because there at least, all the justifications regarding money and the role of money in psychoanalysis, everyone laughs, it’s great because it both works and nobody believes in it. But we don’t need to believe it; it’s like in capitalism, there is no longer any need to believe in anything. The codes need belief, the axiomatic absolutely not, we could care less.</p></blockquote><p><em><strong>Another session starting in progress focuses initially on the intersection of psychoanalytical concepts with Marxist analysis, hence material developed in chapter III of <em>Anti-Oedipus</em>, but also the framework of schizo-analysis already proposed in previous sessions. Deleuze continues to insist on understanding the unconscious rather in terms of political economy, and specifically concerning “objectities”, i.e. the objects to which economists attached importance for wealth (land for the Physiocrats, the State for mercantilists). As capitalism functions through the axiomatic, always reterritorializing, it matters little if one believes in this assemblage; it still functions through the real flow of finance and revenues, in both domains. Hence, Deleuze considers the psychoanalytical reliance on figures such as Oedipus, i.e., on tragedy and myths, and following a student’s comments, Deleuze adds Claude Lévi-Strauss to the Freud-Ricardo duo</strong>, notably his discovery in ethnology of the incest prohibition which he reinserts into the system of lineage. Following a missing segment, Deleuze’s focus jumps to how intensities function at a cellular level, with trips and passages, the egg’s movement similar to the schizo’s stroll, i.e., becomings in intensity. Here Artaud serves as stating that the organism is the enemy of the body without organs, whereas the schizo stroll encompasses passages through zones, and Deleuze again proposes the egg as this pre-organic, undifferentiated zone of intensity from which the extensive migration proceeds. To another query regarding Deleuze sharing with Lacan the idea that a structure only functions as a machinic element and not a structural element, Deleuze argues that this is evident in the context of analysis where the analyst, rather than invent these structures, confirms them, whereas the unconscious ignores Oedipus and castration entirely which are conscious projections on the unconscious. The session ends abruptly, presumably with the recording excluding additional discussion.</em></p><p><strong>Libido and labor as subjective activities and their re-alienation – psychoanalysis and myth – bodies without organs and intensities</strong></p><p>… It would be a disaster if I came up with a theory of the unconscious. For me, it’s really a practical problem: how does the unconscious function? And what I’m saying is that the way it works has never been about Oedipus, about castration or the death drive; I’m say all that gets introduced by psychoanalysis. There’s a process that makes psychoanalysis fundamentally a part of capitalism—and again, I don’t mean ideologically; I strictly mean in terms of practice. When Marx asks, “What lies at the root of political economy?”—a problem Foucault revisits in <em>The Order of Things</em>—Marx’s answer is that political economy really begins with Adam Smith and Ricardo because before them, to understand the nature of wealth, one looked at what we could call the object, objectity [<em>objectité</em>]. At which point we didn’t have political economy; we had something else, an analysis of wealth. The nature of wealth was bound up with major objectities—the land, for physiocrats; the state, for mercantilists.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-06-10/#_edn1 rel=noopener>1</a></p><p>What’s going on with this major revolution in political economy at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century with Smith and Ricardo? Marx says it best: with the development of capitalism, one no longer looked for the nature of wealth in terms of objectities but, in a radical about-face—a sort of Kantian transformation at the level of political economy—it came back to the subject. Back to the subject, what does that mean? Smith and Ricardo, he says, did what Luther did in the world of religion: instead of tying religiosity to major objectities, they turned it around in order to relate it to the subject, to subjective faith. Ricardo locates the nature or essence of wealth alongside the subject as a productive activity, as an act of production, any act whatsoever. Hence Marx’s beautiful turn of phrase: “It was an immense step forward for Adam Smith to attribute the essence of wealth to productive activity in general, without privileging any form of production over another. Agricultural production was no longer privileged. And it took the conditions of industrial labor, that is, the development of capitalism, for the nature of wealth to be turned around and be revealed to belong to productive activity in general, for the essence of wealth to prop up this conversion and be discovered on the side of general productive activity, and it is on that basis that political economic was founded.”
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-06-10/#_edn2 rel=noopener>2</a></p><p>In <em>The Order of Things</em>, Foucault revisits this in another form, looking for what constituted the birth of political economy. With A. Smith and Ricardo, we found in the subjective act of production something irreducible to the domain of representation. It’s rather clear this epistemological change transforming the domain of knowledge, steering towards a knowledge bearing on the non-representative: productive activity insofar as it subtends, passes through representation.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-06-10/#_edn3 rel=noopener>3</a></p><p>What does Freud do? Before, the insane were linked to major objectities—the madman of the earth, the madman of the despot. The same goes for wealth; wealth referred back to objective entities. 19th century psychiatry undergoes a rather similar transformation to what Ricardo undertook with political economy. This transformation takes off, that is, madness is no longer linked to great objectities, but to a general subjective activity. What activity? Things break loose with Freud, which is why the divide isn’t between Freud and 19th century psychiatry. Freud—just like the major reversal whereby Ricardo discovers the abstract nature of wealth, by no longer relating wealth to objectities but to a general, unqualified act of production, which allows him to discover abstract labor.</p><p>Freud does the same thing. Freud is Ricardo; he’s Smith; he’s the Ricardo of psychiatry. He discovers the abstract nature of desire, and it’s no longer alongside major objectities— the madman of the earth or the madman of the despot. He finds it in the subjective activity of desire. He calls this subjective activity, or abstract essence, the “libido”—and this libido will have goals, sources, and objects. But Freud recognizes that the libido is more than its goals, sources, and objects. These objects, sources, and goals are still ways of attributing desire to objectities, to territories. On a deeper level, the libido is a subjective activity of desire. From that angle, Freud and Ricardo are the same. Their similarities don’t stop there; it goes even further.</p><p>Marx has more to say: he says that they revealed the essence of wealth as the general activity of production, and they call such general productive activity “abstract labor.” The Freudian equivalent is only a few steps away: he uncovers the general activity of desire, and his name for it is abstract libido. But, but, but—the similarities go further, because then, both Freud and Ricardo do something funny. Marx puts it well: “But as soon as Ricardo identifies the essence of wealth as productive activity in general, he keeps re-alienating it.”
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-06-10/#_edn4 rel=noopener>4</a> What does that mean? There’s no more objectity; that’s a given. But this productive activity will be alienated all over again. Does that mean Ricardo is reinstating big, objective representations and retreating to previous alienations? No. It comes down to inventing a sort of mystification for what they just discovered. Namely, Marx tells us, whereas before, wealth and labor were alienated in objectities, i.e., as states (as in a state of affairs), now they take on a new form of alienation, to wit, a specifically subjective alienation corresponding to their subjective discovery. They get alienated as activities rather than as states, rather than alienating as an objective state of affairs. They’re alienated as a subjective act, lining up with what they’ve revealed to be a subjective essence. Marx spells it out: from there, alienation will no longer be understood as and limited to an objective state of affairs; it will be grasped in its very act. What act? They’ll alienate labor again, as the subjective essence of production; they’ll re-alienate it under the conditions of private property.</p><p>Freud discovers the abstract libido, it sparks huge transformation: desire must no longer be understood in terms of its objects, nor in terms of its goals. It ought to be understood as libido. But Freud re-alienates this discovery on a new basis, corresponding to his own discovery; the new basis for the alienation of the subjective activity of desire, understood as libido, is under the subjective conditions of the family, which leads to Oedipus. Psychoanalysis is a sub-set of capitalism, which is why, in certain respects, all of capitalism is folded into psychoanalysis. In what sense? Ricardo says, “Alright, boys—I’ve discovered productive activity in general, but look out: private property ought to be the measure for this general productive activity, the essence of which I’ve attributed to the subject.” And Freud does much the same: we don’t get out of the family.</p><p>Why is it that way? Why couldn’t it be otherwise? Why is that fundamentally a part of both psychoanalysis and capitalism? There are two movements that always co-exist within capitalism. On the one hand, [you have] the decoding and deterritorialization of flows, the subjective activity that’s been uncovered. But at the same time, things constantly reterritorialize, neo-territorialize. Despite appearances, that doesn’t consist in resurrecting the body of the earth as an objectity, nor the body of the despot as an objectity, except at a local level. There is local despotism, but that’s not what this is. Reterritorialization doesn’t just mean resurrecting pure archaisms, i.e., bygone objectities; reterritorialization should be subjective. On the one hand, it first takes place under the conditions of private property, which is political economy, and a second time in the modern subjective family, which is psychoanalysis. It needs both. What’s come about is the process of reterritorializing abstract activity.</p><p>In this respect, psychoanalysis is as much a part of capitalism as merchants, bankers, industrialists. It plays an incredibly precise role in capitalist economies. If there’s any justification for the peculiar exchange of money in psychoanalysis—because everyone jokes about the justifications for money and how it fits into psychoanalysis—it’s great because it works, and at the same time, no one believes it. But you don’t have to believe in it. It’s like in capitalism: you don’t have to believe in anything anymore. Codes need belief—absolutely not so with axiomatics; who cares?</p><p>The way money is exchanged in psychoanalysis is a lesser version of what we find in capitalism. The whole capitalist machine operates thanks to money’s being double-sided:  as financial flows and payment flows. They’re completely different flows, and both are folded into money; the incommensurability of these flows is a necessary condition for the capitalist machine to function. In psychoanalysis, there’s a financing flow and a payment flow, and ultimately the psychoanalytic machine works thanks to both flows, whose dualism is concealed.</p><p>For example, say a woman goes in for analysis. In many cases, the analyst will have no trouble revealing conflicts with her husband, and at the same time, the husband is the one paying for the analysis. In which case, the financing flow that stems from the husband, the payment that goes from the woman to her analyst—how do you expect her to get out? The analyst is blissfully indifferent to where the money comes from; when it comes time to justify his fees, the question “Who’s paying?” never arises. It’s a funny sort of loop where, literally, it’s just like the back-and-forth of deterritorialization and reterritorialization.</p><p>I’m thinking about the psychoanalytic attitude towards myth and tragedy, because in the end, it’s no coincidence that they turned to Oedipus. Did old Freud discover the Oedipus complex in his self-analysis, as everyone says, or did he find it in his culture? His culture was Goethean. He likes Goethe, he reads him at night. Is he pulling it from Sophocles or from his self-analysis?</p><p>A capitalist regime doesn’t require anyone to believe. What is required of them? Something that applies to capitalism as much as it does to the Roman empire, which Nietzsche captured so definitively in his depiction of people of the time, in what he calls a “motley painting of everything that has ever been believed”—everything that’s been the subject of belief is fit for reterritorializing. Like the Romans: we’ll take your God and set him up in Rome, so you get reterritorialized onto Roman land. Capitalism, too: over there is a feathered serpent—very well, the serpent’s coming with us.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-06-10/#_edn5 rel=noopener>5</a></p><p>What about psychoanalysis’s peculiar attitude towards myth? There’s an article by [Didier] Anzieu on the subject.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-06-10/#_edn6 rel=noopener>6</a> He says there are stages. It’s smooth sailing at first—all myths get analyzed; every myth, every tragedy gets thoroughly picked apart. And then that falls out of fashion; that’s what Jung does, so we don’t want to get mixed up with him. Why weren’t they ever included with ethnologists or Hellenists? There’s a reason for such immense ambiguity, such an immense misunderstanding.</p><p><strong>Student</strong>: And Lévi-Strauss—we have to explain how all myth analysis is picked up again after Freud, and any analysis of kinship is based on a kinship atom that determines the entire system of possible kinship, and this kinship atom is the [<em>audio unclear—perhaps “symbol”</em>] with a fourth term of either the brother or mother, which gets taken up by analysts like [M.C. and Edmond] Ortigues, claiming they’ve understood this fourth term to be symbolic. Lévi-Strauss is the one—which is why Lacan agrees with him on a bunch of points—the one who analyzed myth, and analysts don’t have to do it anymore.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-06-10/#_edn7 rel=noopener>7</a></p><p><strong>Deleuze</strong>: Then we should say it happens three times: there’s what Ricardo does in economics, what Freud does in psychiatry, and what Lévi-Strauss does in ethnology. Are we dissolving imaginary variations of the Oedipus complex while nevertheless maintaining a structure preserving the law-prohibition-transgression trinity? Oedipus isn’t preserved in the form of an abstract disfiguration.</p><p><strong>Student</strong>: Lévi-Strauss starts dismantling Oedipus by demonstrating that the story isn’t what matters; he analyzes it in order to then generalize its structure, through the structure of the kinship atom.</p><p><strong>Deleuze</strong>: Hmmm, hmmm. He discovered what he took to be ethnology’s most basic subjective activity, the prohibition of incest, and he re-alienated or folded it over into the kinship system.</p><p>Lastly: ethnologists and Hellenists are profoundly functionalist when they find themselves working with myth. What they really want to know is “How does this thing work?” And when they explain what a myth or tragedy means, they go about it as historians; they relate it to the objectities the myths refer to—the objectity of the earth, for example. And what else can they do, from their rigorous scientific point of view, other than explain, e.g., the role of a myth or oedipal ritual in the context of territorial objectities, despotic objectities? Lévi-Strauss on Oedipus, for example. He demonstrates that it simultaneously refers to a perpetuation of autochthony, the fact of territorial objectity, and to a failure of autochthony, the birth of despotic formations. Myths, tragedies are sent back to their objective references, and they’re right because [the myth, etc.] is about a particular century, a particular Greek city, etc. For them, interpreting myth and tragedy is unintelligible without this systematic framework of historical objectities.</p><p>From the outset, psychoanalysts have never been interested in historical objectities; what they’re trying to do is link myth and tragedy to the libido as a subjective activity, which is reflected in [Karl] Abraham’s naïve formulation: “myth dreams of humanity.”
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-06-10/#_edn8 rel=noopener>8</a> In other words, myths are analogous to dreams on a humanity-wide scale. They tie myth to the subjective activity of the libido, accounting for changes in the unconscious and for work done on the unconscious. Hence the rather ambiguous attitude psychoanalysis has towards myth, where one moment, it appeals to myth, and the next, it renounces it. They’re the first to ascribe myth and tragedy to the libido as their abstract, subjective essence, but at the same time—why do they keep myth and tragedy? It’s unbelievable what it’s gone through, [with respect to] understanding myth and tragedy as expressive units of the unconscious. How did they end up screwing around with myth and tragedy? How did they end up defining units of the unconscious in myths and tragedy?</p><p>Again, I’m asking from a clinical perspective: when a guy suffering from neurosis—or better yet, suffering from psychosis—Schreber comes along, and Freud says, “See, what he’s saying sounds like a myth.” Freud didn’t find it in his unconscious; he found it in all the bad readings he was feeding on. He thought, “Hang on, doesn’t this guy sound like Oedipus?” When a guy comes along, and things aren’t going well for him, it makes you feel like there’s a whole set of panicked, haywire machines. It’s like we’re in a garage, in a sabotaged factory where a wrench has suddenly been thrown in the works. Then—<em>Boom! Bang!</em>—it goes off all over the place; it’s a crazy factory, but it’s still a factory, and on top of that, Freud here comes along and says, “It’s a theater, it’s a myth”—we have to… [<em>text missing</em>]</p><p>Cell migration, for example, is when a group of cells cross a threshold. Thresholds are lines of intensity. It’s intensive matter before it’s an extended biological reality. The unfertilized egg, the non-active egg, is really an intensity = 0. I’m not speaking metaphorically when I say that it’s the catatonic body, the catatonic egg. As soon as it’s activated—all sorts of trajectories and transitions. Of course, these trajectories and transitions take place in extension, a group of cells migrating across the egg, but what do we find beneath their extensive path, their schizo promenade? There are transitions and becomings of a completely different nature, i.e., transitions and becomings in intensity. And that’s why I’m not on board with the anti-psychiatric habit of renouncing medication. Medication has two uses: one possible use for it is “This one’s bothering us, we need to calm him down,” and calming them down means bringing them as close as possible to zero intensity.  There are cases where psychiatrists intervene during an anxiety attack, and stopping it is catastrophic. But medicinal use can mean something else, as in drugs; a real psychiatric pharmacy comes down to ways of activating the egg—i.e., drugs can carry out transitions between one threshold of intensity and another, can guide its trajectory in intensity.</p><p>It <em>does</em> have a trajectory in extension, an extensive migration, but beneath that there’s a trajectory in intensity, i.e., on the body without organs, passing from one gradient to another, from one threshold of intensity to another. And that’s not the same thing as delirium or hallucination; it’s more fundamental—hallucinations and delirium are only secondary expressions of these intensive transitions. We go from one zone to another—strictly speaking, what does Judge Schreber mean when he says, “I’m growing real breasts”? What could that mean? It isn’t a hallucination, but he will have hallucinations based on it. Is it delirium? I don’t think so, but he will form delusions from it.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-06-10/#_edn9 rel=noopener>9</a></p><p>It’s the matrix that delusion and hallucination share. The female torso is literally there, on Schreber’s body without organs. It transitions, it follows astonishing trajectories—historical, geographical, biological developments—and at this level, again, all the flows mix together: historical flows, geographical flows. Because he only becomes a woman from a historical perspective, hence the necessity of defending Alsace, being a young Alsatian woman defending Alsace against France. Everything’s mixed together: the Judge’s becoming-woman combines with Alsace’s becoming-German again. The becoming-woman that Judge Schreber experiences physically follows a course in intensity. On his body without organs, he’s entered the being-woman gradient; he’s crossed over, reached another threshold—and these trajectories need to be helped along in extension, generally. Circling back to what I find so interesting about transvestites,
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-06-10/#_edn10 rel=noopener>10</a> they’re the ones where this journey, this trajectory, is the least metaphorical; they’re the ones who risk and are the most invested in a journey with no turning back—and they know it. You can think about it in terms of extension—they dress like a woman, they take hormones—but beneath that, they pass through thresholds of intensity.</p><p>To make sense of all these phenomena, we need to disorganize them, to unravel them, to bracket the reality of something we’re all too familiar with—the organism. Because the organism isn’t organs in a body. An organism is a coding [<em>codage</em>], a combinatorial [<em>combinatoire</em>]—the very same way we talk about a genetic code—of organs onto the body without organs. But my question is: as partial objects, do the organs not have a deeper, pre-organic relationship with the body without organs? This deeper, pre-organic relationship seems to entail abandoning any extensional point of view, i.e., organs are no longer territories with certain forms or certain functions. They are degrees of pure intensity. Embryology goes quite some distance in this regard: this gradient outlines the eye, that gradient outlines something else. They are thus intensive powers on the body without organs. But zero intensity is not the opposite of these intensive powers; it is the pure intensive matter that gets filled by intensive powers to one degree or another. That’s what I mean when I say that the body without organs and the organs are the same in their common struggle against their organism.</p><p>Artaud has does a marvelous job of highlighting that: the true enemy of the body without organs is the organism.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-06-10/#_edn11 rel=noopener>11</a> So, beneath the organism, having bracketed the organism, we can clearly see the relationship between organs as intensive powers that end up filling matter to varying degrees, to the point where, ultimately, the two are the same thing, strictly speaking. The schizophrenic journey or trajectory [<em>voyage</em>] is this way of passing through zones, and only subsequently does it take place in extension, in the form of going out on a walk or a journey—and only subsequently are there delusions and hallucinations. But there’s a reality beneath the hallucinations and under the delusions—the reality of “I feel.”</p><p>Back to the egg. Even before there are determinate organs, it isn’t simply undifferentiated—there are distributions in intensity, and these zones of intensity don’t at all resemble the organs that will eventually occupy them in extension. What outlines the blueprint for the eye is a gradient. Something happens when a group of cells moves from one area to another; it isn’t at all undifferentiated. But beneath this extensive migration, there’s a transition from one intensity to another, without organs having any distinct shape yet. Later, out of these migrations, we will be able to make out, in extension, the organs’ blueprints, and then the organs.</p><p><strong>Student</strong>: It isn’t enough to say there’s a difference between the body without organs and the organism—that’s obvious. Something more troubling is the idea that there are processes carried out on the body without organs. There are paranoid sorts of processes of repulsion, and [there is the] schizophrenic sorts of processes. But there’s one issue you haven’t brought up: if you think there’s a life of the unconscious, and that the life of the unconscious comes down to the function of desiring machines, and you tack on “and then” there is the body without organs, as a full, unproductive, and sterile body, you haven’t broached the subject of this body’s production itself, i.e., how is it that at some point in the life of the unconscious, things take a turn? Where does the body without organs come from? What process produces this full body? For Artaud, an even greater foe than the organism is God, Satan, the great thief. A delirium and an intensity—perhaps it works at the same time. Artaud, for example, literally felt annihilated, dispossessed by God, who robbed him of his life, to the point that Artaud says, “I’ve carried out a reversion toward the breast-matrix.” And to avoid this theft, Artaud initiates this reversal on his body without organs. How is it that such a body is able to come about?</p><p><strong>Deleuze</strong>: The relationship with God is rather straightforward. What Artaud calls God is the organizer of the organism. The organism is what codes, stifles flows; it’s what combines them, what axiomatizes them, and looking at it that way, God is the one who makes an organism from the body without organs. That’s what’s unbearable for Artaud. Artaud’s writing is one of the greatest attempts to channel flows under codes, or through the cracks, whatever those might be—his is the greatest attempt to decode writing. What he calls cruelty is a process of decoding, and when he writes, “all writing is rubbish,” what he means is that all codes, all combinatorics inevitably transform a body into an organism, and that’s God’s doing.</p><p>As for your other question: We do need to demonstrate how the body without organs, an unproductive entity, is produced where it is, in its place, within desiring production. I agree, but that’s what I did last year. We get our cue from the fact that a similar phenomenon takes place in a social body, namely, what always forms in a social body, based on productive forces, there emerges, or is produced, a sort of full social body, which is unproductive on its own [but] takes credit for productive forces.</p><p>The problem isn’t fundamentally different with schizophrenia, where it’s necessary to show how, based on desiring production, which is connected in every way, an unproductive entity, the body without organs, is produced in the midst of such production. Coming at the problem the way you’ve presented it: the body without organs must itself be produced in the interplay between productive partial objects/organs; we need to explain how.</p><p><strong>Georges Comtesse</strong>: You say that the life of the unconscious is that of desiring machines, and if it’s desiring machines, it’s precisely the “<em>objet petit a</em>.” Desiring machines have nothing to do with life—they are mortifying machines, fundamentally mortifying.</p><p><strong>Deleuze</strong>: Why?</p><p><strong>Comtesse</strong>: Because they’re the <em>objet a</em>. If we identify them as the <em>objet a,</em> they can’t be anything other than mortifying machines, and from there, we can understand how the very operation of these mortifying machines could at some point produce a full body.</p><p><strong>Deleuze</strong>: That’s terrible! When I said that desiring machines were the <em>objet a</em>, all I meant was that, even in Lacan, a structure can only function if he sneaks in a machinic element, and the <em>objet a</em> is ultimately a machinic element, and not a structural one. Since last year, I’ve tried to argue that Oedipus is absolutely meaningless when it comes to the unconscious. Lacan is the first to say as much, but tragically, he didn’t want to say the same for castration. And I’m claiming the same thing regarding castration. Moreover, castration only ever served as a foundation for Oedipus. Last year, I was told that Oedipus was a sort of disastrous, unfortunate code explaining the great misery of psychoanalysis. For castration, it was more difficult.</p><p><strong>Comtesse</strong>: You don’t say what castration is. When someone doesn’t say what castration is, I don’t see how, on that basis, one could wind it back.</p><p><strong>Deleuze</strong>: But then, suppose we’re only focusing on what I’ve said about Oedipus, I’m struck by this: if you more or less agree with me on Oedipus and castration, there are some who said: yeah, sure, but watch out for what’s around the bend. There’s the death drive, and don’t think you’re going to get rid of that one. As I see it, Oedipus, castration, and the death drive are three forms of sheer mystification, and we haven’t gotten anywhere if we reintroduce the death drive. Hence why hearing you describe desiring machines as mortifying fills me with dread—because we’ll end up with Oedipus again.</p><p><strong>Comtesse</strong>: There’s not a death cult. It exists, but for psychoanalysts wanting to work, the breakthrough of psychoanalysis is being able to say what about the processes of castration affecting…</p><p><strong>Deleuze</strong>: You’re on the same page, since our problem is this—what psychoanalysis puts the unconscious through: are they [really] processes of the unconscious, or are they artificial processes relayed via one’s social field?</p><p><strong>Comtesse</strong>: There were only positive desiring machines; I don’t see how that could produce a full body.</p><p><strong>Deleuze:</strong> Now, you’re saying: you’ll never get be able to generate the body without organs without introducing mortifying elements. I hope that’s not the case. If the body without organs is a mortifying lump, everything I’m trying to do falls apart.</p><p>Subjects come in to be analyzed, with a particular request, Oedipus and castration. They bring it with them; it’s not that the analyst introduces it. The question is whether these effects—given the transformations in the work of the unconscious—amount to formations of the unconscious or to completely different kinds of mechanisms, mechanisms whose goal and function is to prevent the formations of the unconscious from functioning? My claim is that psychoanalysts don’t invent Oedipus and castration, but the entire analytic procedure consists in short-circuiting the problem: is what the subject brings with them equivalent to their unconscious formations? Obviously, it’s sufficient for the analyst—Oedipus and castration are expressions, expressive components of one’s unconscious formations. So, it’s not that they’ve invented Oedipus, but in a way, it’s worse: [the analyst] confirms [Oedipus and castration] by analytically enshrining them.</p><p>A guy brings in Oedipus, and the analyst turns it into an Oedipus of transference, i.e., an Oedipus of Oedipus. A guy brings his castration, and the analyst turns it into a castration of castration. It’s just like with abortions: you have an abortion twice—once with the knitting mother and again with a specialist in an asepticized clinic.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-06-10/#_edn12 rel=noopener>12</a> The guy’s been castrated once by family and society. He lies on the couch and is castrated again, brilliantly described as a “successful castration.” We’ll succeed where the knitting mother failed. The opposition doesn’t at all seem to be between analysts working in the clinic and philosophers working outside of the clinic. I think my main through-line has been: look at how the unconscious functions, and [you’ll see that] the unconscious doesn’t know anything about Oedipus, castration. All that’s what consciousness projects onto the unconscious. I draw the line where analysts are wedded to the material their subjects bring to them, reckoning that, considering the work of the unconscious, [such material] represents the formations of the unconscious itself… [<em>End of session</em>]</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p><a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-06-10/#_ednref1 rel=noopener>1</a> Deleuze and Guattari introduce the term, “objectities,” in <em>Anti-Oedipus</em>, p. 301.</p><p><a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-06-10/#_ednref2 rel=noopener>2</a> See <em>Anti-Oedipus</em>, pp. 270-271.

These flows have no quality outside their relations and are constantly expanding and escaping their limits. Capitalism counteracts this tendency by imposing an axiomatic that substitutes internal limits for the external limit of the flows, reproducing them on a larger scale and warding off the threat of schizophrenia as the ultimate form of decoding and deterritorialization</li><li><strong>The critique of psychoanalysis and Oedipus</strong>: The lecture criticizes psychoanalysis for its role in supporting the capitalist axiomatic and its concepts of Oedipus, castration, and the death drive. It argues that psychoanalysis imposes Oedipus as a universal and abstract model of desire, ignoring the social and historical conditions that produce it. It also suggests that psychoanalysis reduces desire to lack or prohibition, linking it to the death drive and negating its productive and revolutionary potential.</li><li><strong>The examples from art, literature, and music</strong>: The lecture discusses how some forms of art, literature, and music express or resist the capitalist axiomatic and its Oedipalization of desire. It analyzes the works of D.H. Lawrence, Raymond Roussel, Marcel Proust, Wilhelm Reich, John Cage, and Stockhausen, among others. It shows how some of these works reveal the process of decoding and deterritorialization of flows, while others compensate for it by imposing a combinatorial or axiomatic system of formal elements. It also shows how some of these works challenge or reproduce the phallus-Oedipus-anus trilogy that defines the psychoanalytic conception of desire.</li></ul><blockquote><p>I would like to come back to the structure and the state of flows in the capitalist state. Our problem is always how the flows flow over the full body of this society; how flows flow over the body without organs of money since money capital is, literally, the socius of capitalist society. I would like to try to show that capitalist society, in its very economy, forms a system of immanence: capitalist immanence has three aspects that must be defined at the economic level. It is a matter for us of knowing how the libido in a social field invests flow. And if it is true that libidinal investment is an investment of flows, the status of flows in a social formation will have to inform us about the nature of social investments, collective investments, unconscious investments in the social field itself.</p></blockquote><p><em>Beginning in progress, the session continues Deleuze’s reflections on socio-economic theories under capitalism and their relationship to schizophrenia and psychoanalysis, with the session’s main topic being the structure and status of flows in the capitalist State. Deleuze addresses how flows traverse the monetary body without organs by considering the “system of immanence” of capitalist society, specifically how the libido invests flows in a social field, linked to the collective and unconscious investments in this very social field. The first aspect addressed is the system of differential relations between decoded flows (the axiomatic’s very definition), on the levels of industrial capital, financial capital, and merchant capital. Raising a second aspect, Deleuze emphasizes the infinite nature of accumulation, labor’s flow ceaselessly deterritorialized, capital’s flows ceaselessly decoded, capitalism gleefully extending its machine to its limit only in the schizo flow, schizophrenia as the limit of capitalism’s decoding and deterritorializing. This process corresponds to how Deleuze understands the axiomatic’s mode of functioning and argues that all axiomatics are the means of drawing science into the capitalist market as abstract, decoded Oedipuses. Deleuze locates such abstract Oedipal expressions in art and music, providing a detailed analysis of Lawrence’s <em>Lady Chatterley’s Lover</em>, concluding that in art, Oedipus can cause awful expressions of the great phallus-Oedipus-anus trilogy. Deleuze returns to distinctions between codes and flows: whereas the codes in the primitive machine can only be composed in their indirect relations as finite blocs, not the same as flows, the axiomatic reveals no quality of flows outside their relations, with capitalism inventing the infinite on the economic level, and the axiomatic being a finite operation working on infinite matter. Whereas psychoanalysis initially applies the social axiomatic, at once capitalism’s social coordinates regarding subjectivity, Deleuze suggests that psychoanalysis sought to impose its own axiomatic, or finite principles, hence a structural Oedipus, again, the axiomatic initiating formal relations between fluid quantities. He concludes in response to a student question about the body without organs under capitalism which encompasses money as a tool and thereby causes something to be produced, to flow.</em></p><p><strong>Code Surplus value – The Wasp and the Orchid – Oedipus, Musical Axiomatics (Stockhausen), Finite Blocks, Axiomatics – Aspects of Capitalist Immanence</strong></p><p>… A perfectly good argument levied against anti-psychiatry: yeah, anti-psychiatrists are people who say, “Hurray for schizophrenia”—and they ascribe to [R.D.] Laing the idea that anti-psychiatry boils down to arguing that schizophrenia is what’s actually healthy. It’s such a misrepresentation.</p><p>I’d like for us to recall Laing’s basic idea, which isn’t at all what this article’s author claims it to be. Laing’s position is that schizophrenia ought to be understood as part of a process, and the question he asks is: how are schizophrenic patients produced? And he explores that question in the following way: do they come about following a schizophrenic process, or is it the opposite, i.e., are they the result of that process being interrupted, from its protracted absence, from its aggravation? And far from ignoring the fact that schizophrenic patients are suffering and unwell, he thinks they’re all the more so, since their being made into schizophrenics is linked, not to what we might call the schizophrenic process, but to what we should recognize as the interruption of such a process. It’s so dishonest to attribute to Laing and other anti-psychiatrists the idea that schizophrenia, as a diagnosis, is something to be admired.</p><p>Because there’s something else going on that gets overlooked: this same author explains how the main thing troubling psychiatrists is their fraught relationship with their patients. Not a word about what really stresses out young psychiatrists, namely, how from the very beginning, psychiatrists have not only had to help people re-adjust, but have had to act as quasi-police, policing patients in troubling ways. What’s the point of involuntary admissions, which aren’t about figuring out madness, but figuring out who to send to a psychiatric hospital—to what extent administration and psychiatry work together when it comes to involuntary admissions—what about medical-legal files that come down hard on any children who are the least bit disturbed, even those who are emotionally unstable and who actually have a psychiatric record? This <em>Nouvel Observateur</em> article doesn’t mention it at all. You might remember how a prisoner named Buffet took two hostages at Clairvaux Prison and ended up killing them. Shortly after, the Minister of the Interior made a statement to prefects, something like: You should be on high alert regarding open hospitals, after seeing what happened at Clairvaux. The current campaign is moving toward a more rigid structure for internment.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-07-9/#_edn1 rel=noopener>1</a></p><p>I’d like us to go back to the state of flows and how they’re structured in the capitalist state. Our problem is always how flows run along the surface of the full body of such a society, how flows run along the body without organs of money, since money-capital is, strictly speaking, the socius of capitalist society. I’d like to try to demonstrate that capitalist society, in the very form of its economics, forms a system of immanences. Capitalist immanence has three aspects, which we should describe economically. For us, the point is to figure out how the libido invests flows in a social field. But if it’s true that libidinal investment is an investment of flows, the state of flows in a social formation ought to clue us in on the nature of the social investments, the collective investments, the unconscious investments within the social field itself.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-07-9/#_edn2 rel=noopener>2</a></p><p>The first aspect of capitalist immanence has to do with a system of differential relationships between decoded flows (the first definition of axiomatics). These relationships have shown up at varying levels. They’ve shown up first at the level of industrial capital: a differential relationship between two flows with different capacities [<em>de puissance différente</em>], between incommensurable flows, the flow of capital and the flow of labor. These flows are incommensurable in that they have different capacities, and at the same time, they’d still only be virtual, mutually independent, i.e., independent of their reciprocal determination. And then, at the same time, in terms of financial capital, we saw a differential relationship between the flow of finance and the flow of revenue or payment. It’s not about there being two forms of money, it’s that money contains both of these forms, they’re two sides of the same coin. On one side, as money-capital, there’s a financial flow, and on the other side, there’s a flow of revenue or wages. Then we saw a third sort of differential relationship at the level of market capital, namely the differential relationship between what could be called the market flow and the flow of knowledge, or innovation.</p><p>I always come back to Marx has famously written on the “tendency of the rate of profit to fall.”
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-07-9/#_edn3 rel=noopener>3</a> The gist of these passages is that, in capitalism, obviously there have been developments with machines and even automation. As automation improves, human labor becomes more and more closely bound to the machine. How then can we maintain that capitalism is based on human surplus value, with human surplus value being exported according to the flow of human labor, when it comes to the development of machines in at least some parts of capitalism, where human labor is increasingly tied to machines, and where are machines more and more productive? It seems that human surplus value is steadily declining in capitalism. [Maurice] Clavel, who isn’t an economist and doesn’t pretend to be an economist, asks Marxist economists to explain how they can maintain both that capitalism depends on human surplus value and that, at the same time, machines appear to be getting more and more productive, and human labor more and more tied to them.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-07-9/#_edn4 rel=noopener>4</a></p><p>Now, Marx says: yes, there is a tendency for relative surplus value to fall, but there are multiple independent factors counteracting this tendency. We only find one of these factors in our third differential relationship: when it comes to the parts of capitalism that get automated, what happens? First off, when does capitalism invest in so-called innovation (innovating machines and automation)? We all know that it doesn’t make such an investment to keep up with science and technology; it’s based on profitability of project in question, the venture’s profitability defined in terms relative to other ventures in the broader market. Which implies that areas with high levels of innovation—see the book, <em>Monopoly Capital</em>, from Maspero
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-07-9/#_edn5 rel=noopener>**_[5]_**</a>—implies that, by contrast, there are areas where old and outdated equipment is maintained, and where machines are only invested in when it’s possible to lower the cost of production, which involves how the innovating business relates to businesses that have to keep their equipment in another area, and to the general market.</p><p>This third differential relationship is, as neo-economists say—the knowledge flow or the innovation flow in capitalist regimes—it’s proprietary, it’s paid, paid on the basis of an innovation flow and a knowledge flow, which is financially just like the revenue flow, the payment flow we discussed earlier in the context of finance capital. On the other hand, the market flow, where innovation is inscribed and which determines the latter’s profitability, has a completely different character and an incommensurable capacity [<em>puissance</em>]—the case of a typically capitalist differential, a differential relationship between quantities that don’t have the same capacity, by all appearances. For example: the form of money used to pay for innovation isn’t the same as that used to ascertain the profitability of said innovation. Thus, we end up with three fundamental differential relationships corresponding to three fundamental forms of capital.</p><p>This system of differential relationships represents a fundamental shift in the capitalist machine compared to non-capitalist societies; generally speaking, the phenomenon of surplus value does not begin with capitalism. Surplus value is actually a component in all social formations. What we should say, however, is that, for non-capitalist social arrangements, surplus value is a surplus value of code. For example, there is a feudal surplus value, a despotic surplus value, because you get surplus value whenever there is surplus labor. Now, non-capitalist societies already have surplus labor, already have surplus value—only it’s a surplus value of code. A surplus value of code; how might that work? It’s almost as though there were a chain, a signifying chain, and then all of a sudden it intercepts a fragment of another chain. Bizarre, this phenomenon of interception. What I’m saying is that there are chains everywhere you look; there isn’t one single chain. A major signifier is like a strip, where there are a ton of things going by, then one fragment intercepts another.</p><p>There’s an orchid, for example, and this orchid’s flower bears an incredible likeness of a wasp.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-07-9/#_edn6 rel=noopener>6</a> What’s more, it [the flower] forms both bodies, bizarrely. The orchid’s phylogenetic chain snatches up a fragment of a completely different chain: a wasp—there’s a biologist who works on this, which he calls “aparallel evolution”—the signifying chain of the wasp, where the wasp’s code and the orchid’s code suddenly collide.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-07-9/#_edn7 rel=noopener>7</a> The orchid forms the pattern of a female wasp, to the point where the male wasp is fooled and lands on the orchid, believing he’s found a female wasp. It’s a well-known short-circuit, an interception between two chains.</p><p>I’d argue that in this area, there’s a surplus value of code; it’s like an animated code. A sort of bio-code pounces onto a fragment of a completely different code and appropriates it. Here, the orchid starts to depict female wasps. I’m simply assuming that that’s how surplus value works in non-capitalist societies: at the level of code, there are jumps, what [Marcel] Griaule also calls the fructification of wealth, that show up as interceptions between chains of instances of surplus value. Such surplus value is a surplus value of code.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-07-9/#_edn8 rel=noopener>8</a></p><p>With capitalism, what’s the major shift? With capitalism, there’s no longer a surplus value of code. How does it work under capitalism, looking specifically at code? There’s this sort of conversion of surplus value: surplus value ceases to be that of code and becomes a surplus value of flow. One of the outcomes of capitalism isn’t the existence of surplus value—since, again, it existed before—but the transformation of code surplus value into flow surplus value. And the surplus value of flow results from the differential relationship between the different types of flow that we were just discussing. I’d also say that the differential relationship between the flow of capital and the flow of labor generates what we ought to call human surplus value, since it’s produced from human labor. The differential relationship between finance/revenue flows generates what we might call financial surplus value. And lastly, the third market/innovation relationship generates a specifically machinic surplus value. Those are the three forms of flow surplus value in capitalist systems.</p><p>As for how the most sterile, the sterile body, the unproductive body of money, can manage to produce something—in other words, if money is <em>x</em>, how can this <em>x</em> be added to a “<em>+ Dx”</em> which stands for the fluctuation and fructification of money? The answer comes to us in the following way: behind the fluctuation itself is the differential relationship between flows. In other words, if we write capital/surplus value as <em>x + Dx</em>, where does <em>Dx</em> come from? It always comes from these <em>Dy / Dx</em> sort of differential relationships, such as the three we just saw with human surplus value, financial surplus value, and machinic surplus value.</p><p>I’d like to return to the idea that none of these flows can be defined independently, since their differential relationship is one of reciprocal determination. There’s no flow of capital if wealth is not convertible into means of production. It can be converted into means of production only when the capitalist encounters the worker who possesses nothing but his/her labor force. In other words, capital as industrial capital remains purely virtual if the capitalist cannot find anyone selling their labor on the market. And conversely, the worker is only virtually a worker if they do not find the capitalist to buy their labor force. In other words, both of these flows—the flow of labor and the flow of capital—are incommensurable and caught up in a reciprocally determining relationship, to the point that one cannot be determined outside its differential relationship with the other.</p><p>It’s not at all a two-part sequence where, on the one hand, capitalism decodes and deterritorializes flows and then introduces an axiomatic to salvage it. Strictly speaking, it’s in one fell swoop, and that’s why, from the very outset, state capitalism—as historians well know, there’s never been the slightest contradiction between private capitalism and state capitalism. In the very same move, capitalism substitutes an axiomatic for ruined code. That way, the differential relationships already fill in some of the immanence of the capitalist machine, this immanence being like the hollow of money-capital. That’s clear enough.</p><p>This second aspect amounts to saying that, not only does it work, and not only does it presuppose decoded and deterritorialized flows, but it decodes more and more, deterritorializes further and further. Capitalism only appears to reintroduce code. There’s an axiomatic of money; at any given moment, everything in the machine is simultaneous. It decodes, it deterritorializes at every turn: the deterritorialization of the worker and their decoding is never done. We shouldn’t interpret primitive accumulation as something that only happened early on—primitive accumulation doesn’t stop! The flow of workers doesn’t stop getting deterritorialized; the flow of capital doesn’t stop getting decoded. It’s always too coded for capitalism’s needs, even though, in another sense, it hasn’t been coded from the very beginning.</p><p>At the same time, it must be said: mutant capital, short-term capital, this sort of capital migration, all this about decoding and deterritorialization—it shouldn’t be taken as metaphorical. These are physical processes, economic-physical processes. For all other societies, there was only the fear that flows would decode and deterritorialize, and the prayer in these societies was: God, spare us from the flood! God, don’t let anything spill over. And all desire was involved; all of society’s libidinal investments were involved—keep this horrible thing from happening, this unspeakable thing, i.e., flows running with no code, flowing with no lands [<em>terres</em>].</p><p>Yet, on the other hand, here capitalism is, fat and happy; it’s a really devious turn of events. There’s this wicked illustration by some Englishman: people are crying in a movie theater—we don’t know why; we can’t see the screen. And there’s a little old man tucked away in the corner alone, who looks ridiculously spiteful, with beady little eyes, and he’s busting a gut. It must be a vampire movie. Everyone’s crying, but he’s laughing. Well, that’s capitalism. In what way does the machine work even harder with capitalism? This is the second aspect of capitalist immanence: looking at the capitalist flow itself, without qualifying it any further, an unnamable thing flowing over the body of money-capital—it’s the flow of the unnamable, the unnamable out on a stroll. It’s the flow whose limit is the schizo flow. In this sense, schizophrenia is the external limit of all decoding and all deterritorialization… [<em>Interruption</em>]</p><p>… Schizophrenia as the limit for the processes of decoding and deterritorialization. In that sense, capitalism does have an external limit, and saying that its external limit is schizophrenia is just another way of saying that it functions on the basis of decoded and deterritorialized flows. Hence capitalist economic processes and schizophrenic circuits are tightly intertwined. They don’t cross wires because they describe different domains. But were we to make a sort of topography of so-called short term migrant capital, it would be constantly moving, deterritorializing. And were we to map the migrations of Beckett’s characters, the great Schizo stroll, from an economic perspective, it wouldn’t be any different. It all falls under the heading of deterritorialization and decoding, where schizophrenia is indeed the external limit. But it’s true of the flows coursing over the surface of capital in and of themselves—it’s their external limit.</p><p>And at the same time, we’ve seen that capitalism constantly counteracts its tendency, i.e., it fends off its limit. It’s what I had proposed as an equivalent for the Marxist principle of declining surplus value: [capitalism] tends towards a limit that it perpetually resists; it constantly counteracts its tendency. The making of Schizos is fundamentally capitalist production. From the point of view of our differential relationships, it’s an unconsumable product. It keeps driving away its own limit, to the point that we could say it has no external limit, that it only has internal limits, those of capital itself, internal limits that are constantly reproduced on a larger and larger scale. That’s what I was getting at last week regarding Bernard Schmitt and his theory of financial capitalism.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-07-9/#_edn9 rel=noopener>9</a> He highlighted how the reproduction of capitalism by no means occurs in the form of extensive reproduction; it happens sporadically through destruction-creation, according to the notorious capitalist understanding of money-economies—creating money, destroying money, creating money—and that at each sphere of destruction-creation, there’s a sort of widening of limits. The way it happens isn’t contained at all; like everything that happens on a full body’s surface, it takes place in intensity.</p><p>In that regard, flows do have an external limit in capitalism: schizophrenia, the schizo flow, the schiz-flow. But just as they’re caught up in differential relationships that make up an axiomatic, their external limit is constantly warded off. Strictly speaking, this machine has no external limit. From the perspective of its flows, there are, [but] there not from the point of view of the differential relationships between flows. On the other hand, the differential relationships between flows always have internal limits set by the state of capital and the differential relationships between the three differential relationships themselves, i.e., the second-degree differential relationships between industrial capital, finance capital, and market capital. There are thus internal limits that constantly get reproduced on a larger and larger scale. This is the second aspect of capitalist immanence as an economic system: the reproduction of internal limits on an ever-wider scale, this way of countering the external limit of decoded flows by substituting prior limits that refer to the differential relationships between decoded flows and that are constantly reproduced on a wider scale.</p><p>How does an axiomatic work, in the most concrete terms possible? Even if we approach the word through its mathematical roots—I don’t believe that’s where we’ll get its true meaning—there’s a social aspect to it; true axiomatics is social and not scientific. Scientific axiomatics is only one method whereby flows of science, flows of knowledge, are stored and maintained in the capitalist machine. It’s no good to assume that the notion of axiomatics is consistent. Scientists do, because axiomatics allow them to ensure a kind of consistency. In fact, it’s a thoroughly inconsistent notion; it’s a mess, from top to bottom. An axiomatic consists of a process. But it’s never fully exhausted by this process. What’s more, this process is always anti-axiomatic, i.e., it’s something that flows, and in flowing, increasingly verges toward its limit, toward a schizz. And the role of axiomatics is to counteract, to compensate for its limit, to bring it all back as best it can, not a code, but to substitute internal limits corresponding to the differential relationships between decoded flows, to substitute that for the very process of decoding flows in and of themselves.</p><p>Axiomatics follows the process of decoding and substitutes a combinatorial system for faulty codes, i.e., what it loses at one end it makes up for at the other. Every axiomatic is a way of tying science back to the capitalist market. All axiomatics are abstract forms of Oedipus; they’re processes of abstract oedipalization, oedipalization without mommy and daddy. It consists in axiomatizing decoded Oedipus [<em>missing text</em>]… The ever-widening scale is—we add an axiom, we rework the axiomatic, something leaks [<em>fuit</em>] out the side. The axiomatic no longer holds—you rework the axiomatic, you re-axiomatize.</p><p>I’d like to offer an example from art and music. There’s a certain trend in contemporary music towards combinatorial or axiomatic music. One of the most brilliant representatives—you’ll understand where Oedipus fits in: there’s a figurative Oedipus, the little daddy-mommy-me triangle, and we have to ask ourselves what it has to do with capitalism. It’s not enough to point to bourgeois families; we need to show how Oedipus, defined by the daddy-mommy-me triangle, is necessarily bound up with capitalist economic axiomatics. When the figurative Oedipus doesn’t work, there are all kinds of Oedipus we don’t recognize because they aren’t figurative—abstract versions of Oedipus. Hence, we can talk about Oedipal music or Oedipal painting. An Oedipal form of music might be great, but it’s still Oedipal. How so? Through its opposition to Schizo music.</p><p>In <em>Lady Chatterley’s Lover</em>, you have the gamekeeper, and Lady Chatterley is carrying his child. Because she needs a legitimate father—and it can’t be the gamekeeper—she approaches one of her painter friends, who says, “I’ll do it on one condition, that you pose as a model for me.”
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-07-9/#_edn10 rel=noopener>10</a> And Lady Chatterley is annoyed, not at the idea of posing as a model, but because she isn’t sure what he’s up to. And then there’s this dreadful exchange between the gamekeeper and the painter, and the painter is pretty hostile, totally deranged. He bristles at the gamekeeper and despises him, and the gamekeeper sends it right back. Looking at his paintings, the gamekeeper says, “”It murders all the bowels of compassion in a man.” And the painter responds—as twisted and hateful as he can—“Perhaps stupidity is murdered; sentimental stupidity.” The game keeper looks and says, “No, I think all these tubes and corrugated vibrations”—going right for the jugular—“are stupid enough for anything, and pretty sentimental.”
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-07-9/#_edn11 rel=noopener>11</a></p><p>I like this passage because it shows us how both versions of Oedipus can coexist. The gamekeeper is right. No one has gone as far as [D.H.] Lawrence in sort of de-oedipalizing sexuality, nature. The more Oedipus is concealed or abstracted, the harder it will be to scrape it out [curettage]. You can take the curette to the figurative Oedipus, but the most pitiful and brilliant things can survive in the secret corners where Oedipus finds shelter, in art. You have to think like that gamekeeper: in all modern art, there are some truly ugly, dirty things. If necessary, what started out glorious has become mortifying, has become anal. Now, Oedipus is anal. Anality is foundational for Oedipus, since, as everyone knows, Oedipus is founded on castration. But what’s behind the castration? It’s obviously not the phallus; it’s the anus. The anus is the very act of castration, and the phallus wouldn’t exist without the anus. In other words, this whole aspect of Oedipus is defined by this infamous trinity (phallus – Oedipus – anus). But I think it started off gloriously and then began to go foul.</p><p>Take an international example: something that started out as a sort of song of life, something that was revolutionary—because I can’t think of anything revolutionary that isn’t a song of life. When that turns into a filthy culture of death. At first, pop art was incredible, not the least bit surrealist, in both music, like John Cage, and in painting; there was a great outpouring of life. And then before long, by the time you get to the tail-end of pop art, it turns to death, and not just because they were merely copying what had already been done. It goes much deeper than that. All of a sudden, its flow becomes disgusting: tortured bodies, machines, tubes—something like a non-figurative axiomatic.</p><p>When it comes to schizo-analysis, you have to look for both versions of Oedipus. Before he died, Stravinsky said, “Everything I’ve done has been because my mother didn’t love me and my father was never there.”
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-07-9/#_edn12 rel=noopener>12</a> That’s his big, figurative Oedipus; that’s the musician’s Oedipus. But on another level, there might be an Oedipal painting, and that’s more or less what we find in Lawrence: these tubes and corrugations, this abstract painting which has become something dead, or pop art which has turned into a sort of death scare.</p><p>What are we to make of this axiomatic, which is no more than abstract Oedipus, informal Oedipus? So much so that when Oedipus has been run out of his little nook in the family, he necessarily shows back up in forms that have to be confronted all over again, combinatorial forms, axiomatic forms. Again, it’s for this reason that we’re taught we shouldn’t confuse psychoanalytic Oedipus and familial Oedipus—because the psychoanalytic Oedipus is an abstract Oedipus, one that tends towards non-figurative versions.</p><p>When a musician as brilliant as Stockhausen tries to explain what’s specified by a combinatory system, in what it does musically, I find his choice of words rather instructive: “My work constructs a multiplicity.” That’s very close to the very movement of the process of flows. What really makes up a multiplicity are flows that are decoded and deterritorialized. Stockhausen uses a term from physics and mathematics—where the term, “multiplicity,” was a noun referring to something that completely side-steps the choice between the one and the many. Multiplicity as a noun, the noun-form of multiplicity—that really dissolves everything about the one as well as the many, because “multiple” could no longer work as an adjective.</p><p>An ever-growing multiplicity of musical interpretation perhaps becomes possible through series of 17 periods.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-07-9/#_edn13 rel=noopener>13</a> So, his work will have 17 periods, and from one periodicity to the next, the multiplicity grows—what I had described as creeping or leaking [<em>fuir</em>] from one end. A sound flow slips under—under what? We know the extent to which Stockhausen participated in the whole movement of decoding that characterizes contemporary music; decoding, not in the sense of deciphering a code, but in the sense of destroying musical codes. He tells us: the idea of an ever-growing multiplicity means that it slips out from under anything you might reintroduce as code.</p><p>The result is a free dynamic process, dynamic because the multiplicity is constantly growing; that’s what I was getting at when I was describing a decoded flow tending towards its external limit. Multiplicity is process, not combinatory—since multiplicities are always growing and free, since they don’t reach limits and have no end in sight—indeed, its movement, its process tends towards its external limit, which is always beyond it, pushed further away as the decoded flow spills over. But we shouldn’t take that too far. What he was saying is: I’m going to unleash a dynamic process of growing multiplicities which is continually decoded, and which continually tends towards its limit. I argue that at this point, it’s not about combination or axiomatics; we’re dealing with process, but at the same time, any increase in multiplicity has to be compensated for by reducing and converging the formal elements to be interpreted and by a limitation concerning laws of combination. Great: in the first sentence, he was talking about process; in the second, he’s putting it in terms of combination and axiomatics.</p><p>What I’d like for you to appreciate is that, from our current perspective, this way of describing Stockhausen’s music is absolutely no different from what we were saying earlier about the purest form of monetary political economy. Swap out the properties of the flows, and it’s exactly the same thing. I’m well aware of what a genius Stockhausen is, but being brilliant doesn’t stop you from making all sorts of compromises, or from producing what appears to be the most axiomatized or combinatorial work possible, while at the same time involving all sorts of pieces and fragments. Its combinatorial, axiomatic aspect is absolutely non-consistent; that doesn’t stop it from working, from having a really peculiar function. In one sentence, he says: I’m going to put you through a dynamic process of growing multiplicities and decoding flows. But hang on, let’s not get ahead of ourselves; the flow process itself—the growth of flows, the fluctuation of what’s flowing—the flow flows via the multiplicity’s expansion. That has to be compensated for. “Should be compensated for”—there’s a legitimate and an illegitimate way of understanding “should.” Either he says it “should” because I, Stockhausen, want it to be that way, or he’s describing the nature of how multiplicities expand, that the increase in its multiplicity be compensated for. Why, then? Sure, for Stockhausen since that’s what he’s doing. But does it inherently have to be so? Is it part of the music? It’s what makes Stockhausen original, but one could very well imagine investigating the sonic process of expanding multiplicity, where the increase in multiplicities doesn’t have to be compensated for. Why “should” it be? It’s possible, but it doesn’t have to be.</p><p>What does he mean by “compensate”? The flowing process with growing multiplicities is a process affecting time and space. It’s a process whose basis is Space-Time, or duration, even. In such a spatio-temporal process with growing multiplicities, there’s a whole outpouring of flows, and what’s more, the flow increasingly has a ton of fluctuation. When he says that it should be compensated for, he’s telling us that the mounting freedom in its spatio-temporal multiplicity has to be compensated for by restricting the combination of its formal elements: timbres, pitches. His thing has 17 periods—from one period to the next, the multiplicity expands, as he puts it, with “gradual indeterminacy in attack intervals and their sequence.” So, from one period to the next, this indeterminism, this musical indeterminism, which is tied to the multiplicity’s growth across periods, is shaped and defined as a continuously expanding spatio-temporal multiplicity. That’s what I’d call a more and more extended decoding and deterritorialization of flows.</p><p>But at the same time, there’s something else covering that up: namely, the closer you get to the 17th period—where the growing multiplicity is closest to its limit—as you move toward the 17th period, the more this growing multiplicity and the freedom of its flow gets compensated for by a combinatorics of its formal elements—to the point where, Stockhausen says in the rest of the text, the 17th period—where the multiplicity has expanded the most—should also be the one closest to the first period, where the multiplicity was equivocal. There’s no better way of describing how combinatorics replaces the process and its external limit with a set of formal internal relations.</p><p>When it comes to musical combinatorics, you could reach the same conclusions we did in our examination of an economic axiomatics of money. The first dimension has to do with the fluctuation and fluxion of flows moving toward an external limit and constantly coming up to this limit which then tend to put something over the limit. Such art forms that have nothing to do with the schizophrenic as a clinical phenomenon. I ought to call them schizophrenic Art forms. The schizoid Arts, whatever form they might take, are about taking deterritorialization, decoding, all the way, causing flows of expanding multiplicity—our task will be to circle back later to this notion of increasing multiplicity—and then on that note, there’s a quite different law that presupposes decoding and deterritorialization, one that backpedals. Namely: the external limit, as the threshold of absolute decoding, as the breaking through the wall and the wall’s wall—thus, as the reality of the Schizo Arts—ends up getting replaced by something else.</p><p>The growth process of flows will get axiomatized, will get taken up in a combinatory system. At that point, rather than an external relationship limiting decoded flows, there’ll be internal relationships limiting the differential relationships between decoded flows, i.e., what [Stockhausen] is calling the relationship between formal elements. It’s the same operation as that of capitalism: it’s a matter of warding off the external limit. It’s about preventing flows from fluctuating in free multiplicities. So, instead of an external limit, an outside threshold as the limit of decoded flows, we instead find a system of internal relationships reproducing on a wider scale. […] [<em>Interruption</em>]</p><p>… One side of axiomatics—but it’s only an aspect of axiomatics inasmuch as they’re failing, vanishing codes—at the other end, there’s the process of decoding, the deterritorializing process of expanding multiplicities, with its external threshold, its external limit. Axiomatics swings from one end to the other: it takes the process a step further, but then it hast to tie it off, prevent it from leaking out [<em>fuir</em>]. It recaptures it by combining formal elements; in place of the process tending toward its external limit, it substitutes an internal limit system, corresponding to its formal relationship. That’s precisely how axiomatics operates.</p><p>There’s no reason to talk about political economy any differently than we do music, if we’re framing things in terms of flow, since the problem is this—don’t all axiomatics, whatever they may be, form abstract Oedipuses, these figurative Oedipuses that constitute bringing back [<em>possible missing words</em>]?</p><p>As for the second aspect of capitalist immanence, it seems to me that it—if the first was a system of differential relationships between decoded flows—the second aspect is that, instead of the external limit of decoded flows, it substitutes a system or aggregate [<em>ensemble</em>] of internal limits that correspond to its differential relationships, a system of reproducible internal limits that can be replicated on an ever-wider scale.</p><p>An axiomatics that carries and operates on decoded flows—it compensates for the flows’ free expansion by restricting the system of formal relationships defining the system’s internal limits, even if that means reproducing these limits on a larger and larger scale.</p><p>Geometry has long been linked to signs we might think of as territorial, which are themselves linked to a set of codes. There are codes—right up to the end of feudalism—so long as there is no capitalist machine. Cartesian geometry: looking at it one way, doesn’t it ruin a whole array [<em>tout un ensemble</em>] of prior geometric codes? But from another angle, isn’t it still a code, with a whole coordinate system, a whole system of territorialization? For territorialization isn’t just about land [<em>terre</em>]; it’s whenever signs are reflected onto whatever serves as territoriality for said signs.</p><p>The Cartesian coordinate system strikes me as an attempt to reterritorialize mathematical signs which are in the process of being decoded. As far as I can tell, [it comes down to] acknowledging a scientific endeavor that no longer goes through code but in fact goes through an axiomatic. It first happens in mathematics, around the middle of the 19th century, and it takes place in the context of differential calculus, that is, with [Karl] Weierstrass. He proposes a static interpretation of differential calculus, whereby differentiation is no longer understood as a process, and he turns differential relationships into an axiomatic. That only really takes shape under 19th century capitalism.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-07-9/#_edn14 rel=noopener>14</a></p><p><em>Student</em>: You said that in a code, each element is determined in itself, whereas in an axiomatic, flows are determined through their differential relationships. Morse code, for example: <em>dot, dash, dot, dash</em>—each element is determined separately. But when we have a group [<em>ensemble</em>] of elements, they’re differentiated from each other, and we pin a meaning onto them.</p><p><em>Deleuze</em>: I’m not so sure Morse code is a code. Neither is it a purely combinatorial system. It’s a sort of residual combinatorics.</p><p>In the case of code, or a coding of flows, flows get their own qualities based on the code, i.e., they can only be indirectly related to each other. It makes no difference whether the flows are described separately or are necessarily related to each other indirectly, be it code or axiomatic, the [<em>word unclear</em>] only in their relationships with each other. In the case of a code, flows are interrelated, but their qualities are distributive, i.e., they inherently belong to the flow in question—that’s how the flow of the unnamable is avoided. With code, flows each have to be described on their own, and they have to relate to each other indirectly.</p><p>For example: we’re told that in a primitive machine, there are three flows: consumer goods, prestige goods, and authority over human beings. That gives us three loops: these flows are delineated separately. Granted, they don’t exist outside the relationship they have with each other; the nature of their relationship is such that the relationship between flows [<em>unclear</em>]… and that, by virtue of the indirect relationship between flows, that is, under certain conditions, in certain places, under certain circumstances where, e.g., the flow of consumer goods ties back to the flow of prestige goods. Prestige goods will only be exchanged for consumer goods at the territory’s periphery.</p><p>A whole system of indirect relationships between qualified flows; that’s what a code is. From there, it follows that units of code are, by nature, finite blocks, because so far as code is concerned, a unit of code is something that draws in samples [<em>prélèvements</em>] from different flows. Each unit of code will be laden with different samples, and will be able to compound them, in their indirect relationships, in the form of a finite block—you restore the balance between these qualified flows, for example, in the form of consumption. But what goes into consumption loses something; there’s a functional imbalance. It never works in the form of exchange—it’s always imbalanced, and this imbalance is compensated for by the prestige of the one giving to consumption, or by their right to women. It forms a finite block. Finite blocks are units of code, units of code not being the same thing as flows, but are veritable finite cuts, cuts forming finite blocks.</p><p>In an axiomatic, flows have no quality outside of their relationships. The capitalist is not the owner of a flow of capital; he’s only the owner of a flow of virtual capital so long as he hasn’t converted his titles to wealth into means of production, into machines, for example. And he doesn’t convert his titles to wealth until he finds someone whose labor he can buy, and vice versa: flows cannot be characterized apart from their reciprocal determination, which has priority over their characterization. It follows that axiomatics always deals with the infinite; its matter is infinite, whereas there isn’t any code for the infinite. That’s why theologians, despite themselves, are progressive: they get into atheism, and find themselves confronted with the challenge—is this thing codable?</p><p>Here again, ideology is bullshit—we shouldn’t think about theology in the Middle Ages through the lens of ideology; it’s stranger than that: some aspect of social organization starts unfolding right away. Ideology does not exist. In the ideological field, what’s at play is much more immediate. Theologians find themselves faced with something that calls into question the very form of their society: is it possible to code infinity? And the problem of heresy arises in their Trinitarian coding… [<em>Interruption</em>]</p><p>Once we’re dealing with an infinite process, codes break down. Capitalism invents infinite, even economically speaking: at the level of capitalist production, of producing in order to produce. And, as a second infinity, capital in the form of <em>x / Dx</em> <em>ad infinitum</em>. Capitalism is what makes infinite debt possible. With capitalism, production, the social body in the form of money capital, and debt all become infinite processes, and it gets axiomatized. What escapes code, the process as infinite process, will be the sort of material or expanding multiplicity that axiomatics is responding to. As for axiomatics, what it carries back to the finitude of axiomatics is always an infinite material—it’s the finite representation of an infinite process.</p><p>An axiomatic is an act of finitude performed on infinite matter. Weierstrass was the one who took every way of interpreting differential calculus, from Leibniz to [Joseph Louis] Lagrange, and threw it all out the window, claiming it had nothing to do with process. Yes, there is a process as pure matter, but we can’t stop there; it all has to be axiomatized. Which means finding the finite grid to choke out the infinite number of possible combinations. Weierstrass interprets differential and infinitesimal calculus in a way he himself calls “static,” where there’s no longer any flux towards a limit, no longer any concept of threshold, but instead a system of choices, from the perspective of an ordinal interpretation. Differential calculus is completely turned around from the perspective of ordinal numbers, no longer from the perspective of cardinal numbers—thus, a static order with a system of assumptions or choices in an ordinal series, where the concepts of limit, threshold, of movement towards, have lost all meaning. In other words, differential calculus brings with it an infinite matter which relatively decodes mathematics, compared to its previous state. Axiomatics is a finite network applied onto infinite material, since such infinite material had gotten away from codes.</p><p>Theologians have this machine: the Christian flow is one of infinite debt, the flow of its infinite process. It contaminates every code; the Roman code falters beneath it. The challenge is how to save the Roman Empire and Christianity at the same time. Theologians talk about the Trinity, but their discussion isn’t what’s important. What matters is the formal operation they carry out: through their theology, they’re also working out a political economy. Christianity offers us the infinite, which is to say, we’re in a social regime where nothing ends—it’s for life. We need to approach infinity economically. In other words, I’ll take the codes that caused finite blocks to circulate, and I’ll make a finite block of alliance and kinship. The prisoner said to himself, “Well, they’re going to kill me, and then it’s over for me,” in the sense of “this is finite.” That’s what Nietzsche’s talking about in the second essay of <em>The</em> [<em>Genealogy of</em>] <em>Morality</em>: during the prehistoric age, debt is finite.</p><p>It takes an incredible series of events before you get an economy of infinite debt. There’s never been an economy of exchange; exchange is a guise for the circulation of debt when it becomes infinite, but when it’s still debt, it never looks like an exchange. When we’re dealing with the problem of how to stop a process without reintroducing codes, the answer comes in the form of axiomatics, a finite grid, a number of finite principles marshalling a combinatorial system whose figures are infinite. That’s how Oedipus works: the figurative Oedipus, the imaginary Oedipus, has a special territory, one of pure, infinite matter, since, no matter what happens, Oedipus will be there: you love your father, you don’t love him, you’re perverted, neurotic, or psychotic—regardless, it’s Oedipus (infinite process), the figurative form of Oedipus. It’s no secret that Oedipus has an unlimited number of permutations.</p><p>Psychoanalysis is the application of an axiomatic that far exceeds it. In part, it applies the social coordinates of capitalism: it’s essential for capitalism that there be two sorts of individual: social individuals and private individuals. Social individuals—capitalists, bankers, workers—and private persons—family members—do not belong to the same order. Part of capitalism is how one sort of individual gets reflected [<em>rabattre</em>] onto another, and psychoanalysis is an application of capitalist axiomatics. But in its unending ambition, it gets sick of acting as a field of application for a pre-existing Oedipus—it tells us, for example, that the infinite versions of Oedipus are only imaginary. Which means that its Oedipal material is precisely the infinite process as reduced by psychoanalysis, but the problem is how to avoid an infinite process and to find a finite grid.</p><p>Fed up with being the application of capitalist axiomatics, psychoanalysis wanted to become an axiomatics in and of itself, i.e., to find a handful of finite principles the infinite combinations of its infinite material depend on. That’s the structural Oedipus, the psychoanalytic Oedipus. It was axiomatized the moment it said, “But the infinity of Oedipus is imaginary,” and that depends on a handful of principles forming a structure, which are able to generate, produce all the imaginary forms of Oedipus. At that point, axiomatization is exactly what the structural Oedipus does.</p><p><em>Student</em>: Could we say that the way the stock market operates depends on an axiomatic?</p><p><em>Deleuze</em>: Accounting activities, on the one hand, and stock market activities, on the other, might not be axiomatics <em>per se</em>, but they directly depend on economic axiomatics. An axiomatic is not defined by the constancy of certain quantities but by the establishment of formal relationships between flowing quantities.</p><p><em>Student</em>: The body without organs of capital?</p><p><em>Deleuze</em>: The body without organs of capital isn’t the entire capitalist machine. The body without organs of capitalism is an idea that only works at the next level. Money <em>qua</em> money is incapable of producing anything; its role is sterile, unproductive. Therein lies a major paradox: it turns out that this big unproductive, sterile entity does produce—that money makes money. So, something has to be stuck onto money’s BwO, but it doesn’t come down to claiming that capitalism is money-as-BwO. It means that capitalism understands money as BwO and, thanks to a whole series of cogs and wheels, it makes money produce something. Money as BwO indicates a part of the machine. Something has to flow over the BwO, and capitalist desire is aimed at this whatsit flowing over the BwO of money capital. The latter precisely being flows caught in reciprocal determination.</p><p><em>Student</em>: Schizophrenia is when someone lives in a space and time different from ours. Is it possible for the schizophrenic to latch back onto our space-time, and if so, how would we relate capitalism to this modification in the space-time continuum?</p><p><em>Deleuze</em>: I’ll borrow the example of Mrs. [Gisela] Pankow’s psychotherapy—she ends her account by saying, “Thus, I turned this bold schizophrenic into a timid paranoiac.” A recoding of the schizo, then, converting the schizo into a paranoiac. Laing doesn’t propose bringing schizos back to the reality of capitalism at work in our society. In reality, it can’t come down to bringing the schizo back to this or that social code.

As a result scientific axiomatics are, by nature, the expression within the scientific field of a new type of social registration.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Code / Axiomatics; The Regime of Debt; Capitalist Immanence; Concealment in Axiomatics; Marking – Alliance and Filiation; On Christianity</strong></p><p>… We tried to figure out how the capitalist machine could take the form of a system of immanence, defined by three of the machine’s rather afferent and inter-connected aspects:</p><ol><li><p>A complex system of differential relationships between decoded and deterritorialized flows. This differential system doesn’t replace one code with another or faulty territorialities with new territorialities. The first aspect of capitalist immanence is this kind of bookkeeping axiomatics, which consists in establishing differential relationships between decoded and deterritorialized flows as such.

The second aspect of capitalist immanence is the reproduction of the limits immanent to capital on an ever-larger scale.</p></li><li><p>The general effusion of anti-production into the apparatus of production, to the point that in such a system, no productive activity can occur without attesting to its place in an apparatus of anti-production. A point that allowed us to distinguish between ancient, imperial kinds of bureaucracy and modern bureaucracy, which served to make the apparatus of anti-production permeate throughout all productive activity.</p></li></ol><p>If these are the three aspects of capitalist immanence, as an immanent machine, we can now determine how an axiomatic differs from coding [<em>codage</em>]. Capitalism doesn’t restore code; it ushers in an axiomatic of decoded flows, which only happens to restore code.</p><p>I’m proposing that there are five differences between axiomatics and code, assuming that we won’t find the model for axiomatics in science, though axiomatics does imply that science has reached a certain state, has taken on a certain shape.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-08-8/#_edn2 rel=noopener>2</a> Social axiomatics, which we have to interpret as a sort of extension of scientific axiomatics. On the contrary, it’s scientific axiomatics, or science, that assumes an axiomatic form in a regime, in a form of society that, on its own terms, replaced codes with a properly social, quantifying axiomatic [<em>axiomatique comptable</em>]. Which means that scientific axiomatics, essentially, a new kind of social recording process,
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-08-8/#_edn3 rel=noopener>3</a> expressed in the scientific domain.</p><p>The first difference—in any regime of code, what do we find? A code is never homogeneous; a code is made up of shreds, of chunks, joined together piece-by-piece and, piece- by-piece, crisscrossing a social field. Don’t bother thinking in terms of linguistic homogeneity: a code borrows and mobilizes all sorts of signs; it mixes these signs together, and with this sort of multiplicity particular to code, a grid covers the social field by conjugating really diverse elements.</p><p>Yet, in every code, there are secret zones bound up with whatever collective investments of organs, which is included in any code. I’m saying that the collectivity, the group, invests organs. It’s what [Paul] Parin demonstrates in his frustrating, awful book: <em>Les blancs pensent trop.</em>
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-08-8/#_edn4 rel=noopener>4</a> He does a good job of demonstrating how, if there’s any castration in so-called primitive societies, it comes from the mouth of cousins, based on a collectively invested organ, I believe that the collective investment of organs is a fundamental aspect of code. In <em>Mythologiques</em>, [Claude] Lévi-Strauss demonstrates the collective investment of organs and prohibitions: like, under particular circumstances, given particular conditions, you don’t have the right to use particular organs—which certainly doesn’t imply a defense or prohibition in general, but [it does imply] something positive regarding code, i.e., collective investment.</p><p>All organs are coded, or over-coded: you’re not going to use your eyes in certain conditions, you’re not going to see this. You won’t use your nose, or, on the other hand, you’re called on after a system of initiation. And initiation means marking the body, and what follows are instances of displacement. A mask cannot be understood as the very depiction of a collective investment of organs; what I find so interesting about a mask is the displacement between the organs of the wearer and the organs represented on the mask—for example, those masks where the wearer doesn’t see through the holes in the eyes but through some other orifice. What does that suggest? It suggests this gap between one’s own organs and organs taking on a new capacity by virtue of their collective investment.</p><p>This whole regime of collectively investing organs implies zones that are necessarily secret—you’re not in a position to make use of a collectively invested organ under such-and-such conditions. It requires a system of initiation to reach the point where you can use such an organ under those conditions. We have to bear in mind that such collective investments occur whenever there’s a marking of bodies. Thus, every code harbors secret zones that play a fundamental role… [<em>text missing</em>] Strictly speaking, you could say that, everywhere, the secret weighs down on singular points, singularities of code, singularities of code that appear to be fundamentally linked to organs defined by their collective investment. In a way, nothing is unspeakable. The secret might be that of a secret society, or else it’s something that quite literally cannot be spoken of without contradiction or cannot be spoken of without the system rupturing. There’s no hiding it. The worst crimes—there’s no covering it up, even if they involve secret codes, because concealment is a horse of a different color entirely.</p><p>We ought to maintain a categorical distinction between secrecy and objective concealment. I mean, it’s very different in a capitalist system: you’re told that you don’t have the right to know this, or you don’t have the right to participate in that, because you lack the enjoyment or use of the organ presupposed by such knowledge or such participation. That’s the secret. In code there are two ways of handling the worst crimes: by over-coding one’s organs—<em>you haven’t been coded enough, you did because you escaped the code, so we’re going to over-code you</em>, which might mean torturing you—or else by moving, expelling: <em>get the hell out, get lost</em>. And in primitive societies, you often find a guy who’s been expelled from his territoriality, from his group, who’s gone away. He has a special status; sometimes he gets integrated somewhere else. Consider its latest forms in Greek cities, as the exile. You broke the secret, or you committed a crime—it was the movement of being run off.</p><p>What goes on these days? Every time we try to figure out how this machine works, we run into a wall. It’s been the cornerstone of leftism: <em>we’re going to try and figure out what’s going on in this system</em>! A wall of police, of silence, opposes any such attempt, which leads us to believe that the search for or demand for information is singularly active. It’s awful enough simply knowing what goes on in a factory.  Literally, go to Renault on Émile-Zola, and see to what extent factories are prisons.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-08-8/#_edn5 rel=noopener>5</a> When you want to know what happens in a prison, what you’re dealing with isn’t a secret as a function of code; it’s something else. We must know how a Swiss bank functions.</p><p>Once you concretely understand how a capitalist institution functions, you enter a domain where, literally, you either collapse or you get riled up. It’s a regime that, in one sense, doesn’t tolerate anything even when it comes to the simplest information, doesn’t tolerate anything nearby—on one hand, that’s what makes it fragile, but it makes up for its fragility with a global repressive force which, on the other hand, constitutes its strength. This system isn’t one of secrecy—the striking example of Dr. Rose at Toul, reporting on what goes on in a prison, violating a sort of capitalist understanding that an institution’s participants will be silent; they might object to the institution in principle, but they’re not to say anything about it—[it isn’t a system of secrecy] but a system of concealment [<em>dissimulation</em>], not the subjective, psychological sort of concealment of capitalists, but an objective concealment, per the apparent objective movement of capital.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-08-8/#_edn6 rel=noopener>6</a></p><p>We’d be mistaken were we to say that, in capitalism, there are two forms of money, but we should recognize that the money-form functions in two different ways: as finance and as revenue, financial flows and revenue flows fundamentally linked in a kind of differential relationship, since that’s part of the system of differential relationships at the heart of capitalism. Such a system, with money assuming two forms and there being an established relationship between both forms, can only work on the condition that a fictitious principle of homogeneity is projected between both forms, both figures. Namely, the nature of finance flows and revenue flows is such that, in terms of how they’re related, they appear as though they’re convertible, in the form of a “uniform interest rate” or “gold standard,” and that’s the real purpose of gold in capitalist regimes: rather than preserving it, [its purpose is] fundamentally to cover up [<em>dissimuler</em>] the heterogeneity between both kinds of flows and the nature of the relationship between both kinds of flows.</p><p>I’d say that the first broad, illustrative way of distinguishing code and axiomatics is that codes always function based on and in relation to zones of secrecy, while an axiomatic always functions on the basis and in relation to objective concealment.</p><p>The second point of contrast is this: in a code, due to its fundamental heterogeneities, its fragments linking together piece-by piece, etc., a code or coding always applies to flows. What code specifically does is work out the qualification of flows, independently of how they’re related, i.e., the relationship between coded flows will result from said flows having been qualified by code. For example, in a type of primitive society where, for example, you make out a machine with three or four flows—the flow of objects of consumption, the flow of prestige objects, the flow of rights over human beings (marriages, offspring, women, children, etc.)—I’m saying that code carries out coding, i.e., a qualification of such flows, each having its own circuit, where both the relationships between flows and the places where such relationships are established strictly depend on their first being qualified by way of code.</p><p>For example, in some places, usually on the outskirts of the group’s territory, there might be exchanges between prestige objects and objects of consumption. Such relationships between withdrawn flows [<em>prélèvements sur les flux</em>] are strictly determined by the quality of the flows and each of their own autonomous circuits. We ought to say that code is an indirect system of relations deriving from the qualification of flows that code carries out.</p><p>In an axiomatic, it’s the opposite, and it’s clear why an axiomatic entails a generalized decoding. Now there aren’t indirect relations between flows qualified by code, but on the contrary, the qualification of flows stems from the differential relationships between said flows, flows which possess no quality apart from how they’re situated in their differential relationship. And that’s fundamentally what characterizes axiomatics, that what determines the quality of each flow is the system of differential relationships between flows.</p><p>Example: we can’t talk about a flow of labor and a flow of capital, we can’t qualify these flows independently and prior to the differential relationship between them. And it’s only from the encounter between virtual capitalism and the virtual worker — that is, the differential between both kinds of flows – that will result the qualification of one of these flows as the flow of capital purchasing labor power and the other as the flow of labor purchased by capital. Otherwise, there would be no way of qualifying flows, since if they didn’t actually meet—forming differential relationships between flows with different capacities—if they didn’t actually cross paths, the capitalist would forever remain a capitalist, and the worker, a virtual worker, unable to sell their labor force. In this respect, I can make out a second contrast, and I believe that historically, axiomatics began as a new interpretation, a static and ordinal interpretation of differential calculus, and that that was its origin.</p><p>Third contrast: If it’s true that codes harbor and carry out qualifications of flows—which informs how flows are related to each other, and not the other way around—if that is indeed a point of contrast, I believe we can take the distinction further. In non-capitalist formations, just as flows are qualified and do not form indirect relationships stemming from their prior qualification, at certain points, points which can, by the way, constitute secrets, which can also be the subject of initiation, which is why all these distinctions are linked together. If that’s true, the fact remains that coding consists in a three-part operation precisely because there isn’t one code that spits everything out. Fundamentally, a code is a rule for recording or registering distribution [<em>enregistrement de distribution</em>]. Coding always operates where it affords the means; it’s a system of rules for siphoning off flows [<em>prélèvements sur les flux</em>], breaking off parts of chains [<em>détachements sur les chaînes</em>], and from there, distributing what remains, the residue, to consuming subjects. There are these three sides to any code: siphoning off flows, detaching from chains, and then distributing what’s left. See [Pierre] Bonnafé’s essay in <em>Nouvelle Revue de Psychanalyse</em> on the magic object,
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-08-8/#_edn7 rel=noopener>7</a> where these three aspects of the magic object are delineated very clearly.</p><p>At this level, each fragment of code unites all the heterogeneous aspects at issue in an inherently finite combination, in a mobile, open, and finite combination. In the primitive market, in other words, if we’re sticking to these kinds of flows, there’s always an imbalance because, in point of fact, there is no form of exchange; there’s no form of equivalence. There’s a fundamental imbalance when it comes to each flow qualified in a particular way in the exchange relationship at stake in a combination. In other words, there is no exchange; there’s a system of debt, and debt is fundamentally affected by a functional imbalance, a functional imbalance at the level of each finite combination, involving every aspect of coding and thereby all the different qualified flows, an imbalance compensated for by heterogeneous elements borrowed from another flow.</p><p>For example, the lack of equilibrium between giving and receiving objects of consumption effectively isn’t rebalanced; its imbalance is fundamental, constant. It only works insofar as it’s unbalanced. That’s fundamentally what’s in dispute with Leach and Lévi-Strauss: both agree that there’s an imbalance, Leach claiming that the imbalance is a fundamental aspect of the system, integral to how it functions, while Lévi-Strauss maintains that it’s a pathological outcome of the system. Leach is right. Looking at each flow, each combination, each flow contributing to a compound product, there’s a fundamental imbalance relative to the flows in question, and it’s as though this imbalance were perpetually made up for by siphoning off another flow, a flow with a different character.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-08-8/#_edn8 rel=noopener>8</a></p><p>For example, the imbalance between the one distributing objects for consumption and the one receiving them will be compensated for by drawing off [<em>par un prélèvement</em>] a completely different flow, the flow of prestige, where the distributor gains prestige, or, from a third kind of flow, receives privileges over human beings, or from coats of arms, etc. I’d argue that, at that point, the economic unit in so-called primitive society are fundamentally finite combinations that both in themselves and in their unbalanced way of functioning inherently bring in flows of all different qualities, and there’s a whole cycle of debt that forms around these circulating finite compounds. It’s the regime of finite debt, and the regime of alliances is precisely what delineates the trajectory of finite debt.</p><p>On the other hand, what changes with axiomatics is how the system of finite and mobile combinations gets replaced by a regime of infinite debt, and how infinity fundamentally belongs to the regime of axiomatics, whereas coding implies the finitude of what it codes. And here, too, the infinite appears at the level of capitalist economics in the way money produces money. Marx highlights this infinite growth, whereby money makes money. And in what seems like a different form—but which is only the extension of the first—the infinite of capital, whose mode is the process whereby, at every turn, capital has immanent limits, but limits that it reproduces on an ever-wider scale. In other words, this regime of infinity is one of destruction-creation, and we’ve seen why the money form is necessarily tied to the destruction and creation of money. If there is no axiomatics of infinity <em>vis à vis</em> its form as axiomatics, it is the case that the material such axiomatics bears upon is fundamentally an infinite material. In other words, axiomatics is the system of finite rules structuring a subject matter that itself is properly infinite. That much should be clear for scientific axiomatics, but also at a more basic consideration of axiomatics, of axioms, both as a way of treating and mixing a properly infinite material, one which is accounted for by the axiomatics of the infinite number of possible combinations deriving from the axiomatics itself.</p><p>Just as code is the system of finite debt and finite economics, so too is axiomatics the system of infinite debt. In the most basic terms, we will never fully pay our debt—infinite punishment, infinite repayment—economically, the great shift from archaic codes handling finite matter, with the capitalist sort of axiomatics that instead handle material that’s fundamentally infinite.</p><p>The fourth difference: In a society, whether coded or axiomatized, there’s a basic social component [<em>instance</em>], that of the body without organs, of the unproductive, of anti-production. With so-called primitive societies, we’ve seen that the Earth, as an indivisible entity, acts as the full body, as the body without organs, as the instance of anti-production. In imperial societies, the despot and his two-fold incest, with his sister and his mother—both kinds of incest outlining the two ends of imperial over-coding, one incest at the periphery and one incest at the center, so that everything gets over-coded—it isn’t at all about fecundity. It’s about sterility, one that appropriates all productive forces: nothing must be born from incestuous unions. On the other hand, whatever is born must depend on the sterile union itself, i.e., the great despotic incest—see the case of Oedipus, the club-footed despot—along the surface of the imperial full body, the great despotic incest forms its double union, with sister and mother, thereby ensuring an over-coding of the older territorial codes that are falling apart all over the place.</p><p>And here, indeed, imperial codes get added onto prior territorial codes a new full body, the full body. The body without organs of the despot, acting as an instance of anti-production and projecting [<em>se rabat</em>] onto every productive force, just as the full body of the Earth in so-called primitive societies was projected onto productive forces in order to appropriate them. I believe that, with such code, it’s absolutely necessary for the full body being the appropriation, appropriating the forces of production, to be extra-economic in nature. That is, insofar as it’s a prerequisite for the apparent movement, the objective movement of the recording process [<em>enregistrement</em>] in a particular form of society, it’s inevitable that in a code, this apparent, objective movement emanates from and goes back to a non-economic entity. As Marxists might put it, that doesn’t mean that the state of the economic process isn’t what necessitates erecting such an economic full body, and the apparent movement whereby productive forces are attributed to the full body might come down to the state of these forces themselves.</p><p>The fact remains that, from the point of view of its objective movement, what appropriates productive forces is something extra-economic. Which itself explains the two-fold aspect of how anti-production operates: inhibiting, limiting productive forces on the one hand, and on the other, projecting [<em>se rebattre</em>] onto them in order to appropriate the productive forces. These two aspects are then separated in quality and in temporality from the work of productive forces themselves. The body of the earth, insofar as it both limits and appropriates productive forces, makes use of something it conjugates on its own surface—upon the full body of the earth, the primitive territorial machine conjugates filiations and alliances, a range of filiations and alliances appropriating the productive forces. And as its own nature isn’t economic but geological and political, to the extent that there is a geology of politics, to the extent that the earth is what functions as a full body without organs. With imperial regimes, the full body of the despot securing these same functions shows up as a transcendent instance, an instance of anti-production whose nature is political, administrative, or even religious.</p><p>I believe that capitalist axiomatics offers us the only form society where what plays the role, functions as a full body, becomes a directly economic instance. Something no code could ever withstand; it goes without saying that this is what grounds concealment. It must be hidden, i.e., the full body of such a society is directly economic; it’s money capital. It’s what all flows run on, and what productive forces are attributed to. In contrast to previous systems, there’s no longer a difference in nature or timing between labor and surplus labor. In the worker’s workday, it’s impossible to distinguish—except abstractly, in the form of an arithmetical difference which allegedly belied the true nature of capitalism, the nature of its differential relations—it’s impossible to find the line between labor and surplus labor, as opposed to what happens with despotic over-coding, where the part of labor and the part of surplus labor are qualitatively and temporally distinct.</p><p>The fifth and final point of contrast: just as an aside, when biologists today talk about genetic codes, it’s interesting how they use the word, “code,” because it also has aspects of an axiomatic. We can come at the word, “code,” in two ways. The reason they say there’s a biological code is precisely because everything depends on something extra-chemical, on some entity [<em>instance</em>] or on forms of connection, capable of relating bodies stripped of any chemical affinity, in the same way I was saying that, if we’re talking about code, it’s because there’s some extra-economic instance which productive forces are attributed to. Indeed, whenever we find an entity whose objective appearance is external to or transcends the field of linkage in question, then we’re dealing with code.</p><p>And the second characteristic that supports modern biological code being code is that it’s a system of indirect relationships—for example, with so-called allosteric bodies, where any relationship can only be indirect, precisely because the bodies involved have no chemical affinity. Under both these aspects, the concept of code is perfectly justifiable. In an axiomatic, there are direct relationships that qualities are derived from, and the appropriating entity is itself economic.</p><p>In both codes and axiomatics, people aren’t what gets marked. Code marks flows, only in a primitive society, flows are marked according to how poorly developed productive forces are. Flows are marked based on organs, and the fact that flows are coded implies the collective investment of organs—this shows up with cultural relativists—the investment of organs is integral to coding flows, and it motivates the whole system of prohibitions. I suppose that such prohibitions are only a cover for some positive operation, this process of collectively investing organs. On the other hand, with capitalism, we’ve always said that it’s built on the basis of a generalized decoding, and decoding doesn’t affect flows without also affecting organs. Organs have gone through a fundamental collective disinvestment. The first organ to have been disinvested was the anus (see Max Weber). We can’t ignore how African mythology illustrates that, whenever organs get disinvested, organic codes, the coding of organs, will lean towards the anus. The other organs followed. If this collective disinvestment of organs is what we call castration, then the anus is what’s behind the main castration, and the phallus, as a transcendent object, wouldn’t exist were it not for what the anus does. Oedipus is anal, from top to bottom.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-08-8/#_edn9 rel=noopener>9</a></p><p>What led to a collective disinvestment of organs in capitalism? It’s like, go ahead and use your eyes, your mouth, your anus, do whatever you want—our collective investments no longer involve collectively investing organs; your organs are your business. How come? Because the collective investment of organs always points back to something essential about code, that code is a machine for ripping up alliances with filiations. If I use the word, “machine,” it’s to indicate that it isn’t an axiomatic, nor is it a deductive system. Alliances are never drawn from filiations; they never follow or are deduced from filiations. There’s a machine that conjugates alliances with filiations, a machine that does something incredible when it comes to code, where the form of social reproduction goes through the form of human reproduction, and where the family, whether in the narrow or broad sense, is always a protocol, a strategy, a tactical approach in a society of codes. In other words, the family is anything but familial. The family is the direct embodiment of investments in the extra-familial social field, and there it acquires its strategic function as it conjugates alliances with filiations.</p><p>In that sense, it’s coextensive with the social field insofar as family stimuli are like bases, elements of social investment, which is another way of saying that social reproduction goes through human reproduction, hence the need for a collective coding of organs. Everything changes in imperial societies, yet it remains the same. The whole system of alliances and filiations in primitive communities is preserved, and the specifically despotic category of the new alliance is overlayed on top of it. It’s a new category of alliances; the despot ushers in new alliances which direct filiations derive from. Imperial societies keep it so that social reproduction, at both ends, takes the form of human reproduction: at one end, the despot’s reproduction, the despot’s body without organs addressing the question of the dynasty, and at the other end, the village communities still upholding the regime of ancient alliances and indirect filiation.</p><p>In capitalism, alliances and filiations retain their old meanings, only now in the context of the full body’s new characteristics, as money capital. Capital is now what the categories of alliances and filiations are attributed to. We enter a regime of new alliances, and filiation is the process whereby capital produces money as industrial capital. Industrial capital is the capital of filiation, while alliance capital is market capital in its banking and its commercial forms. And it’s true about capitalism that, in its essence, in its specificity as a form of society, it is industrial—neither the merchant nor the banker would have been enough to establish the capitalist system. Had it not been for industrialization, they would have still found their roles and functions in the pores (as Marx puts it) of the previous form of society. Pores which are the little holes on the body without organs, whether territorial or despotic.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-08-8/#_edn10 rel=noopener>10</a></p><p>It’s true that the essence and specificity of capitalism lies in the industrial process whereby capital buys the means of production and the labor power of the deterritorialized worker. But if the specificity of capitalism resides with industrial capital, on the other hand, the functioning of capitalism is determined by banking and commercial capital, which then become fully autonomous and take on a leading role, based industrial capital. From there, it’s appropriate to say that filiation is now something about capital, in the form of filial capital, money generating money <em>ad infinitum</em>, and on the other hand, alliance is a capital thing in the form of alliance capital, in the form of banking and trade. Then, not only does the registration of capital not apply to people, but neither does it apply to organs: capital is now geared towards alliances and filiations.</p><p>In capitalism, in an axiomatic regime, social reproduction no longer takes the form of human reproduction. Which means that the form of human reproduction stops determining, informing social reproduction. To put it like some of Aristotle’s commentators, human reproduction is now only the form of the material; social reproduction still needs material, material provided by human reproduction, but the form of social reproduction has become independent of the form of familial reproduction. The family is no longer a protocol or strategy.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-08-8/#_edn11 rel=noopener>11</a> What is the purpose of human reproduction then? Among the characteristics of the capitalist machine we looked at earlier, one was that differential relationships have an internal limit that’s reproduced on an ever-broader scale, whereby they ward off and drive back capitalism’s real external limit, schizophrenia.</p><p>As for capitalism pushing its schizo-limit back further and further, its first method for doing so was to substitute internal limits, to be reproduced on a larger and larger scale. The act of displacing its limit, the different scales of capital. But there’s another way in which its limit gets displaced, since the form of human reproduction no longer shapes social reproduction, precisely because the latter is secured by filiation capital and alliance capital, insofar as they’ve taken it upon themselves to conjugate alliance and filiation—the reproduction of capital, in and of itself, no longer needs human reproduction except for as a material. The limit gets displaced in a second way: far from being a strategic and tactical impulse coextensive with the entire social field, the family now forms a subset to which… far from lending its form to social reproduction, [it is a subset] whose form is imposed by social reproduction, and social reproduction will intersect with its entire form and every aspect of its form. This second displacement isn’t about internal limits which are ever-expanding, but internal limits which are ever-narrowing. That’s not a contradiction, since it comes down to two completely different displacements, which are closely interrelated: just as capital takes over the functions of alliance and filiation and thus reproduces itself on a wider and wider scale, the form of human reproduction characterizes a more and more limited milieu, whereupon the now-autonomous capitalist social field can be reflected [<em>se rabattre</em>], applied to as its sub-set.</p><p>So much to say that: the more capitalist axiomatics distances itself from code, operating according to its always-expanding internal limits, the more restricted its field of application needs to be, and every capitalist determination finds its field of application in one sub-set, that of the family.</p><p>In <em>La Paix blanche</em> [The White Peace],
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-08-8/#_edn12 rel=noopener>12</a> [Robert] Jaulin analyzes the example of deals missionaries make with Indians [<em>sic</em>]. The missionaries say, “We’re going to build small personal houses for you”—we’re witnessing the birth of Oedipus—“You’ll have your own place, no more collective houses.” And the Indians [<em>sic</em>] agree to it, thinking, this is the first time that white people are offering us part of their lives, so the Indians offer something from their own lives as well; they build a big collective house. A church! So, here’s what Jaulin says, which sounds to me exactly like the birth of Oedipus: “The condition of the colonized can lead to a reduction in the humanization of the universe, so that any solution that is sought will be a solution on the scale of the individual and the restricted family.”
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-08-8/#_edn13 rel=noopener>13</a> To that, I’ll add that there’s an initial displacement of the limit. The limit is brought, in the condition of the colonized, to a more and more restricted scale: before, the Indian [<em>sic</em>] had whatever social field, and they invested it along with the social reproduction in said field. With its open family, its system of alliance and filiation, as Jaulin says, “the reduction of the humanization of the universe,” the limit of this field is no longer territorial or inter-territorial between allied groups, and undergoes a bizarre reflection [rabattement] where social reproduction completely escapes the Indian [<em>sic</em>]. It’s taken over by the colonizer, and it’s brought back under its limit: _you will no longer believe that the one who gave you life is a chief—_we <em>are the chief. The one who gave you life is just your dad.</em>
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-08-8/#_edn14 rel=noopener>14</a></p><p>See also [Victor] Turner’s account of the village where the chieftainship has been abolished, you get pinned down with a tighter and tighter limit, “with, by way of consequence, an extreme anarchy or disorder at the level of the collective: an anarchy whose victim will always be the individual—with the exception of those who occupy the key positions in such a system, namely the colonizers, who, during this period when the colonizers reduce the universe, will tend to extend it.”
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-08-8/#_edn15 rel=noopener>15</a> His text offers us a way of expressing the connection between two displacements of the limit.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-08-8/#_edn16 rel=noopener>16</a> As the universe of the colonized shrinks, we see the limit makes two complementary moves: on the one hand, the internal limit expands further and further, and on the other hand, the internal limit defines a smaller and smaller subset, which becomes less and less capable of influencing the mechanisms of reproduction. In other words, the history and the constitution of the Western world, this heterogeneous whole, which can be taken up at any time and in any of its regions… [<em>Text interrupted</em>]</p><p>…this development concerning small personal houses represents the second way the limit gets displaced, and this is what Jaulin says: he gives us his depiction of the earlier collective houses, and from what I can gather it isn’t about there being large families. It’s not that the so-called primitive family was large; the houses were collective because fundamentally, as a strategy, insofar as it determines the form of social reproduction, they were open to the outside, to what Jaulin calls the other. What’s more, as a family, as subject to the investments of individual members, what the individual invests through [the family] are non-familial determinations in their social field: the land, alliances, etc. [The family] is fundamentally open to the other, i.e., to what isn’t family—to the ally, if you will.</p><p>Which certainly doesn’t suggest any shortcoming in the structure of the family. The fact that, under capitalism, it’s now no more than material lends it a powerful function. It assumes a very specific function under capitalist axiomatics. I think that with capitalist systems, all revolutionary forms are those that break down, slip out from under the axiomatics of order. The problem we always run into is how to ensure that acts of decoding, acts of deterritorialization, are both revolutionarily positive and don’t recreate some perverse or artificial version of the family, i.e., that they don’t form their own codes and territorialities.</p><p>I’ll elaborate using a somewhat less flashy example: psychiatry. Psychoanalysis has always been equal parts lovely and lousy. I’m of the persuasion that theories are formed piece-meal; the lovely is mixed in with the lousy. What’s great about Freud is that you’ll find gems and eyesores on the same page. Psychoanalysis entails—and here, it’s revolutionary—breaking down codes, a kind of decoding of desire (<em>Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality</em>). At high moments, we learn that dream interpretation shouldn’t be confused for the dream dictionaries from Antiquity, because dream dictionaries are codes. Don’t mistake that for psychoanalysis! But in the same book, this trickster gives us his account of Oedipus, and he doesn’t know what to do with it; he’s making a code. They make detention centers with groups, if necessary, almost militant groups, and what they’re up against: preventing artificial families from forming again, artificial Oedipuses, at which point they’d be reterritorializing, recoding. The question is how to make way for decoded, positive, and revolutionary flows without reconstituting depraved families. That’s the danger with militant groups.</p><p>In terms of the unconscious and how it relates to the social field, the territoriality of the party is a fundamental danger. How can there be a revolutionary link between people that mobilizes the libido, that mobilizes Eros, Desire, but doesn’t wind up trapped in the coded or axiomatized structures of Oedipus? It’s a problem at the level of practice.</p><p>[<em>Unrecorded discussion about the burial of Pierre Overney</em>]
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-08-8/#_edn17 rel=noopener>17</a></p><p>… Jaulin does a good job of demonstrating how intimacy or one’s private life were completely upheld for the different families in the confines of a collective home,
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-08-8/#_edn18 rel=noopener>18</a> since the family is always open to the non-family, to the ally. Collective houses provide small, private territorialities open to the ally, and there are rules for alliance and filiation so that some things are not permitted of allies. There’s some kind of intense private life, which doesn’t prevent the Indian [<em>sic</em>] in the collective home, by way of this private life, from investing the whole group. Jaulin, on the subject of individual houses: “There occurred an excessive ferment of the elements of the group”—he saw the urban state of Oedipus—“affecting the group itself most often results in exacerbating each element’s familial or sociological characteristics and is translated by a domestic opposition experienced in the home, between the couple’s original ‘dimensions.’ Children are tossed around in this system, each (parent) vying to ‘hoard’ them for themselves, i.e., for the sake of their reference lineage.”
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-08-8/#_edn19 rel=noopener>19</a> Oedipus is born!</p><p>Oedipus, for us cultured Europeans, is our little internal colony, and for Indians or Africans, it’s forced colonization. It’s one of the most immediate products of colonization, taking the form of: your father isn’t what you think, i.e., an agent of social reproduction, end of story. Social reproduction involves every colonizer. Jaulin says that, at that point, he looks at the kid, and one says, “he’s from my lineage,” and the other says “he’s from my lineage.” They take the kid by the arm and ask what the child prefers, which doesn’t come up in a regime of alliance or filiation, i.e., in the lineage machine, because there’s a system for visitation, for opening up to the outside, where lineage isn’t a problem.</p><p>Why does the capitalist system’s internal limit get displaced in two conjoined ways, as the more and more protracted reproduction of social limits, on an ever-wider scale, and consequently with increasingly narrow limits circumscribing the family? And how are the two related? Capitalist axiomatics, insofar as it concerns a regime where social reproduction has become autonomous, needs a subset for its application. As social reproduction, it’s constitutive of a first kind of image: the capitalist, the industrialist, the banker, the worker—the first order of images produced by social axiomatics. Consequently, its limits increasingly tighten around the family, which is where axiomatics finds its application, furnished by a second order of images. The second images are those formed using the material of human reproduction, i.e., family figures: daddy, mommy, me.</p><p>What capitalist political economy needs is a process called psychoanalysis. Psychoanalysis is the application whereby political economy defines its corresponding axiomatics. A perfectly acceptable formula.</p><p>There is transcendence not just when flows are coded, but when, on top of territorial codes, which don’t invoke any transcendence, which are an underlying system, a despotic over-coding is overlayed. Then there’s transcendence. The question of Christianity’s imperial character immediately shows up in the very form of catholicity, i.e., of one transcendent universal, or one truth for all religions. And historically, the way it shows up bears on the very essence of early Christianity: what will be our relationship with the Roman Empire, a decadent form of empire? In other words, do we go with entrism, using the debris of the Roman Empire to end up rebuilding a spiritually motivated empire? Or should we dissolve the Roman empire, start from scratch, return to the desert? Return to the desert in order to recreate a despotic formation from this sort of pact with the Roman Empire; we’ll build despotic formations from scratch, i.e., from anchorites, from convents. Early Christianity’s return to the East, against the Christians allying themselves with the Romans; in that respect, Christianity is like the last great imperial form of society. Indeed, what we might call the transcendent regime of infinite debt really begins with the great empires. What real punishment looks like has changes; all countries have made a sacred pact—you aren’t getting out of it; the debt is infinite.</p><p>But I wouldn’t say that Christianity offers us a dialectic of transcendence and immanence. What I would say is that it comes in bits and pieces. On the one hand, it’s the final attempt to rebuild an imperial society, but with this imperial form of society, the conditions are such that it cannot be rebuilt that way. It has to be formed spiritually, i.e., the great empires are what establish infinite debt, what Nietzsche refers to as a cunning ploy: it takes some troubling artists to pull it off, but infinite debt was still external. The trick with Christianity—and this is very closely tied to its becoming—is that it not only subjects us to the regime of infinite debt, but the regime of internalized infinite debt. On the one hand, there’s the aspect of despotic formation renewed by Christianity, and on the other hand, there’s the way its formation lies deep within the development of capitalism, where it’s no longer a regime of transcendence, but one of immanence.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-08-8/#_edn20 rel=noopener>20</a></p><p>With immanence, assuming that it runs on an axiomatic and no longer on code, there’s no more need for belief. Religion as belief only makes sense in the context of Christianity’s place in an imperial form of society. When it comes to axiomatics, it’s no longer a question of belief. That’s why Christianity, as contemporary to capitalism, as we see it now, has always been like this: who cares whether they believe or not? It rubs me the wrong way granting Christianity an autonomy in terms of belief or religion because, when it goes through its conversion from transcendence to immanence, in its immanent aspect where it belong to capitalism, Christianity is <em>the</em> religion, and what makes it the religion of capitalism is that it doesn’t operate in terms of belief. What they care about is it being the main religion, and looking at it that way, it’s no longer a religion once belief isn’t what matters. But Christianity guarantees a certain production of images in capitalism, and a certain relationship between such images, images which are part of the way in which the apparatus of capitalist immanence is fed. Religion is part of the economic machine.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-08-8/#_edn21 rel=noopener>21</a></p><p>This business with the two poles of Christianity is the same as what we get with the death drive. Consider how death is coded in primitive systems: there is no death drive because it is more or less coded. It’s when territorial codes break down that the death drive starts to show up, in processes of decoding. In imperial and despotic systems, the lion of the despot and death is ensured by a phenomenon that belongs to despotic formations—Freud lumped everything together under imperial forms of society, which is why he didn’t understand capitalism—latency, everyone has a good laugh when latency comes up. Why did Freud invent latency? The real point of latency’s implementation was as a historical determination, concerning the fate of despotic formations. Namely, why they were afflicted with a collective forgetfulness, which put them into a latent state—why the Greeks, the Egyptians, the Africans rejected, tamped down their imperial past into latency.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-08-8/#_edn22 rel=noopener>22</a></p><p>How did the Greeks forget Mycenae? In despotic forms of society, the death drive is the great transcendent instance of anti-production, and it gets over-coded in the form of the new alliance, the revenge of the new alliance. Death is over-coded and turned into a veritable transcendent instinct. At the same time, for despotic regimes, it’s a transcendent instinct because mortifying anti-production is separate from production, separated both in quality and in time. With capitalism, death is decoded: the whole apparatus of mortifying anti-production effuses into production. Freud says that the death drive is something transcendent and silent… [<em>End of session</em>]</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p><a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-08-8/#_ednref1 rel=noopener>1</a> Deleuze and Guattari flesh out this analysis in <em>Anti-Oedipus</em>, especially in Chapter Three, under the section, “The Civilized Capitalist Machine,” which begins on p. 222.</p><p><a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-08-8/#_ednref2 rel=noopener>2</a> This line of analysis gets developed in <em>Anti-Oedipus</em>, starting around p. 248.</p><p><a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-08-8/#_ednref3 rel=noopener>3</a> See the translators’ note for “<em>enregistrement</em>” on <em>Anti-Oedipus,</em> p. 4.</p><p><a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-08-8/#_ednref4 rel=noopener>4</a> Text untranslated.

Only here, we must immediately add a second point: Barely has the political economy done that, and … it must be said at the same time, at the same time as that it does that, it does something else too . … which is what? There too, we must follow, it seems to me, this idea from Marx regarding political economy, this activity of producing or of undetermined work, this abstract work, this deterritorialized work, hardly does the political economy discovers this than, Marx tells us, [the economy] realienates it.</p></blockquote><p><em>While the transcript of this final session of seminar 1 is divided into two specific parts, the second section (bearing the title “The body without organs”) seems incomplete given its brevity. With Deleuze returning to session 6’s discussion of Marx’s analysis of bourgeois political economy and to analyses from sessions 7 and 8, this session serves in many ways as a review of the intersections between psychoanalysis and political economy, hence material corresponding to both to chapters I and III of <em>Anti-Oedipus</em>. Following Marx, Deleuze says that a new form of realienation occurred for economy, within conditions of private property, i.e. wealth as the generalized activity of production detached from any object, and subjective essence realienated in a system of subjective representation for desire. The coordinates for desire determined as libido are within the familial act, specifically Oedipal coordinates, suggesting that in this shift, psychoanalysts created an entirely ambiguous relationship with myth and tragedy, a new reterritorialized form emerging either as the bourgeois family or bourgeois private property. Deleuze outlines two steps in this process: on one hand, human beings that furnish a labor force gain an abstract equality insofar as such individuals and the family gain a theoretically equal value from the perspective of capital’s reproduction. On the other hand, social reproduction creates an overlap between economic and political figures and specifically familial figures. Under the capitalism’s axiomatic, psychoanalysis becomes the necessary application corresponding to capitalism’s political economy, three aspects of which Deleuze outlines. Deleuze concludes this first part of the session by considering how psychoanalysis reveals its own ambition of constituting its own axiomatic, at once in direct relation to the real, but also breaking with political economy. In the brief final section, Deleuze returns to discuss the body without organs as an intensive matrix, crisscrossed by flows, notably delirium crossing thresholds of intensity and between thresholds. He then begins to outline this process on four kinds of body without organs (masochistic, addicted, schizophrenic, hysterical). For the masochist body, the intensity is that of pain; for the addicted body, the intensity is that of cold and heat; as for the schizo and hysterical bodies, Deleuze seems to liken these to the egg’s systems of coordinates, and he closes this final fragment with discussion of the intensive grids and flows of the egg’s topology.</em></p><p><strong>Marx-Freud; Capitalism; Despotism-Axiomatics</strong></p><p><strong>Part I</strong></p><p>In his attempt to pin down the birth of bourgeois political economy, Marx is very clear: he claims that bourgeois political economy was established as soon as wealth was no longer linked to an external objective element, to an extrinsic objective element, but [became tied] to subjective activity as such, i.e., not to any determinate objectity but to indeterminate subjective activity.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-09-7/#_edn1 rel=noopener>1</a> See, Marx says, there was no political economy in the way we mean it now; there was the analysis of wealth, and the analysis of wealth fundamentally comes down to relating wealth to some determinate objectity; it varies. This determinate objectity is the earth [<em>terre</em>].
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-09-7/#_edn2 rel=noopener>2</a> For mercantilists, wealth is essentially tied to a determinate objectity, the state, as the distributor of money.</p><p>Now, we have to pay attention to what Marx is saying: there was no political economy. When does political economy come about? It begins as soon as wealth is essentially tied to indeterminate activity, in relation to which no objective element is privileged over any other. That is, it’s when so-called economists begin to distinguish what they call labor, which includes agricultural labor as much as manufacturing or industrial labor… [<em>text missing</em>] defining the general act of producing-whatever, which the field of political economy makes possible. Thus, the tipping point behind political economy involves relating wealth not to any determinate objectity, but to subjective activity, defined as general production. Now, that’s basically what [Adam] Smith and [David] Ricardo do. But I’m wondering whether, given this basic assumption concerning the very foundation of political economy, something is at stake in our analysis, though it seems like merely a parallel for the moment.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-09-7/#_edn3 rel=noopener>3</a></p><p>Now, in the same way, or in an analogous way, what stands out in Freud’s early work? It’s a completely analogous kind of shift. Namely, just as political economy hinges on the revelation that the essence of wealth no longer lies in any determinate objectity but is based on a general subjective activity—production—the reversal Freud carries out in terms of desire is analogous.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-09-7/#_edn4 rel=noopener>4</a> Perhaps it’s the only circumstance in which desire’s fundamentally unconscious nature could come to light, i.e., when desire is associated with a general subjective activity, a general productivity, which Freud will name—highlighting the originality of his discovery—will name the <em>libido.</em></p><p>And, just at the surface-level of the text, what’s so striking about his <em>Three Essays</em>? In particular, it’s how Freud demonstrates that desire, as libido, cannot be identified with just any objects, cannot be identify with just any sources, cannot be identified with just any goals—as if the libido, as subjective activity, held the key to the objects it selected, the sources it channeled through, and the goals it intended. So, in that respect, in the same way that, in the context of political economy, wealth gets linked to general productive activity instead of being linked to an objectity, the essence of desire will from the very beginning—and this might be the very start of psychoanalysis, and it’s why the <em>Three Essays</em> portrays a kind of contingency in its sources, a kind of contingency in its objects, a kind of contingency in its aim within sexuality, in the realm of sexuality—it all ties back to so-called libidinal production, an activity producing symptoms, deviations, perversions.</p><p>In this respect, it seems to me that we’re looking at is still merely a parallel; we have to ask ourselves what makes them similar, whether it isn’t anything more than that. At the same time, it’s already something more. How so? Why does it already feel like it’s more than that? I see it as fundamental, but the sign that psychoanalysis—as much as political economy—belongs to the world of… [<em>text missing</em>] namely, that when we locate the essence of wealth in a subjective activity beyond objects, beyond aims, beyond entities, beyond objectities, that’s only the aftershock of the most deep-rooted process of the capitalist domain, the movement of deterritorialization. The deterritorialization of the capitalist form of wealth, whereby wealth is now only understood as a function of any-and-all productive activity and no longer as a function of some determinate element, neither the earth nor the state, and the process of deterritorializing desire, which can no longer be reduced to its objects, goals, or sources.</p><p>But we should immediately add that, right after that happens with political economy—we shouldn’t even say “right after,” we ought to say “as soon as”— as soon as that happens, something else takes place. As soon as it breaks ties with objectities, as soon as it lays bare a general form of productive activity, there’s something else that takes place. What? Here again, I think, we should pay attention to how Marx develops this with respect to political economy, this idea of productive activity or indeterminate labor, abstract labor, deterritorialized labor—no sooner than it gets discovered by political economy, it gets alienated again. Only look, he’s very explicit—don’t worry about the concept of alienation; Marx’s point is that this re-alienation doesn’t entail returning to a form of objectity. It’s a completely new form of alienation. Instead of alienating the activity of production into something—the earth, the state—such that its activity cannot be grasped, cannot even be perceived or made out, right, instead of alienating it as a thing, as an objectity, as the state of a thing, just as the activity of production comes to light, it gets re-alienated as an act, and not at all as a state. Thus, it’s not a return to how things were before; what gets re-alienated is the act itself.</p><p>And when it’s re-alienated as an act, what form does that take? It is re-alienated under the conditions of private property. And that strikes me as crucial because private property doesn’t show up in Marx as some new objectity in the world of capitalism, but as the form of a new type of alienation, alienation in action, as opposed to alienation as the state of something. Which, I think, amounts to saying that political economy simultaneously cuts ties with major objective representations, representations of the earth, the state. Thanks to this rupture, the essence of wealth is revealed to be general productive activity, subjective activity that cannot be reduced to an object. At the same time, this subjective essence is re-alienated in a completely different way—not circling back to a state of things, but a re-alienation in action. That is, it gets re-alienated not in some new objective representation but instead through systems of subjective representation. And the system of subjective representation is that of private property.</p><p>At this stage, so far, so good; all the more reason, I think, to explore the seeming parallel situation in psychoanalysis. I mean, all you need to do is change the words; that’s all we’re doing. Why are the situations so aligned, and why is it more than a mere similarity? All one has to do is swap some words out to see this play out in psychoanalysis. Namely, how at the same time as he cuts ties with the system of objective representation linking desire to extrinsic elements, to objects, to aims, Freud actually reveals its subjective essence as the libido. But at the same time, he re-alienates—not as another state of things, but as something equivalent to private property, something that certainly isn’t identical. We’ll have to say how they’re related, what the realm of subjective representation will be when it comes to desire, just as private property was the realm of subjective representation for labor-production. This time, desire’s essence, understood as libido—which cannot be understood in terms of objects, in terms of its aims, in terms of its sources—will get re-alienated in action, in the act itself, i.e., in family actions. And its system of subjective representation will be represented through oedipal coordinates.</p><p>Hence it seems to me that, literally, without forcing anything, it’s the same development, the same discovery, and the discovery is used in the same way—whether it’s the revelation that wealth essentially belongs to a subject as general production, which is subsequently re-alienated as an activity in terms of private property, or whether it’s the Freudian revelation that desire, as subjective activity, can only be understood as libido, beyond the objects and aims of desire, which is immediately re-alienated—not as a state of things but as an activity, using the coordinates of the family. It’s the same story. What I’d like to emphasize, then, is: in both the economic discovery and the psychoanalytic discovery, there’s simultaneously something irreducible, something specific, as well as something non-specific. There’s a real cut-off, and there’s a way to recover what’s been cut off. And yet, the rupture is there—I’m referring to psychoanalysis’s extremely ambiguous attitude towards the whole subject of myth and tragedy.</p><p>I say “ambiguous” because, from a certain perspective, there’s a profound disconnect between psychoanalysis and mythology, and then from another point of view, there are attempts to invoke or reinvoke an approach to mythology, one that purports to be new and purports to be incommensurable to the way, to the way experts think about mythology. I mean, why do we get the feeling that ethnologists or Hellenists and psychoanalysts seem to be constantly talking past one another? Both their approaches are actually irreducible. How does a Hellenist approach a myth? As a historian, they bring myths back to some underlying objectity, which the myth expresses in a particular way… [<em>text missing</em>] With psychoanalysis, they don’t believe in myths or tragedies. Myths and tragedies are never linked to any objectity whatsoever because that’s beside the point for analysis. Myths aren’t correlated to the earth’s demands; tragedies aren’t correlated to the despot’s demands. In other words, psychoanalysis doesn’t treat myth and tragedy as objective representations to be understood as referring back to their corresponding objectities.</p><p>What do they do? While there is a real critique of myth and tragedy, and they are devalued in an odd sort of way, at the same time, there is—in a completely different way, not at all contradictory—at the same time, there’s a curious revalorization of myth and tragedy because, rather than taking them to be objective representations that ought to be understood by way of some objectity holding the key to the society in question, psychoanalysis treats myth and tragedy as subjective representations fully capable of expressing the subjective essence of desire, of the libido. And I think that’s why, in the history of psychoanalysis, there’s this strange ambivalence regarding myth and tragedy, this two-faced impression we get that varies from period to period: there’s a long period where psychoanalysts made major inquiries into myth, into tragedy. And then we also sense how Freud sort of takes back over, especially given his break with Jung, where some doubt is cast on psychoanalytic interpretations of myth and tragedy.</p><p>I think we need to pay attention to what’s going on here in order to understand this double aspect: they devalue myth and tragedy specifically because desire is no longer tied to some big objectities that might have shown up through myths and tragedies. At the same time, they revalorize and take myth and tragedy further than ever before, because before, they were associated with objectities that governed how they were used and interpreted. Now, with psychoanalysis, myth and tragedy sort of take on the capacity to fully express the universality of the libido, since they’re understood as subjective representations corresponding to the libido-as-production. So that, at some level, we find a kind of false belief in psychoanalysis. Psychoanalysis will come running back to, in a modified form—we might call it a form of denial—to everything that was once believed: Oedipus, the earth, everything is brought back.</p><p>In other words, to make a long story short, they leave behind objective representation—whether it’s economists or psychoanalysts. They discover subjective activity, and they reestablish a new form of representation, subjective representation itself. They tie it back down, i.e., in the terms I used before, no sooner than they uncover a deterritorialized essence, deterritorialized desire, one no longer tied to any objectity, deterritorialized labor—as soon as it gets revealed, it gets reterritorialized, only it doesn’t simply go back. They reterritorialize it in a new way: either under the conditions of the bourgeois family or the conditions of bourgeois private property.</p><p>If what I’m saying is true, in short, that there appears to be a parallel situation with what happens in economics and what happens in psychoanalysis—if that’s really the case, why? Why both processes? Why was productive activity discovered twice, once as labor and again as desire? And not only why it came up twice, but why were they re-alienated into subjective representations—on the one hand, private property, on the other, the family? Why these two moments? It seems to me that we ought to look for our answer in the structure of capitalism itself.</p><p>Generally speaking, what stands out as specifically characteristic of capitalism? I believe it’s that there’s a certain disconnect between social production and, if you will, between the form of social production and the form of human production. Why? With objectities, social production is never independent from a social form of human reproduction as such. What I mean is that the way in which wealth is reproduced is never independent of the categories of human production, i.e., the two basic categories of human production: alliance and descent [<em>filiation</em>]. And it goes through a social machine, a machine conjugating alliances and lines of descent—never deriving alliances from descent, obviously. Alliance is never derived from a kinship system [<em>un régime filiatif</em>]; the two are conjugated within a social machine, which can vary quite a bit. The need for social reproduction to depend on the form of human reproduction is evidenced precisely by this machine conjugating alliances and lines of descent. In other words, wealth is reproduced in a series of relationships determined by how humans are reproduced.</p><p>Which is why under such conditions, the family, however we’re considering the family, is really a strategy investing the entire social field, whether as the most basic family, conjugating alliances and lines of descent, or later as big empires, where we get fundamental categories indicating a shift, such a crucial shift—however, that’s not what I’m getting at, which is that a despotic form of society brings with it categories that originate new alliances and, therefore, a new kind of descent.</p><p>The despot is really the new alliance type. He’s someone who tells his people, “I bring you a new covenant [<em>alliance</em>].” In any case, the form of human reproduction then completely changes, which is clear when we look at the type of dynasty (see the Chinese). Really, the dynasty comes down to a new alliance—their differences here don’t matter—under another lens; the fundamental difference is that between primitive forms of alliance and descent and the new alliance. But at this juncture, that doesn’t matter; at any rate, social reproduction involves a determinate form of human reproduction, a determinate form concerning alliances and lines of descent.</p><p>In capitalism, there’s a clear departure from both primitive contexts, i.e., territorial systems, and from imperial systems, and for one simple reason: money-capital takes charge of both descent and alliance. Lines of descent and alliances now fall under capital and become its immediate properties. They don’t really need to go through humans anymore. Strike that—there <em>is</em> a need for humans, but in a very different way from before. As I’ll explain in a moment, humans will be necessary as a resource [<em>matériau</em>], which effectively means that descent falls under capital as a bona fide filiative capital [<em>capital filiatif</em>].</p><p>Now, filiative capital is well accounted for in Marx: it’s the production of surplus value. How is money able to produce money? The way money produces money in the capitalist system, under capitalist conditions, i.e., capital producing surplus value, is what we described earlier as <em>x = Dx</em>, what Marx calls the expansion of money, demonstrating how capital appropriates descent, as industrial capital. Previously, I tried to show how, on the other hand, as opposed to industrial capital, market capital is alliance capital, without which capitalist industry would not function, which determines, which has a determinant role in relation to industrial capital. Market capital is the form in which capital really is alliance capital.</p><p>Well, alliance and descent are no longer determinations of human reproduction and are now determinations whereby money produces money and allies itself with money. Henceforth, I understand that, as with any system, there <em>de facto</em> need to be guys in capitalism. Social reproduction no longer presupposes a form of human reproduction. In other words, everything’s as though what capitalism basically does is take human reproduction and its form—the form of human reproduction as in the most general sense of the word “family”—out of the social domain. At the same time, of course, there is a need for guys. What do I mean by that?</p><p>Here again, that’s not to say it returns to an earlier stage, but it means that human reproduction continues to have a form. In the capitalist regime it’s the form of the family, but on its own, as human reproduction, it’s no more than resource material for the application of the reproduction of capital, which has its own form, i.e., it’s the material that gets applied to. Which is what? Of course, this resource material has its own form; there’s a form of the material. In the capitalist system, the form of the material of human reproduction is the family. But the form of social reproduction no longer involves the form of this material; the family’s only function is to inform, to give a form to human reproduction, a form subordinate to the autonomous form of social reproduction.</p><p>Where does that leave us, then? It seems we ought to distinguish between two stages. When it comes to capitalist regimes, the form of social reproduction must be applied to a resource of human reproduction, that is, families or human reproduction must provide human beings whose place it will not determine by itself but will determine based on how the family is situated within social reproduction, i.e., you have your capital, you have your labor power. It’s inevitable, then, that capitalism fosters a certain abstract equality. Precisely because the form of human reproduction is, as it were, removed from the social field, with social reproduction taking other means and having its own form in capital itself. And for this very reason, the family can be thought of abstractly as the production of individuals who, in the abstract, are all equal since they receive their social standing, their basic social inequality, from the other form of reproduction, social reproduction as such, i.e., the reproduction of capital.</p><p>But then, at the same time—and this is what I find so crucial—this social reproduction must in some way be applied, the form of social reproduction must in some way be applied to the form of human reproduction. A system of correspondence must be established between the form of social reproduction, whose secret lies in the ownership of capital, and the extrinsic form of human reproduction, determined as a family in the capitalist world. So that social reproduction no longer goes through human reproduction; it’s assumed its own form, obtained a form of its own. But at the same time, it bears witness to a fundamental need, based on what we’ve just seen, to apply itself to the form of human reproduction itself. And it involves the political-economic figures of the social field sort of reflecting [<em>une espèce de rabattement</em>] onto the family roles particular to the family field. Namely, in the social political-economic field, we have the capitalist, the banker, the industrialist, the worker—and in familial reproduction, we have the father, the mother, and the child. And precisely because the form of social reproduction no longer involves the form of human reproduction but instead finds in the form of human reproduction a mere form for its own resource material, the first man, social reproduction, is reflected [<em>se fait un rabattement</em>] onto the figures of human reproduction. So, here, it’s clear why this double ligature is necessary: that once subjective activity is shown to be production, that this subjective activity is revealed once to be production recoded, represented in the context of private property, i.e., a subjective system of representation, and once again in the family, and that moreover, the determinations of the social field get applied to the determinations of the family.</p><p>In other words, if the axiomatics of capitalism fully emerged with the bourgeois political economy of the 19th century, psychoanalysis is its application, the necessary and inevitable application of such an axiomatic. Psychoanalysis is the application of the axiomatic corresponding to the political economy of capitalism. Which means that, in a sense—and this is where I’d like to stop—we can delineate three aspects I find most the most crucial when it comes to the idea of axiomatics:</p><p>The first is what’s radically distinct about axiomatics, since an axiomatic doesn’t work the same way code does. Why doesn’t it work like a code? Because codes refer labor and desire to underlying objectities, be it a territorial system, a despotic system… [<em>text missing</em>] whereas an axiomatic is a system of relations representing a subjective activity, a fundamentally deterritorialized activity. Which harks back to our hypothesis from the start of the year, that when flows are decoded—which is one of the processes of decoding—well, when flows are decoded, an axiomatic is substituted for a code; instead of a code, a system of differential relationships between decoded flows. So there’s something specific, something radically different about axiomatics in comparison to the process of code itself. And again, what I find so striking about what we today refer to as genetic code is—I think it can be demonstrated that it both has parts that are code-related as well as parts that are completely different, that are axiomatic. The concept of genetic code is totally mixed together, thus there’s a specificity to axiomatics. Which basically means yes, axiomatics describes subjective activity that’s revealed to be indeterminate, breaking with the big objectities that sought to code it.</p><p>At the same time, secondly, in a way, like a shadow theater, axiomatics returns us to everything codes had led us to believe. Only the way we come back to them is something different from belief. A mode of images where there’s no need to believe; who cares if you don’t believe in them? Regardless, that’s how it is. A very interesting sort of world that no longer needs belief but still requires lifeless images of whatever used to be believed. Nietzsche was the only one to profoundly see that, when he defined the man of… [<em>word missing</em>] as a “motley painting of everything that’s been believed,” the last of the popes. It doesn’t make any difference because it no longer needs to be addressed, no longer needs to be believed; it doesn’t need belief to function. It runs on images produced via an axiomatic of flows. Right, I said that axiomatics somehow brings everything back—why? Because, in the form of subjective representation, it brings us back to all the instances that were dethroned as objectities. The insistence of the great despot, which returns with Oedipus, and territorial insistence, which returns in every capitalist reterritorialization—which certainly isn’t the objectity of the earth as it appeared in territorial systems of alliance and descent but is the sort of artificial territoriality fundamental to the capitalist system.</p><p>And so, approaching it in the first way, which I talked about before, there’s absolutely something unique about axiomatics; in no way can it be confused for a code or coding process. Coming at it in the second way, I’d say the opposite, but it’s perfect, [it’s] the same way but without being unique, because it’s always getting torn between two poles: escape on one end, getting choked out on the other. With its escape, as we’ve seen from the very beginning, it’s that flows get decoded, completely deterritorialized. But axiomatics avoids that by establishing a whole system of enunciable relationships between coded flows, a new type of relationship, which is what axiomatics is all about, i.e., a system of differential relationships. Thus, at one end, you have its escape, but at the same time, it cuts things off—and how does it cut it off? Again, not by reverting to its prior code of objective representation, but by re-alienating, re-attaching, re-ligating anything that’s about to escape—by creating the ligatures again, this time at the level of subjective representation itself. And at the level of subjective representation, there will be an internalized despot, an internalized earth.</p><p>Which allows me to say that, on the one hand, axiomatics absolutely cannot be reduced to any code, to any code whatsoever, insofar as code, again, is what refers labor and desire to objectities. On the other hand, axiomatics lacks any specificity because it always oscillates between two poles, escaping at one end and, at the other end, resurrecting old bodies to counter its escape—this time not as a fictitious element, but as an element of subjective representation. Through this lens, it’s not contradictory to say that, simultaneously, there is both something absolutely specific to axiomatics and, at the same time, that it’s constantly torn between its two extremes, between a new way of resurrecting old instances and its escape.</p><p>And finally, as the third aspect of axiomatics, having described it in its specificity as well as its two poles, it absolutely needs—both with regard to its specificity and in order to avoid its tendency to escape—what it truly [needs] is to be applied. Insofar as it governs or expresses the laws of social production in the capitalist regime, it’s vitally necessary that it be applied to the form of human reproduction, in the form of the family. In other words, I don’t think it’s any coincidence that political economy, defined as the science of economics under capitalism, requires an exercise in its application, a sort of accessory—psychoanalysis, in particular, as its application. As an application, the trajectory psychoanalysis follows is that whereby the entire form of social reproduction is reduced onto [<em>se rabat sur</em>] the form of the family’s reproduction, and it’s only by way of this application that capitalist axiomatics effectively cuts off, is able to stifle the tendency of flows to get away or escape.</p><p>Until the day when—and this here is what I’d like to end on—until the day when, assuming that it’s a market, things stop working.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-09-7/#_edn6 rel=noopener>6</a> No one believes in it anymore. Or this sort of implementation loses its grip, can no longer hold onto its flows. We’ve seen countless reasons why, that is, this sort of re-alienation of desire, applied using the coordinates of the family, no longer works. There’s a generation where the social field is no longer reflected onto that of the family—new men [<em>sic</em>].</p><p>What’s going on? I mean, in a way, it’s what psychoanalysis calls malaise. Only, for psychoanalysis, so-called malaise is when, however psychoanalysts refer to it—because it comes in extremely different shades—and say it isn’t even worth trying to figure out what’s behind it because, strictly speaking, there isn’t anything behind it at all. [Serge] Leclaire’s <em>Démasquer le réel</em> [Unmasking the Real]: enough is enough—psychoanalysis should be its own axiomatic. Leclaire’s book strikes me as rather characteristic in this regard, when he says, alright, there’s an uneasiness or malaise in psychoanalysis at the moment [which] cannot be divorced from a process of decentering occurring in the field psychoanalysis operates in. This decentering, he claims, is a genuine shift from the “parent’s room” to the “analyst’s office,” i.e., the psychoanalytic process, strictly speaking, doesn’t require an “intrinsic referent,” as though the parent’s room were still too external. There’s something even worse than the analyst’s office—the (windowless) waiting room.</p><p>Now, what I find interesting about an idea like Leclaire’s is that both aspects are there. I mean, there’s the idea that psychoanalysis ought to pin down the real, to win back the real, to put psychoanalysis back in touch with the real, while at the same time, the approach is to make it so that psychoanalysis is no longer a mere inculcation of a different kind of axiomatic, the capitalist axiomatic of the social field. And he concludes that it should become its own axiomatic. In other words, what happens in the analyst’s office, as Leclaire explains, doesn’t need to refer to anything outside of the office itself, what so-called rationalist philosophers have long described as <em>verum index sui</em>—that truth is its own sign, that it doesn’t refer to anything other than itself, and that it can be made out using its own outward characteristics. Which means that castration, Oedipus, and the like, are proven in the psychoanalytic process itself, having a place in none other than the analyst’s office. Having left the parents’ bedroom behind, psychoanalysis ceases to be the application of some other type of axiomatic in order to stand on its own as a true axiomatic. Now, I think this gesture is something of an achievement; psychoanalysis severed its ties with political economy in order to itself become political economy… [<em>End of Part I</em>]</p><p><strong>Part II</strong>: <strong>The Body without Organs</strong></p><p>An axiom is an event’s forward momentum. I’d like to try to do a bit of pop philosophy, pop analysis. The body without organs is effectively an intensive matrix. And if it seems like it’s totally closed off, that’s because we can’t look in extension for its potential dynamism. I’m not even sure whether there is any dynamism, but if there is, it isn’t in extension. It’s sewn shut, closed off, it’s without organs. At the same time, something happens upon it. It’s like a surface; there’s something courses over it—a flow, let’s say. Let’s say it’s traversed by an intensive flow, and that it reacts to fluctuations in this flow.</p><p>Fluctuations in this flow over the body without organs—which already implicates what I’ve been looking for since last year, which I haven’t made much progress on, since you aren’t helping me. You might say that that already entails the sort of perspective we’re trying to find in all these aspects of delirium, since delirium is what I’m interested in. For me, thought is delirium—it’s the same thing. But precisely what it means to be delirious—and this has been my claim from the start—is to cross thresholds of intensity, to pass the threshold between one intensity and another. In other words, before being delirious, someone with delusions is someone who feels, and to feel means sensing intensive transitions in one’s body without organs. Let’s consider the example of Judge Schreber: no larynx, his stomach eaten away, a body without organs—and on his body without organs, he feels that he’s becoming a woman, he’s crossing into a flow… [<em>text missing</em>]</p><p>We’ve come to a domain of purely sensible experimentation, and I’m thinking of three bodies, or four—the masochist, schizophrenic, addicted, hysterical—they’re so many approximations for the limit of the body without organs, a pure limit each of them is distinguished from. And yet, they all tend towards one same limit. How are they all distinct from each other? Here, it might be helpful for us to get into what happens with intensity. It’s true that, ultimately, the masochistic body is touched; I’m not saying that that’s what it’s looking for, but anything inscribed upon it should be informed by a flow or an intensity of pain. I’m referring to so-called erogenous masochists—what runs along their body without organs is only collected according to some intensity or other, either a decrease or increase in an intensity of pain. It’s what you might call writing on their body without organs, and if it isn’t pain—whether less or more—their body without organs doesn’t register it.</p><p>The drug addict, at least in some cases—and once again we have to know a little pharmacy, and I’ve been saying all along, pharmacy and psychiatry have it wrong—it supports a fundamental pharmaceutical experiment. The drugged body—with opium and opiates, at least—when it comes to drugs, the body without organs [is] a kind of full body; the body is so organ-less that the guy doesn’t even know how to inject his stuff. With this body, it situates itself based on a flow of intensity running throughout the drug experience. Which means that, as much for delirium as for hallucinating on drugs, it becomes necessary to re-establish—just like with schizophrenia, with Schreber—an “I feel” that’s deeper than delirium, an “I feel” deeper than hallucination. Prior to saying “I’m becoming a woman,” prior to the delusion of becoming-woman, Schreber <em>feels</em> that he’s becoming a woman, and he’s becoming-woman in intensity.</p><p>What does that mean? Well, the drug addict isn’t like the masochist, [where] things happen on their body without organs based on a flow of pain that fluctuates in intensity, as if nothing stuck to the body without organs, in the case of the masochist, if it didn’t capture the point where something running through the body without organs, which can only rouse it through pain, in the form of a fluctuating flow of pain. With the drug addict, it isn’t about pain; it’s about cold. The reason behind Americans’ reference to cold as zero degrees is precisely in order to indicate the limit of intensity, just like the schizo. I mentioned an intensity = 0, which will form the scale of intensity corresponding to the schizo’s delirium. Here, with the absolute zero cold on the body without organs, it’s as though, just like the masochist started with a flow of pain, now what distributes intensity is a flow of hold and cold. It’s no longer pain; what actually delineates zones of intensity is hot-and-cold, only a very particular cold and hot—an icy cold, sort of an absolute ice, an intensive ice, which the intensive metric for the drug experience itself is based on.</p><p>And in the case of schizophrenia, it’s something different again, and when it comes to hysteria, like we were just saying, is it possible to define a mimetic flow in intensity? Now our problem is starting to take shape, as to the status of this body without organs—as the metaphor I can’t get away from, at least—which makes me think it’s something more than a metaphor. It goes back to the basic stuff we learn from embryologists, again, about the egg: how they claim, uh, well, before it’s developed, there are dedicated parts of the egg—if nothing disturbs it, a certain region of the egg will generate a certain thing, e.g., generating the newt’s tail, the newt’s eye, the newt’s respiratory system.</p><p>But the egg really comes across as a body without organs, precisely because its organs are still no more than blueprints. It takes the sacred form of an egg, a form that negates the organ, that negates organs, that negates any organic growth. And it goes without saying that the region dedicated to generating the oral apparatus, or the ocular apparatus, or the neural tube—all these regions predetermined to generate this rather than that—none of them resemble the organ they will later incur. The region of the newt egg that generates the neural arch doesn’t resemble what it generates, and embryologists say, see, an egg is a closed circuit, but it’s completely gridded, shot through by extremely complex systems of coordinates.</p><p>We ought to interpret these coordinate systems in terms of intensity; in other words, in any given space there are axes, parallels—the egg has a whole topology to it. If you’re between such and such gradient of intensity, that’s the region that develops into such and such. If you get its regions out of order, it’s no surprise that the part that normally would have developed the newt’s tail ends up developing its neural plate… The whole egg is covered by a grid, but the grid is intensive, as if a flow… [<em>End of Part II</em>]</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p><a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-09-7/#_ednref1 rel=noopener>1</a> For Marx’s perspective on this, see <em>Anti-Oedipus</em>, pp. 302-303.

Photograph by Jean-Pierre Bamberger.</p><p><strong>Given the date attributed to this session by WebDeleuze, over a month separates it from the previous session. Commencing with a reference to Foucault regarding the emergence of statements over several domains at once, Deleuze seeks a different explanation for this emergence beyond those given by structuralists and Marxists, and he reviews in some detail various problems with a dualistic perspective, identifying psychoanalysis as the final inheritor of Cartesianism, thereby denying thought as a process which, for him, is fundamentally multiple. Deleuze emphasizes the importance of suppressing the one-multiple opposition, substituting the substantive “multiplicities” for the One, and he considers how the history of desire has been ruined in this regard by viewing desire as lack, the first malediction of desire, the second and third being desire as satisfied by pleasure or related to jouissance. Deleuze considers how this corrupt perspective emerges in Freud and also where Reich goes wrong, with whom he contrasts Barthes’s perspectives in <em>The Pleasure of the Text</em>’s distinction of texts of pleasure and texts of jouissance.</strong> He argues that a perspective of process, through which desire emerges out of its own immanence and productivity, stands in sharp contrast with the Freudian and Lacanian view of lack-pleasure-jouissance, posing the dualism between subject of enunciation and the subject of the statement. To a student’s comment that his distinctions are similar to previous dualisms (e.g. the mass versus the pack), Deleuze insists that he reintroduces no dualisms here and argues that there is no reality to thought except in the monism of the process and in the multiplicities that populate the field of immanence. After a session break, Deleuze returns to the Western view of desire as a sign of lack (the first malediction), the second being recourse to an illusion of pleasure, the third being the impossible jouissance-death relationship. In contrast to this, Deleuze posits the production of statements through collective agents of enunciation (and not individuals), i.e. multiplicities of varied nature, and such statements are desires, accompanied by the illusion of the split subject being engendered. Deleuze imagines a graph with two columns: the first is “the bad column” of the false conception of desire, whereas in the other column is the anti-Oedipal apparatus which he outlines. At what machinic point, Deleuze asks, is the maximum of deterritorialization on the body without organs reached? He leaves this project in suspense, but suggests that for the next session, Carlos Castaneda’s books (<em>The Teachings of Don Juan</em> and <em>A Separate Reality</em> are the likely sources) provide a view of experimentation in search of a body without organs within a machinic assemblage with a certain distribution of intensities.</p><p><strong>Dualism, Monism and Multiplicities; Desire-Pleasure-Jouissance</strong></p><p>In the <em>Archaeology of Knowledge</em>, Foucault said some profound things about statements [énoncés] that concern several domains at once, even if not at the same time. I take two very vague examples. There is a moment in the Greek City when statements of a new type emerge, and these statements of a new type emerge within assignable temporal arrangements, in several domains. They can be statements concerning love, concerning marriage, concerning war, yet we feel that there is a kind of kinship or community among these statements. We have seen certain thinkers try to give explanations of how statements emerge in diverse domains that have this kind of kinship. In Greece, for example, during the “hoplite” reform, new types of statements concerning war and strategy emerge, but also new statements concerning marriage and politics. All this, it has been said, cannot be unrelated.</p><p>There are some people who immediately say, for example, that there is a system of analogies or a system of homologies, and that perhaps all these statements refer to a common structure. They are called: structuralists. Others will say that these productions of statements depend on a certain domain which is determinative in relation to the others. Such people, for example, we will call: Marxists. Perhaps it would be better to look for something else.</p><p>There’s a book from which one can learn many things, titled <em>Sexual Life in Ancient China</em> [by Robert H. van Gulik (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1961)]. This book shows clearly that manuals of love and manuals of military strategy are indiscernible, and that new strategic and military statements are produced at the same time as new amorous statements. That’s curious. I ask myself: OK, how can we extract ourselves, at the same time, from a structuralist vision that seeks correspondences, analogies, and homologies, and from a Marxist vision that seeks determinants. I indeed see one possible hypothesis, but it’s so confused . . . It’s perfect. It would consist in saying: at a given moment, for reasons that, of course, must still be determined, it is as if a social space were covered by what we would have to call an abstract machine. We would have to give a name to this non-qualified abstract machine, a name that would mark its absence of qualification, so that everything will be clear. We could call it — at the same time, this abstract machine, at a given moment, will break with the abstract machine of the preceding epochs — in other words, it will always be at the cutting edge [à la pointe], thus it would receive the name machinic point [pointe machinique]. It would be the machinic point of a group or a given collectivity; it would indicate, within a group and at a given moment, the maximum of deterritorialization as well as, and at the same time, its power of innovation. This is somewhat abstract at the moment, it’s like algebra. It’s this abstract machine which, in conditions that will have to be determined, it’s this machinic point of deterritorialization that is reterritorialized in this or that machine, or in this or that military machine, amorous machine, productive of new statements. This is a possible hypothesis.</p><p>I have the impression that there are things in [André] Leroi-Gourhan we could use here, we would have to see how that works. This machinic point would indicate a kind of speed of deterritorialization. There are systems of indices under which reterritorializations are made in qualified machines, war machines, machines of love, machines of marriage.</p><p><strong>Kyril Rejik:</strong> This is your “series” [enfilades] which are taken up again in networks?</p><p><strong>Deleuze:</strong> Ah, no, that’s something else. As you sense, at bottom this is not our hypothesis. That’s because in this problem of where statements come from, what their production is related to, the sub-jacent response will consist in answering: there are no individual statements, and this is one of the multiple traps of psychoanalysis, which is the successor of a type of thinking which we could call Western thought and which says that there are individual statements. And finally, the form or logic of individual statements has been fixed by the cogito. It has been fixed by the cogito which comprehends the production of statements from the subject, from a subject. Cogito: this means that every statement is the production of a subject. It means that first; and second, it means that every statement splits the subject that produces it. Lacan is the last Cartesian. Then every statement refers to a subject, and every statement splits, cuts, separates the subject that produces it. These are propositions that are linked up naturally, because if it is true that a statement is produced by a subject, then for that very reason, this subject will be divided into the subject of enunciation and the subject of the statement. This is what the literal process [démarche] of the cogito consists of.</p><p>The process of the cogito, you recall, is: I can say “I think, therefore I am,” but I can’t say “I walk, therefore I am.” Descartes explains this in his Responses to Objections, in Descartes’s rare comic pages. Someone has objected, “Why don’t you say ‘I walk’ like ‘I am’?” and he says, “I can’t.” That amounts to saying that “I walk” is a subject of the statement, whereas “I think” is the subject of enunciation. [<em>In this regard, see</em> A Thousand Plateaus, <em>p. 128</em>]</p><p>Then, perhaps I’m not walking, but there’s one thing I’m sure of, and that is that I’m thinking of walking. In other words, the subject cannot produce a statement without being thereby split [scindé] by the statement into a subject of enunciation and a subject of the statement. This introduces the entire metaphysics of the subject into psychoanalysis. If we look closely at the cogito. . .</p><p><strong>A student:</strong> But there is no alterity in Descartes.</p><p><strong>Deleuze:</strong> What is it that you are looking for? And dualism! There is a dualism at the level of thought and the object thought. There is a dualism at the level of soul and body, there are as many dualisms as you like. And if we ask: What is the source of all the Cartesian dualisms? — it lies in this scission internal to the subject, between the subjects of the statement, which allow no conclusion, and a subject of enunciation, which is subtracted from doubt: “I think.”</p><p>In the entire series of Cartesian dualisms (soul-body, thought-extension, statement-enunciation), the only remark and the only question is that this isn’t the final aspect. The duality of subjects of the statement and subjects of enunciation — once again, the subjects of statements of the type “I am walking,” “I am breathing,” “I imagine,” and the subjects of enunciation “I think” — Is it not this duality that will inhabit all the dualisms of reflection and all the other dualisms of substances, bodies, etc.?</p><p>I take up again, I’m thinking of the text where Descartes says, it may be — I see a unicorn, or I imagine a unicorn — it may indeed be that the unicorn does not exist, it may very well be that the proposition, that the statement “I see a unicorn” is false. But in return, it’s true that I think I am seeing a unicorn. At this level, a kind of disengagement of a subject of enunciation occurs, and thereby all the subjects of possible statements. Whence he will say to you: I cannot say “I walk, therefore I am,” for from a subject of the statement, I cannot conclude a being of enunciation, or the being of a subject of enunciation; but I can say “I think, therefore I am,” because from a subject of enunciation I can conclude the being of this subject.</p><p>Now all the dualisms of Descartes, even passion and action, depend strictly on this operation of the cogito, which consists of relating statements to a subject of enunciation, which will consequently split the subject in two: the subject of the statement, and the subject of enunciation. This will be found, for example, at the Cartesian level, in the subject of the statement, which in the end refers to the union of the soul with the body, and the subject of enunciation, which refers to the thinking subject. When I say that, in a certain manner, psychoanalysis is the final inheritor of Cartesianism, it is because, even looking at the cogito, it is very curious at what point it is an Oedipal apparatus, a sublimated Oedipal apparatus. [<em>On Descartes and the cogito, see</em> A Thousand Plateaus, <em>pp. 128-129</em>]</p><p>It could very well be that I myself, as a living being, have been made by my father and my mother. But the fact that I think, that isn’t explained by my father and mother, that’s explained by what? If we consider the cogito as a machine, we can see three great moments in it: doubt–which is typically a type of paranoiac machine; the non-deceiving God is a miraculating [trans: reading “miraculante” for “déraillante”] machine, and the “I think” is a celibate machine. That is the Oedipal space of pure thought. There are Oedipuses everywhere; there are not only familial Oedipuses, there are also scientific Oedipuses; and the philosophical Oedipus is the cogito, it is the Oedipal machine at the level of thought. This is what one calls dualism. Dualism is what prevents thought. Dualism always wants to deny the essence of thought, namely, that thought is a process. And the source of dualism, it seems to me, is this type of reduction, this flattening of all statements of thought, precisely, by this speculative, Oedipal apparatus in which the statement, on the one hand, is related to the subject, to a subject, and on the other hand, and simultaneously, the subject is split into a subject of the statement and the subject of enunciation. In this perspective, the subject is rethought.</p><p>There is only one form of thought, it’s the same thing: one can only think in a monistic or pluralistic manner. The only enemy is two. Monism and pluralism: it’s the same thing, because, in a certain manner, it seems to me that every opposition, even all possibilities of oppositions between the one and the multiple . . . This is because the source of dualism is precisely the opposition between something that can be affirmed as one, and something that can be affirmed as multiple, and more precisely, what signals it as one is precisely the subject of enunciation, and what signals it as multiple is always the subject of the statement . . . [<em>On this same development of the “one” and the “multiple”, see</em> A Thousand Plateaus, <em>pp. 32-34</em>]</p><p>We saw last time how to bring about the suppression of the opposition between the one and the multiple. It happens the moment the one and the multiple cease to be adjectives and give way to the substantive: there are only multiplicities. That is to say, when the substantive “multiplicities” takes the place of the one, of the multiple and their … [<em>missing text, perhaps</em>: adjectives], and at this moment, one and multiple lose absolutely all meaning, at the same time as the subject of enunciation and the subject of the statement. There are multiplicities, which obviously implies a theory and practice of multiplicities. Wherever we leave the domain of multiplicities, we once again fall into dualisms, i.e., into the domain of non-thought, we leave the domain of thought as process.</p><p>Now to show at what point things become botched, I always think of this history of desire. What I have been saying since the beginning amounts to saying that thinking and desiring are the same thing. The best way to avoid seeing or to refuse to see that desire is thought, that the position of desire in thought is a veritable process, is obviously to link desire to lack. Once desire is linked to lack, one is immediately in the domain, one has already assumed the basis of dualism. But today I would like to say that there are more underhanded ways of reintroducing lack into desire, either through the Other, or through dualism. Here, so-called Western thought is constructed from the relation between desire and pleasure, a completely rotten [pourrie] conception.</p><p>The first malediction of desire, the first malediction that weighs on desire like a Christian curse, and goes back to the Greeks, is that desire is lack. The second malediction is: desire will be satisfied by pleasure, or will be in an enunciable relation with jouissance. Of course, there will be those who will tell us that these are not the same thing. Nonetheless, there is a peculiar circuit here: desire-pleasure-jouissance. And all that, once again, is a way of cursing and liquidating desire. [<em>For this same sequence of maledictions, see</em> A Thousand Plateaus, <em>p. 154</em>]</p><p>The idea of pleasure is a completely rotten [pourrie] idea. One only has to look at Freud’s texts, at the level of desire-pleasure, which amount to saying that desire is above all a disagreeable tension. There are one or two texts where Freud says that, after all, perhaps there are agreeable tensions, but again that doesn’t take us very far. Broadly speaking, desire is lived as such a disagreeable tension that — a horrible, hideous word is required here, that’s how bad this thing is — a discharge is necessary. And this discharge, this is what pleasure is! People will have peace, and then, alas! desire is reborn, a new discharge will be necessary. The types of conceptions that are called, in scholarly terms, hedonistic, namely, the search for pleasure, and the types of mystical conceptions that curse desire, by virtue of what is fundamental in lack — I would simply like you to sense that, in any case, they both consider desire to be a dirty little thing that wakes us up, and that wakes us up in the most disagreeable manner: either by putting us in relation with a fundamental lack, which can then be assuaged by a kind of activity of discharge, and then one will have peace, and then it will all begin over again . . . . When one introduces the notion of jouissance into all that — you can see I’m in the process of trying to make a circle, very muddled, a pious circle, a religious circle of the theory of desire — we can see to what an extent psychoanalysis is impregnated, and how great the psychoanalytic piety is. This circle, one of its segments is desire-lack, another segment is pleasure-discharge, and once again, they are completely linked.</p><p>And then I ask myself: What’s wrong with Reich? There are two great errors in Reich: the first error is dualism, then he passes to the side: it’s the dualism between two economies, between a political economy and a libidinal economy. If one speaks of a duality between two economies, one will always be able to promise to make the connection [branchement], but the connection will never be made. And this error of dualism has a repercussion at another level: desire is still thought of as a lack, and thus it is still thought with pleasure, as its unit of measure. And Reich has indeed given the word pleasure a stronger and more violent word, he calls it orgasm. His entire conception of the orgasm, which he will try to turn against Freud, consists in pushing desire to the limit insofar as it is linked to lack. If it cannot manage to obtain the discharge that assuages it, it will produce what Reich calls stasis. Desire is fundamentally related to the orgasm, and in order to relate desire to pleasure or to the orgasm, one must relate it to lack. It is exactly the same thing. The first proposition is the inverse of the second.</p><p>If we add the third arc of the circle: desire-lack, all that always concerns desire which is directed toward transcendence. In effect, if desire lacks something, it is like intentionality aiming at what it lacks, it is defined as a function of transcendence, in the same way that is it measured as a function of a unit that is not its own, which will be pleasure or the orgasm, which assures its discharge. And, in order to close the circle, which for the moment has only two arcs — obviously, the theme that consists in establishing a distinction between jouissance and pleasure is very useful. This is what will make the whole thing function together. I am thinking notably of a distinction dear to Lacan, but I’m not familiar with it, the distinction between jouissance and pleasure.</p><p>I recall what Barthes said about it in his last book, <em>The Pleasure of the Text</em> [<em>Paris: Seuil, 1973</em>] where he explains it a little. He distinguishes texts of pleasure and texts of jouissance. This is what he says about texts of pleasure: “the text that contents, fills, grants euphoria; the text that comes from culture and does not break with it, is linked to a comfortable practice of reading. Text of jouissance: the text that imposes a state of loss, the text that discomforts, … unsettles the reader’s historical, cultural, psychological assumptions, the consistency of his tastes, values, memories… Now the subject who keeps the two texts in his field and in his hands the reins of pleasure and jouissance is an anachronic subject, for he simultaneously and contradictorily participates in the profound hedonism of all culture … and in the destruction of that culture: he enjoys the consistency of his selfhood (that is his pleasure) and seeks its loss” — the loss of self –“(that is his bliss [<em>jouissance</em>]). He is a subject split twice over, doubly perverse.” [Barthes, <em>The</em> <em>Pleasure of the Text</em> (Hill & Wang, 1975, trans. Richard Miller, p.14; trans. modified]</p><p>Incredible. We here recover the duality of the subject of the statement, capable of pleasure, and the subject of enunciation, deserving of jouissance. Only, just as the subject of the statement never raises itself to the subject of enunciation, because the subject of enunciation is finally the great signifier, it goes without saying that jouissance is impossible. This means, as Barthes is in the process of explaining, that jouissance is in a fundamental relationship with death, so that we can close our circle: desire-lack, desire-pleasure or orgasm, desire jouissance.</p><p>Happily, in an even clearer text, Barthes goes so far as to say: “Is pleasure only a minor bliss? Is bliss nothing but extreme pleasure?” No. It’s not that one is stronger than the other, or the other less strong; they differ in nature. If one says that pleasure and <em>jouissance</em> are “parallel forces, that they cannot meet, and that between them is more than a struggle: an incommunication, then I must certainly believe that history, our history, is not peacable and perhaps not even intelligent, that the text of bliss always rises out of it like a scandal (an irregularity), that it is always the trace of a cut, of an assertion…” [Barthes, <em>Pleasure</em>, p.20, trans. modified]. We could go on. . . .  What’s happening here?</p><p>I’m thinking of this book on sexual life in ancient China. It recounts a strange story, in the end we are all Chinese: in Taoism, it varies throughout the ages, in any case, the reader is struck by the glory of the men and women in it. . . . But that’s not what marks its difference from Western thought, because, from the side of Western thought, that doesn’t work more strongly; the difference is elsewhere.</p><p>What’s different is the way desire is experienced in a totally different manner: it’s not related to any transcendence, it’s not related to any lack, it’s not measured by any pleasure, and it’s not transcended by any jouissance, under the form or myth of the impossible. Desire is posited as a pure process. Concretely, this means that it is not at all the orgasm; their problem is not at all the Western problem, which is: How to extract sexuality from genitality. Their problem is: How to extract sexuality from the orgasm? Then, broadly speaking, they say: You understand, pleasure or orgasm, that’s not the achievement of the process, it is either its interruption or its exasperation, or the two amount to the same thing, and it’s completely deplorable! No doubt, that has to happen, but then one has to perceive these moments of suspension as veritable suspensions that allow the process to once again be set in motion. They have a theory of female energy and male energy, which consists in saying, broadly: female energy is inexhaustible, male energy, it’s more annoying, it’s exhaustible. The problem, in any case, is that the man takes something from the female energy which is inexhaustible, or that each takes something from the other. How can that be done?</p><p>Flows are necessary — and indeed this is a thought in terms of flows — the feminine flow, following very determined trajectories, rises up following the lines of masculine flow, along the spinal column, to go to the brain, and that’s desire in its immanence as a process. One borrows a flow, one absorbs a flow, one defines a pure field of immanence of desire, in relation to which pleasure, orgasm, jouissance are defined as veritable suspensions or interruptions. That is, not as the satisfaction of desire, but as the contrary: an exasperation of the process that makes desire come out of its own immanence, i.e., its own productivity. All this is interesting for us, to the degree that, in this thought, desire simultaneously loses any link with lack, with pleasure or orgasm, or with jouissance. It is conceived as the production of a flow, it defines a field of immanence, and a field of immanence–that means a multiplicity in which, effectively, any splitting of the subject into a subject of enunciation and a subject of the statement becomes strictly impossible, since in our revolving machine it was very simple: the subject of enunciation was the subject of impossible jouissance, the subject of the statement was the subject of pleasure and of the search for pleasure, and desire-lack was the splitting of the two. That should tell you to what degree, from Descartes to Lacan, this repugnant thought of the cogito is not only a metaphysical thought.</p><p>The entire history of desire — and once again, Reich falls in the same way — this way of linking desire to a beyond, whether it’s that of lack, or pleasure, or jouissance, and of posing the dualism between the subject of enunciation and the subject of the statement. And it isn’t by chance that it’s the same people who are doing it today, i.e., the Lacanians, i.e., engendering all statements from the subject, which consequently, and retroactively, becomes the subject split into the subject of enunciation and the subject of the statement. What is inscribed is the subject of enunciation, which links desire with the impossible jouissance; the subject of the statement, which links desire with pleasure; and the cleavage of the two subjects, which links desire with lack or castration. And at the level of theory, the production of statements exactly covers this rotten theory of desire, word for word.</p><p>It is in this sense that I’m saying that thought is indeed monist, in the very apprehension of the identity of thought and process; as well as in the apprehension of the identity of process and desire: desire as constitutive of its own field of immanence, that is, as constitutive of the multiplicities that populate it. But all this is perhaps obscure, a monistic field is indeed a field inhabited by multiplicities.</p><p><strong>Rejik:</strong> Yes, but I find that dangerous, because monism is considered to be something completely different, like the result of a dialectic coming from dualism. Hegel, for example.</p><p><strong>Deleuze:</strong> But that’s a false monism.</p><p>This magical operation that consists in forbidding the employment of the adjectives one and multiple, in order to retain only the substantive multiplicities. . . . This is the operation that gives an account of the identity of monism and pluralism, and which related the true source of dualism to the duality established between the two adjectives: the one and the multiple. The ground of dualism has always been: there are things that are one. Here one always recovers Descartes, because today we are talking about Descartes, i.e., Lacan. And then there are things that are divisible. Dualism is not defined by two, dualism is defined by the employment of the one and the multiple as adjectives. This is already true in Duns Scotus.</p><p>So that, instead of using the one and the multiple as adjectives, one substitutes the substantive multiplicities in the form: there is nothing that is one, there is nothing that is multiple, everything is multiplicities. At this moment, one can see the strict identity of monism and pluralism in this form of a process of immanence which can be neither interested — and this is what the Chinese tell us in their sexual wisdom — nor exasperated. The process of immanence is also a multiplicity, i.e., to design a field of immanence populated by a multiplicity.</p><p><strong>Rejik:</strong> A minute ago, you spoke a dualism as a result of Oedipus. Since, on the other hand, you think of Oedipus as a transitory machine between the affairs of the mass, the pack, or the affairs of paranoia or schizophrenia, you thus have a production of this dualism from a dualism that is proper to you (you don’t return like that) at the level of the functioning of this process. This is what you have been explaining for two or three years.</p><p><strong>Deleuze:</strong> That has been over for two or three years, it’s finished. Here, today, I am reintroducing no dualism. Forget the rest.</p><p>When I say: the cogito is Oedipal, it matters little. . . . It would be necessary to find, moreover. . . . The first formulations of the cogito must be in Sophocles’ <em>Oedipus</em>, even in the Cartesian texts, this entire progression is there, the assimilation to the three stages of the Oedipal machine, with paranoiac doubt, the non-deceiving, miraculating God, and the “I think.” That appears to me to be almost [<em>missing phrase</em>] that is, what I mean is that any theory which, in one way or another, relates the production of statements to a subject is firstly a theory that will necessarily divide the subject in two: the subject of the statement and the subject of enunciation. Secondly, it will involve us in all sorts of submissions, by telling us, in the most hypocritical manner, that you’re the boss! What I would like to make clear is this is all the same thing. And thirdly, the figures of desire, in the sense that desire is linked to lack, or, what amounts to the same thing, desire is linked to the trinity pleasure-orgasm-jouissance. Voilà.</p><p>Why this second point? Why this most hypocritical submission? It is because this history of the splitting of the subject always consists in saying: it is you who command, i.e., you will accede to the commandment to the degree that you submit yourself to a order, which you are not subject to without also being its legislator. This is the famous order of democracy. You are a legislator insofar as you are a subject; and it is not by chance that the person who pushed this doctrine the farthest, the formalism of this doctrine, is the inheritor of Descartes from the viewpoint of the cogito, namely, Kant, and that the submission to reason is presented to us as the manner in which we become legislators. This always refers us to the division of the subject into a subject of the statement and a subject of enunciation: you will obey as the subject of the statement, but because it is you who command as the subject of enunciation, and we are led to grasp this great split identity — as a barred identity, whatever you like — between the legislator and the subject. It’s the same thing; it’s the same mechanism, which thereby claims to engender statements in relation to a subject; which posits the duality of a subject of enunciation and a subject of the statement as the source of all the other dualisms, which thus suppresses thought as a process; and which, thirdly, destroys any position of desire, because by relating desire to lack, pleasure, and jouissance, it in effect leaps in favor of the appearance of thought, i.e., in favor of an image of thought. We could contemplate the image of thought in dualism, whereas there is no reality to thought except in the monism of the process and in the multiplicities that populate the field of immanence.</p><p>So that when the Chinese define this field of immanence of desire traversed by flows — which pursue neither the possible pleasure at the level of the subject of the statement, nor the impossible jouissance at the level of a pseudo-subject of enunciation — at the same time, they give themselves all the conditions for an entire theory of desire and a theory of the production of statements.</p><p>A final step to take: Why do they look for the theory of the production of statements in a military art, that is, in a war machine, a strategic war machine, while at the same time looking for the theory of desire in manuals of sexuality? The two types of manuals are strictly [<em>missing word</em>] with each other. Which is to say that they define multiplicities communicating within the process, or within the field of immanence itself.</p><p><strong>Rejik:</strong> With this little difference, that the manuals of sexology are completely phallocratic and Chinese politics is completely imperial.</p><p><strong>Deleuze:</strong> OK, but that’s a detail, because that’s not what makes the difference between the East and the West. You could say the same thing about the West; if you’re looking for the difference, it’s certainly not there. That it’s phallocratic and imperial, OK, but that’s more the common background. What this means is that it’s not enough to define desire as a field of immanence in order to escape imperialism, etc.</p><p>Is this clear, this relation between the theory of statements and the conception of desire? [<em>Pause in the session</em>]</p><p>No one can say anything about the difference in Lacan between pleasure and jouissance?</p><p><strong>A student:</strong> Desire entails an enunciable relation with jouissance.</p><p><strong>Deleuze:</strong> We can see how this all takes part in the same thing. To say that jouissance is not pleasure, that it takes part in a kind of system, which, in order to simplify it, I would present as a circular conception of desire in which, at the bottom, there is always the same starting postulate — and it is true that Western philosophy has always consisted in saying: if desire exists, it is the very sign, or the very fact, that you are lacking something.</p><p>Everything starts from that. A first welding of desire-lack is brought about; from there, it goes without saying that desire is defined as a function of a field of transcendence; desire is desire for what one does not have; that begins with Plato, it continues with Lacan. This is the first malediction of desire, it’s the first way to curse desire; but it is not sufficient. — What I’m doing is following Plato’s method in the Phaedo, when he constructs a circle from arcs. —</p><p>The second arc: if desire is fundamentally aimed at an Other, open to a transcendence, if it is subjected to this first malediction, what is it that can come to fulfil it? What can fulfil it will never be the object toward which it tends, except in appearance, for it is the Other, it is unattainable, is the pure transcendent. Thus, that can’t be what fulfils it. What comes to fulfil it or satisfy it, what gives it a pseudo-immanence, will be what is called a state of pleasure. But at this second level, it’s understood that this immanence is a false immanence, since desire has been fundamentally defined in relation to a transcendence, and this fulfilment is, literally, an illusion. Second malediction of desire: it’s a matter of calming desire for a moment, and then the malediction will begin again. And then it will be necessary to call it up again, and then it’s the conception of pleasure-discharge. This word is enough to indicate that the title of this second arc of the circle is “To Provisionally Have Done With Desire.” This is what’s fascinating to me: the point at which all this is retained in Reich’s protest against Freud. He retains this conception of desire-discharge, which he thematizes in the theory of the orgasm. This second arc clearly defines this type of illusory immanence through which pleasure fulfils desire, that is to say, it obliterates it for a while. But, as in any good construction — because all this is a pure construction — it’s not true, it’s false from start to finish.</p><p>A third arc is needed to close the circle, since you have this supposed truth of desire linked with a transcendence of the Other, this illusion or this deception through which desire encounters calming discharges in which it disappears, even if it reappears the next day. A third arc is needed to give an account of this: that even through these states of sleep, satisfaction, etc., the irreducibility of desire to states of pleasure, which only satisfy it in appearance, must be reaffirmed, it must be reaffirmed in another mode: transcendence. And this reaffirmation is the impossible jouissance-death relation. And from start to finish, it is the same conception. And when someone tells us: watch out, don’t confuse desire, pleasure, jouissance, obviously we shouldn’t confuse them because we need them to make the three arcs of the same circle, namely, the three arcs that bear down on desire.</p><p>The three maledictions are: You will lack every time you desire; you will only hope for discharges; you will pursue the impossible jouissance. Desire is thus completely ensnared, it is taken up in a circle.</p><p>How then is the problem of statements the same thing? It’s the same at the level of the Cartesian cogito, since you also construct your circle at the level of I walk, I breathe, I imagine, I see a unicorn, a system of statements in which the I [je] is the subject of the statement, and that is something like the appearance. Perhaps it’s not true, perhaps God is deceiving me, perhaps I believe I’m walking but I’m not walking. Second arc: but watch out, for if it’s true that I can be deceived when I say I’m walking, in return I cannot deceive myself when I say “I think I’m walking.” If it is true that I can be deceived when I say “I see a unicorn,” I cannot be deceived when I say “I think I’m seeing a unicorn.” That’s the extraction of the “I think, therefore I am,” it’s the extraction of the subject of enunciation; and the production of the statement, of any statement, is made in the form of a splitting of the subject into the subject of enunciation and the subject of the statement, as the condition of the production of any possible statement.</p><p>Desire-lack is found at the level of the splitting of the subject, of the cut, the bar. The desire-pleasure system is found at the level of the subject of the statement. And the desire-jouissance system is found at the level of the glory of the subject of enunciation, once again with the mystification of the circle: you will command all the more insofar as you obey, i.e., you will be all the more ready to be a true subject of enunciation insofar as you conform yourself to the bar that separates you as a subject of the statement from the subject of enunciation. In other words, it’s through castration that you accede to desire. To say: it’s through castration that you accede to desire, or to say: it’s through the splitting of the subject that you accede to the production of statements, is the same thing.</p><p><strong>Rejik:</strong> You don’t want to go further with Descartes’ God and Lacan’s signifier?</p><p><strong>Deleuze:</strong> I don’t want to, but I will, ouaf! ouaf! ouaf!</p><p>The problem becomes: supposing we say that only statements. . . that’s desire. Every desire is a statement, all statements are desires. If things are indeed like that, what we must give an account of is the system of appearance; then it goes without saying that Nietzsche was completely right, it’s truly a Platonic Christian system. And if that leads to psychoanalysis, it’s not by chance, because psychoanalysis is the thing that says to us, “Come here, lie down, you’re finally going to be able to speak in your name,” and which, at the same time, withdraws in advance all possible conditions for the production of statements, precisely because it has subordinated all production of statements to the splitting of the subject of enunciation and the subject of the statement, i.e., you will command all the more insofar as you accept castration and you pursue the impossible jouissance.</p><p><strong>Richard III:</strong> It seems to me that desire-discharge is taken up again in Lacan in the form of metonymy, it’s not far — but this is only an intuition — from desire — <em>aufhebung</em>, and that finally the entire history of desire which is displaced, and which one never manages to get to, is the trajectory of the Phenomenology of Spirit, broadly speaking. With precisely this jouissance, as an impossible horizon, which would be absolute knowledge.</p><p><strong>Gilles Deleuze:</strong> If you like, but there is no reason to privilege Hegel, because he is one of the multiple cases where desire is defined as lack, but in the pages just before those on the master and slave, everything passes through this circle: desire-lack, the illusion of pleasure, and desire-jouissance.</p><p><strong>Richard III:</strong> What’s really interesting is that if you tie desire to the field of the Other and to the treasure of the signifier, you truly have the process of <em>Erinnerung</em>. . .</p><p><strong>Gilles Deleuze:</strong> Yes, it’s not by chance that Lacan passed through Hegel; he has suppressed his Hegelian texts . . .</p><p>The problem is that it will be necessary to explain the formation of this appearance: Under what conditions do statements appear to be produced by a subject which, as the producer of statements, would then necessarily be split into a subject of the statement and the subject of enunciation. And above all, what does that permit as a falling-back [rabattement]? These are things we have already done, you have two possible fallings-back: either the subject of enunciation — in any case, the splitting makes them fall back on each other — either the subject of enunciation will fall back on the subject of the statement, and that will be the Oedipal apparatus, or else the subject of the statement will be granted to the subject of enunciation, and that will be the paranoiac apparatus. The paranoiac is the subject of the statement that takes itself to be the subject of enunciation.</p><p>I fear that there is no explanation that will make the formula any less dismal. The paranoiac is truly someone who establishes himself between everything that can be used as a sign in a network, or a system of networks, such that the sign refers to another sign. The sign no longer refers either to the earth, or to a body, or to a thing, the sign refers to another sign in a system of networks. Consequently, and at the same time, it is subsumed under a signifier. And this signifier is what represents it for another signifier, the subject, following a well-known formula, namely: the signifier is precisely the subject of enunciation. And the position of the paranoiac is very typical and very formidable, because he is both the person who doubts the most and the person who has the greatest power. Paranoia swarms in every direction: a sign here, oh, here’s another one, oh, but over there, etc. It’s not like that in all deliriums. Once again, a paranoiac is networks, and when he is taken in the networks, he doubts everything, he says to himself: perhaps I’m being deceived. As a subject of the statement, he is perpetually in a kind of doubt, but at the same time, he recuperates everything, and he recuperates a certitude, he is the distributor of signs, he is powerful and omnipotent to the degree that he leaps, he is unstable, at the level of the subject of enunciation, and the formula of the paranoiac is at the level: I have guessed in advance. He passes his time oscillating inside his network of signs.</p><p>It will be necessary to give an account of this production of an appearance. Once again, the appearance consists in this: statements would be produced by a subject thus split. How was this thing here able to produce that thing there? And this is the problem: How to say “me” [moi]? How to dare to say “me”? As soon as I say “me,” I situate myself both as a subject of the statement and a subject of enunciation. And whenever there is this cleavage, there’s all this rubbish [saloperie] that comes along with it. I mean, for example: “Me as a human being.” All social functions are constructed on that, all repressive functions are constructed on this cleavage: me as human being, you understand, but as a father, I must act! Me as human being, I’m on you side; but as a cop, I have to apply the law! As a cop, I have to apply the law, which means that I’m the subject of the statement. As a man, I understand you: that means I’m the subject of enunciation. I will be a legislator all the more insofar as I am a subject, you will be a subject all the more insofar as you are legislators, we all understand each other. . . . This is a way of saying: OK, we are all castrated, it works.</p><p>What we were saying last week was: there are no individual statements, no statement can be produced by an individual. Our hypothesis was that what produces statements were machinic assemblages, or what amounts to the same thing, collective agents of enunciation — on the condition that we understand that collective does not mean peoples, but that it means, in whatever sense the term is taken: what must be called collective agents of enunciation are all multiplicities, whatever their nature. So that we must explain how machinic agents of enunciation effectively produce variable statements in such and such circumstances, and produce new types of statements; how these statements are necessarily desires; and how, within this production, the illusion of the subject is engendered, of a subject split into a subject of enunciation and a subject of the statement, who has the impression of producing statements which, in fact, are produced by machinic assemblages or by the multiplicities acting in him.</p><p>We have to see how all this happens. We have to pose the problem practically! We have to pose a series of oppositions, we have to make a table: how is a body without organs produced, the first production of the statement. I mean: if something, in given conditions, does not function as a body without organs, there is no surface on which to inscribe a statement. A body without organs is the surface of inscription for every statement or for every desire. Except there is not a single body without organs, there are as many as you like. It’s a thing to produce or fabricate. A body without organs does not preexist. Last time, I took the desert as a model, but on the condition that certain things take place on it. The desert is indeed a place or a surface for the production of statements. There are no statements linked to drugs that do not presuppose as prior the constitution of a body without organs. . . . whatever takes place on the order of the event, i.e., the statement or desire, the event is finally the very identity of the statement and of desire, whatever takes place implies the constitution of a body without organs. As long as you have not made your body without organs, alone, with someone else, with n people, nothing is possible, you have to find your own.</p><p>In the bad column, that of the false conception of desire, we’ll put the organism. Here, it would be necessary to show how a body without organs is formed on this organism, how there appears on it a probe head, a machinic point, and this machinic point is this instance of movement that will be found later in this or that assemblage. The body without organs, the desert, is fundamentally populated. The problem of the unconscious is not really that of generations, it is a problem of population, it is a matter of know how one populates. When [André] Green writes, don’t go too far, a schizophrenic is someone who has a father and mother like everybody else, it’s not true. [<em>The reference to Green occurs earlier, in</em> Anti-Oedipus, <em>notably p. 305</em>]</p><p>I have here a text by an old schizo, it’s very beautiful, this text. It’s made up of tales: “I love to invent people, tribes, racial origins … and to imagine other behaviors, a thousand other ways of being. I have always had a complex for exploration, and I only like to count on very fantastic explorations. For example, my deserts are like diversions, desert-diversions, for whomever can imagine these strange simulators of [<em>missing word</em>], these kinds of oneiric songs. I let myself go; I have the tendency to put my guilty experiences on my characters, to mistreat them” — you see it is a matter of populating the desert — “to use mental cruelty against them, by provocation. I have the rage to imagine how that can work, a being in an extreme situation, after all, it’s a passion . . .” [<em>tape inaudible</em>]. In all these tales, it is solely a question of deserts populated with tribes: “I return from my tribes. As of today, I am the adoptive son of fifteen tribes, no more, no less. And they in turn are my adopted tribes, for I love each of them more than if I had been born into it.” [<em>For this citation, unattributed, see</em> A Thousand Plateaus, <em>p. 30</em>] Over there, a child has the right to adopt another tribe. There are many renegade children, and they don’t feel exiled at all. But their true parents? What do you mean by their true parents? Their true progenitors, their parents, are first of all whomever the child recognizes as such, progenitors or adopted, that is to say, the tribes. One is a child of a population and not the child of a father or a mother. A schizo thinks like that.</p><p>In the other column, as opposed to assemblages of multiplicities, there is the theme of the subject of enunciation, the split subject as the source of dualisms. To the anti-Oedipal apparatus is opposed the Oedipal apparatus, or to the becoming inhuman, the becoming animal, is opposed the becoming human of the other column. To monism-pluralism is opposed the dualities that follow from the false conception of the statement. To desire or the thought-process is opposed the conception of desire-lack-pleasure-jouissance; just as the two statuses of the sign we looked at last time are opposed, namely, the sign gathered together in a network that subordinates it to the signifier, and on the contrary, the sign that sets to work on its own account, that frees itself from the hypothesis of the signifier and which is coupled with a particle or a system of particles, i.e., the sign-particle as opposed to the sign-signifier. It would be necessary to know what machinic point marks the maximum of deterritorialization on this body without organs; this history of the machinic point that will mark the currents of deterritorialization on the BwO seems to me to be very complicated. It is also necessary to see the machinic assemblages that flow from it, and then the becomings animal, or, what amounts to the same thing, the intensities. The deterritorialized intensities that crisscross [quadrillent] the body without organs. And in all this, the subject is, à la lettre, a nomadic particle which traverses all that, the lines of deterritorialization, the intensities. The problem of the genesis of the illusion is: What is going to fix the subject? At the same time, it will be turned into an organism, it will be submitted to the cogito, it will be fixed, its submission will be assured, by telling it: it’s you who produces statements.</p><p>Next time, we’ll have to look at Carlos Casteneda’s book. [<em>While Deleuze and Guattari cite several in</em> A Thousand Plateaus, <em>this first reference is likely to the first in the Don Juan series,</em> The Teachings of Don Juan <em>(Berkeley: University of California Press, 1971</em>] It recounts, broadly speaking, not an initiation, but truly an experimentation. The guy would indeed like to be initiated, because he’s a poor guy, and the Indian tells him no problem. Carlos says to him: teach me, I want to know, i.e., he treats the old Indian like one treats one’s psychoanalyst, and the Indian tells him: begin by finding your body without organs. Carlos’s search for his BwO is pathetic, he is looking in a restrained space, in a kind of desert, that’s the joyous experimentation; and in a certain way, this search is to find the place where one is at ease [la place où on est bien]. From a schizoanalytic perspective, the guy has to find where he is at ease, and in what position, if he wants to hang from the ceiling. . . . There’s no reason for him to lie down. And Carlos looks for his place by rolling around in the grass, he seeks until he finds. Once he’s found his place, he no longer lives as a subject, but as a tiny thing [truc], a tiny particle, and then there is a more brilliant particle, the Indian.</p><p>Then, a machinic assemblage begins. In what form? In the form that it is necessary to have an ally. On the one hand, it is necessary to have a teacher, an experimenter, but it is also necessary to have a powerful ally. All this begins to make a little machine where something is going to happen; a certain distribution of intensities is already being drawn on this body without organs. And then he sees a dog, he plays at being dog [il fait le chien], but it’s not that either, he doesn’t play dog; he is in the process of undoing the organization of the body in favor of something else. One feels that the problem is not that of becoming animal; the dog is not a dog. The Indian says: that’s not a dog, it’s anything at all, whatever you like. What is this type of becoming inhuman, which is expressed badly in saying “he’s playing dog”? He has traversed certain intensities, which one can represent by: dog, as in Kafka. Kafka also plays dog, but he doesn’t need drugs to do so; he invented another machine for himself in order to do it. At the end, Carlos annoys the Indian so much that the Indian says to him, “But this dog, what, you take yourself for what? It’s not your whore of a mother.” That’s anti-psychoanalysis. This dog here is the outcome [sortie] of the Oedipal apparatus. He followed his body without organs, lines of deterritorialization following deterritorialized intensities.</p><p>Why these intensities rather than others? He’ll then become a lizard; then he’ll progress, he’ll become a crow. To play the crow [faire le corbeau] truly consists in making the legs and wings of the crow grow from his face, to be populated with crows. It was not to play dog, it was to be populated with dogs. To play dog, it is not enough to go “woof, woof, woof,” one has to pass through other experimentations. This changes everything in the problem of totemism.</p><p>When structuralists speak of totemism, it’s rather poor, dry. Totemism has always had certain relations with the history of drugs, but it is not that at all, for in the second book, where the experimentation continues even more strongly, we witness the passage from becoming inhuman, from becoming intense to something yet again which is a kind of becoming molecular, as if the disorganisation of the organism in favor of a body living in another mode, again implying something more. And that’s clairvoyance. What does it mean to see inside? [<em>Given the context, the reference is no doubt to Carlos Castaneda’s second book,</em> A Separate Reality <em>(1971)</em>]</p><p>That consists above all in seeing water, and Carlos, through an entire series of stages, sees the water that is modified, hardened, immobilized, and which, above all, is dissociated. At the end, it is molecularized and he grasps the water through its constitutive bubbles; but he can’t grasp and see the water through the constitutive molecular bubbles except in connection [liaison] with what is produced by experimentation . . .

What is this way of experiencing things, animals or persons as a function of affects that we attribute to them? To what is this opposed? What is Little Hans trying to create by means of this method? And as a way to resist what?</p></blockquote><p><em>This session’s focal topic, Freud’s case known as “Little Hans”, emerges in <em>A Thousand Plateaus</em> as early as “Introduction: Rhizome” (p. 14), and with Melanie Klein’s Little Richard and Agnes, is the topic of Deleuze’s 1977 essay (with Guattari, Claire Parnet and André Scala) “The Interpretation of Utterances”, in <em>Two Regimes of Madness</em> (New York & Cambridge MA: Semiotext(e)/MIT Press, 2006), pp. 89-112. In contrast to analysis establishing imaginary analogies and a structural system of homologies in “Little Hans”, Deleuze insists on understanding the machinic assemblage whereas Melanie Klein emphasizes the child’s phantasms, blocking the child’s statements and production of unconscious, and André Green’s third way robs the child of his/her affects. Deleuze argues that Hans’s discourse enumerates diverse affects which are closely related to a becoming or a passage. André Scala intervenes to comment on the manner in which Freud’s interpretation creates organ analogies, then introduces Hans’s phobia rather than accept (or even see) his becoming-horse. Deleuze responds by pointing out the extent to which psychoanalysis gets involved with confusing the problem of differences between sexes and suggests that all these remarks reveal the importance of affects as part of assemblages and of revealing the potential of what someone or something is capable (clearly linked to the becoming-Spinozan developed in plateau 10 of <em>A Thousand Plateaus</em>). Richard Pinhas suggests that affects are linked to fluctuations of intensities and to passage from intensity to intention while another student suggests that this shift also corresponds to discontinuous movements of potential energy, the session ending during this student’s remarks.</em></p><p><strong>About little Hans</strong>
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-01-17/#_edn1 rel=noopener>**[1]**</a></p><p>… even in terms of little Hans’ relationship with the horse, we will see a number of responses that will consist in saying that the relation is analogical, or else responses that would amount to saying that the relationship is homological and that we must establish the structural system that accounts for this. We, on the contrary, will go in a completely different direction by speaking of a <em>machinic assemblage</em>
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-01-17/#_edn2 rel=noopener>2</a> that excludes both imaginary analogies and structural homologies.</p><p>I would add that we are far from being done with this business of the internal contract in psychoanalysis, because if Melanie Klein announced the move, “I exchange your affects for fantasies”, and that this was a way of breaking the child and of preventing him from producing his own utterances or from bringing forth his unconscious, a move even worse than that of Freud, now we have a third phase. They have found another way: I take a recent book by André Green called <em>L’enfant de ça</em>
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-01-17/#_edn3 rel=noopener>3</a> which is very interesting in this respect because Green asks: what is it that has been lacking in psychoanalysis? What has been lacking in psychoanalysis is a theory of thought, and he says: in the end, I, Andre Green, consider myself a disciple of Wilfred Bion – an English psychoanalyst – rather than of Lacan, because Bion is the first to have come up with a psychoanalytical theory of thought… but to know what this psychoanalytic theory of thought consists in, you have to read Green’s texts.</p><p>And he says very eloquently that the real psychoanalytic exchange would be “you give me your affects, and in return I will give you thought”. The psychoanalyst assumes the role of thinker, and what happens when the psychoanalyst assumes the role of thinker can hardly be believed: the hour of the cogito makes its return. It has returned under the name of holy castration. The current state of the analytic exchange is no longer: “you give me your affects, and I’ll give you perception”, or “you give me your affects, and I’ll give you fantasy”, now it’s – and note the Kleinian nonsense of this – give me your affects and take care of your own fantasies, that is to say, of a theater. And it’s no trouble for anyone to set up a little theatre in the corner, as long as it doesn’t burn down your school. That’s what an affect is, it’s a fire! Melanie’s famous ideal amounts to the same thing: we find ourselves faced with these little paranoiacs and a child who experiences his body-machine… who experiences it as a power, a potency, that is to say that he is indeed a little paranoiac. But there’s nothing wrong with these little paranoiacs, they’re not bad people. All they want is for the machine to work. They are even very ingenious; a little paranoiac isn’t sick, they have no need of anyone.</p><p>And what does Melanie Klein want? Her great battle cry is: I will make you pass from the paranoid position to the depressive position – I’m not making this up – she constructs a whole theory so as to show the superiority of the depressive position, which attains the sacred unity of the ego with the good object and so on, all that crap, considering the culture of fantasy as a particularly life-enhancing thing. This is the good position, the depressive position: we have broken the little paranoiac. And this is considered a successful cure. I still have a vivid memory of Lacan’s texts where he speaks about didactic psychoanalysis and where he says that intensive psychoanalysis is that which must pass through the depressive position.</p><p>Now the objections that Green makes, and it is not by chance that Mr. Green objects to me, saying: “you never talk about depressives; you don’t know what a depressive is”.
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-01-17/#_edn4 rel=noopener>4</a> This is precisely his whole trick: to transform a kind of paranoid potency into a depressive impotence that it is at one with the exchange: affects-forces replaced by fantasies, or programs replaced by fantasies, and meanwhile the little guy is in his corner, not saying anything, that is, he is unable to produce his utterances.</p><p>We had left it at this, an extraordinary operation: little Hans in a vital way — in a vital way, quite independently of what the psychoanalysts say about it — little Hans describes the horse, and we don’t ask ourselves what this description of the horse signifies, we don’t take it as the object of an interpretation to be made. We just noticed last time that this description consisted of an enumeration of affects, and that these affects did not refer to the horse defined as an organism, to the horse such as a naturalist or a biologist might define it, but that it referred to the horse as a part or as a cog of a machinic assemblage, the assemblage in question being: horse-cariole-weight-driver of the horse.</p><p>And it was within the framework of this machinic assemblage that the affects by which little Hans not only described, but experienced the horse were distributed. I say “experienced” because he was launching himself into a kind of becoming-horse, in terms of a becoming-animal. This is a very curious or paradoxical operation, the temptation or the attempt to define or describe something or someone by the affects they supposedly experience. The question we will begin with today is: what does such an attempt mean? What does it imply? Because, after all, it is hardly self-evident. What would it mean logically or not logically? What is this way of living things, animals or persons according to the affects we lend them? What is it opposed to? What is little Hans trying to get across by this method? What is he trying to resist? To resist the oppression that comes from the family, the oppression that comes from the street and the city, the oppression that comes from psychotherapists, and this attempt by little Hans to maintain… no, no, the horse is a set of affects considered in terms of a machinic assemblage.</p><p>For us, this is very important because it already gives us the feeling that between an affect and a machinic assemblage, there is a relation, but which is not at all the same as the relation there is between organic determinations and an organism; that is something else altogether. So, what is it that he wants to assert and that psychoanalysis prevents him from so doing? It contains a description of things, of beings and of animals in terms of affects. He is looking for something, what he wants is something that is inseparable from a becoming-horse. This engages us already a little: the fact that <em>the affect is inseparable from a becoming</em>, the affect is inseparable from a passage. To what does a descriptive thought by affects oppose itself? But here we should proceed very much in order…</p><p><strong>André Scala:</strong> There is a very important text, because it contains everything we need to know about Freud’s method, it’s on page 98 of “Little Hans”, note 3. Following a reflection by little Hans on the way little girls make pee-pee, little Hans says that little girls have a pee-pee maker because they make pee-pee. Freud says that one could be disturbed by this early alteration of the childish intellect. Why don’t these investigators affirm what they actually see, which is that little girls don’t have a pee-pee maker. So why doesn’t Hans himself ask this question? We can say that Hans links the pee-pee maker, not to a form or function, but to a functioning, to a machinic assemblage, which means, he says, that everything has a pee-pee maker except chairs or tables. A locomotive has a pee-pee maker, a cow has one, a horse, the father, the mother. One can ask the question: if little girls do not have a pee-pee maker, how do they pee? Freud answers that this is not the question, it is only of secondary importance; peeing is secondary to the pee-pee maker. We will see in Hans’ experiments, when he holds himself back from urinating, that this is perhaps how one can know if it’s possible to pee through another organ. There is a first stage of organ analogies, that is to say that Freud replies that yes, little girls do pee but it happens differently. It’s a bit like fish who have gills and men who have lungs, they both breathe but they don’t breathe in the same way and the organs – gills-lungs, little girl-little boy – these are organs called analogues. That’s the first thing.</p><p>Secondly, Freud makes little Hans say: I want to have a pee-pee maker as big as a horse’s. There doesn’t seem to be a text where Hans actually says: I want a pee-pee maker as big as a horse’s. He never says this because for him the horse is not a goal, it’s a becoming. The second thing is Freud’s assignment of the becoming-horse, in terms of transcendence, that is to say that the horse is obviously bigger than little Hans. It has a penis that is much, much larger than that of little Hans, and this will allow Freud, by way of the obvious, to introduce the element of phobia. Of course, in the experimentation, in the becoming-horse, there is fear and anguish, but there is never phobia in terms of confrontation with a model.</p><p>And here we have the third reversal concerning Freud’s erroneous perception: Freud says that the erroneous perception of little Hans is, finally, the work of his unconscious. He says that he guesses that little girls have a pee-pee maker in the form of the clitoris, and this is the moment of structural homology. The clitoris-penis homology exceeds the analogy of function. We should see these three stages and how Freud, through these three moments – analogy, eminence, and homology – how he closes the loop of erroneous perception, unconscious, and how this circuit is that of Freud’s analysis and how he short-circuits the affects and injects phobia.</p><p><strong>Deleuze:</strong> If I understand correctly, there is a point that touches on psychoanalysis in its most fundamental domain, and this concerns the problem of the difference of the sexes. According to what Scala has said, it is very striking that as soon as psychoanalysis gets involved in thinking about the problem of the difference of the sexes, it does so by borrowing modes of thought that are logically easy to inventory, namely, either the large analogy of perception, what we can call the learned analogy or the homology that we would now call structural. A typical example in psychoanalysis is where little Hans says, sometimes in the form of questions, sometimes in the form of assertions… he says that girls, too, have a pee-pee maker. This is one of little Hans’ propositions, which perhaps involves many things. But what we notice is the way that in the psychoanalysis of a child an idea is already crushed because what Hans hears is precisely this: I know that they don’t have one, but they have it by analogy. Last time we saw the famous analogy Freud proposes between the penis and the clitoris. And immediately, Freud says: why does he want to maintain that little girls have a pee-pee maker, if only by analogy? It is because of his fear of castration.</p><p>In my view, in everything that little Hans said, there is nothing that in any way, shape or form, indicates this, absolutely nothing. It’s all in Freud’s head. It is Freud who believes that little girls do not have a pee-pee maker and that, if they have one, it can only be by analogy. Therefore, female sexuality is conceived by way of analogy with male sexuality. Freud’s position is well known; basically, it is that there is only one sexuality, the sexuality of the boy, whereas feminine sexuality is indeed a sexuality by analogy. When, with Melanie Klein, psychoanalysis began to lean in a slightly more progressive direction in this domain, it consisted in saying: yes, finally, there are two sexualities, a male sexuality and a female sexuality. So at that point, between the two sexualities, what relation could there be? No longer a relation of rough analogy, but a relation of so-called structural homology, as if there were homology between two structures.</p><p>Now, following Scala’s remark, the problem has arisen of this perpetual procedure of thinking sexuality in terms of analogy or homology. We’ll look at this, and we’ll just keep it in mind for now. Perhaps little Hans thinks in a different way; perhaps the thought processes of little Hans are completely different, which is why he will never be able to say what he has to say because from the beginning, his thought is molded in terms of schemas and processes that have nothing to do with him.</p><p>Where will this business of analogies and homologies lead us? You understand, if we are looking for what is truly original or creative in statements, we rediscover our initial question: what is original in an attempt to define things, beings or animals in terms of affects and not through anything else? Now, as for the affects of the horse, we have made a list of these and we have seen what assemblage they fit into. Suppose I say that between a table, a horse, a dog, a girl, a boy, the differences consist only in the fact that they are not affected by the same things. In other words, these differences are always… they always concern <em>powers of being affected</em>. This may not seem very important, but oddly, things, animals and people already tend to lose their form. Everything still functions if I’m told that a dog is a mammal, that it has four legs, that it barks, whereas a horse is something else… well. But we enter a completely different atmosphere if we say that what really counts are <em>the affects of which someone or something is capable</em>.</p><p>Here, we venture into an unknown forest where things are distinguished only by the affects of which they are capable. Already, we are forced to go beyond the simple notion of affect. We go beyond the notion of affect by means of a more precise notion: the power of being affected. To be affected is a power. So, we define things, beings, animals, by powers. We can immediately at least see to what other kinds of scenarios this is opposed: we no longer define them by or in terms of genera or species. I would not say that a table is a manufactured thing, whereas a horse is an animal, just as I would not ask whether a person is male or female, but rather I would ask, what affects are you capable of? That is to say, what are your powers of being affected? In terms of a certain very, very simple way of thinking, it is perhaps here that we will see the most bizarre things happening: what is the meaning of this power of being affected?</p><p>So the list of horse-affects that little Hans drew up as his experience went on, you remember, whether it was kicking, having hindquarters, being an anal animal, that is, making dung, pulling carts, pulling overweight carts, falling under excessive weight, all of thi defines the horse’s power of being affected.</p><p><strong>A student:</strong> In industry, in transportation, we use this term: assignment. You can be assigned to or deassigned from something: such and such a locomotive is assigned to transport goods. I don’t know if we can talk about powers; it’s more a question of efficiency rather than powers.</p><p><strong>Deleuze:</strong> Well, what does it mean to be disaffected? To be disaffected, that is to say, no longer to be affected in the order of certain affects.</p><p><strong>The student:</strong> An affect is something that is free, that is susceptible to being affected in different ways, free in the sense that Freud speaks of free energy that can oscillate between various poles, whereas in practice it is something more determining. We would need to find something which allows us to pass from the affect to something more precise, but more free. To pass from the affect in the machinic assemblage… which would be embodied in something individualized…</p><p><strong>Another student:</strong> When you say that energy is embodied, it doesn’t work anymore. An affect already constitutes a system in a certain sense.  There are no free affects. You don’t do anything with oil, for example. You don’t do anything with water, which is to say that each affect is already something affected…</p><p><strong>Deleuze:</strong> Thanks to what you two have said, we have now a group of notions: affects, assignments of function and powers.</p><p><strong>Richard Pinhas:</strong> What I liked very much in the little text that André read, and in the commentary that he made, is that it very clearly shows an operation that is at the same time that of psychoanalysis – it pertains to psychoanalysis in the sense that it’s part of the contract – and that also pertains more or less to capital, but only to a certain extent and in another manner. And the whole process that we see at work in Freud’s analysis of little Hans is this transformation, which is practically a real transmutation of intensities into intentions, intentions that will play the role of simulacra of intensities. And these intensities, finally, we can put them in conjunction with the notion of affect, in a certain way. It’s a bit adventurous, but I see it as a kind of qualification of the quantitative.</p><p>In other words, I would see the affect as a point, as a point that we would take in a chain – but the chain is a crude metaphor – that we would take in a flow – this is already less metaphorical – and a point that would note, that would denote or rather designate a variation and a fluctuation of intensities, in other words a rise or a fall, whatever you want to call it, you can call it anything you like, and that’s why in the affect we would only have singular positions and we would have no link …</p><p><strong>Deleuze:</strong> Yes, but in these variations and fluctuations, we should also see thresholds, thresholds to cross.</p><p> <strong>A student:</strong> [<em>Inaudible remarks</em>].</p><p><strong>Pinhas:</strong> I was talking about the passage from intensity to intention. If I try to define the intensity-affects pole, what we have is a pole that is composed of singularities, whereas in intention, that is to say in the simulacra of intensities, in the simulacra of affects, in the simulacrum of identity or in this identity that capital makes for you, in this kind of organic body that capital makes for you, we are in a completely different sphere: we are in that of exchange. What I liked is that in the very nature of affect, and on the side of intensities, we have a kind of plane where there are only metamorphic processes. We pass from one affect to another without causes, without reasons, without goals. It happens and it happens as a pure process. Whereas on the side of the intention, we would have something that could be called fixity. We have what Freud is trying to do, that is to say fix desire, something that does not flow anymore, that no longer metamorphoses.</p><p>And the whole of Freud’s operation, finally, will be to identify the affective moments, the moments in the sense of affective powers, and to fix these powers in order to precisely exchange them in a movement that we saw last week: namely, to make this exchange: you give me your affects, I give you words. Finally, it is this process that, through the intermediary of simulacra, representations, images, will make your symptom disappear. I believe that there is something extremely important in this consideration of affect as a purely metamorphic process as opposed to a kind of fixity that the desire of psychoanalysis wants to impose at all costs.</p><p><strong>A student:</strong> We have not yet put enough emphasis – and I realize that part of your intervention fits into this – on potential energy as something profoundly discontinuous that is capable of both gradual fluctuations and jumps, discontinuities, thresholds, very rapid passages. At the level of potential energy, for example, there cannot be something like an equalization, there will be a very abrupt passage where we pass … [<em>Inaudible remarks</em>] [<em>End of recording</em>]</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p><a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-01-17/#_ednref1 rel=noopener>1</a> Right from the first plateau of <em>A Thousand Plateaus</em>, “Rhizome: introduction”, Deleuze and Guattari are greatly concerned with the figure of Freud’s “Little Hans”.  See p. 13 on Melanie Klein’s “Little Richard”; see also the collective text (with Guattari, Claire Parnet, and André Scala) “The Interpretation of Utterances”<em>,</em> in <em>Two Regimes of Madness: texts and interviews 1975-1995</em>, trans.

After developing these three facets, Deleuze insists that these notions are linked to another one, that of category, i.e. the concept said of every possible object of experience, which has a cause and which itself causes other things. He</strong> shifts the focus back to univocity as something strange and difficult to think about, introducing Duns Scotus’s views on univocal being, at the border of heresy, but maintaining being as physically analogical while metaphysically univocal. To get out of the analogical-univocal impasse Deleuze concludes, with Spinoza, that differences between beings consist in difference understood solely as degrees of power (<em>puissance</em>), and not distinguished by their form, genus, or species. Deleuze explains the linkage between degrees of power and univocity of being, and drawing from Spinoza’s <em>Ethics</em>, Deleuze distinguishes French logic of the “cogito” from English, non-egocentric logic, and both of these from Spinoza’s thinking of degrees of <em>puissance</em>. To a student’s comment, Deleuze distinguishes such potential energy from Nietzsche’s concept of will to power. For Spinoza, this is a political perspective, dominant <em>pouvoir</em> (power, power over) in contrast to <em>puissance</em> (power of action), and in contrast to a discourse of representation structured by analogical principles, Spinoza’s assemblage of affects constitutes a critique of representation. Deleuze concludes the session by tracing how <em>The Ethics</em> functions to undermine analogical representation, via an appearance of continuity which, in fact, is sequences of propositions, demonstrations, corollaries, and <em>scholia</em>, hence a secret mode of discontinuity.</p><p><strong>The Univocity of Being</strong></p><p>I must pass through a kind of terminological detour. This detour consists in recalling a certain terminology. We find that, in the whole current of the Middle Ages up to and including the seventeenth century, a certain problem is posed concerning the nature of being. And this problem concerning the nature of being adopted some very precise notions: equivocity, analogy, univocity.</p><p>At first sight these terms appear dead to us. They make up part of the great discussions of Scholasticism, but the great metaphysical disputes always hide something else: people are never burned or tortured over ideological questions, even less over metaphysical ones. I would like for us to try to feel what was very concretely in question in these stories which were presented under an abstract form: is being equivocal, is it analogical, is it univocal? And after all, this is not because today, except among the seminarians, we have abandoned these terms, not because we do not continue to think in them and through them.</p><p>I would like to content myself with very simple definitions. There are people who said: being is equivocal. They argued, they burned one another for things like that. But “being is equivocal” meant a precise thing: being is said in several senses. That means: being is said in several senses of that of which it is said. That is to say that the implication [sous-entendu] of the proposition was already: being is said of something. I’m not even interested in knowing if it’s an ontological problem; it’s a problem of utterances [énoncés] as well. Being is stated [s’énonce] in several senses of that of which it is stated. Concretely, what does that mean? One assumes that a table is not in the same manner as an animal and that an animal is not in the same manner as a man; that a man is not in the same manner as God. Therefore there are several senses of being.</p><p>Those who were called the partisans of equivocity, no matter who they were, argued a very simple thing: that the different senses of the word “being” were without common measure and that, in all rigor—and what is interesting in theology are always the limit points at which heresy peeks out—in every doctrine one can always locate the exact point where, if the person says a word more, that’s it, the machine is set in motion, one starts a process. That runs through the whole history of the Middle Ages, it’s very interesting because it’s an actual struggle of an obviously political nature.</p><p>Well then, the heretical point of equivocity is that those who said that being is said in several senses, and that these different senses have no common measure, understood that at the limit they would have preferred to say: “God is not,” rather than to say “He is” to the extent that “He is” was a utterance which was said of the table or the chair. Or else He is in a such an equivocal manner, such a different manner, without common measure with the being of the chair, with the being of man, etc… that, all things considered, it’s much better to say: He is not, which means: He is superior to being. But if they had a sense of wordplay this became very dangerous, it sufficed that they insist only a little on “God is not,” if they were discreet they said “God is superior to being,” but if they said “God is not,” that could turn out badly. Broadly speaking they were partisans of what is called the equivocity of being.</p><p>Then there were those who were partisans of the Univocity of being. They risked even more because what does this mean, univocity, in opposition to the equivocity of being? And all the treatises of the Middle Ages are filled with long chapters on the univocity or equivocity of being, it’s very interesting. But those who said that being is univocal, supposing that they had done so and were not immediately burned, what did that mean? That meant: being has only one sense and is said in one and the same sense of everything of which it is said. Here one feels that if the equivocists already had such a possible sin in themselves, the univocists were thinkers who told us: of everything which is, being is said in one and the same sense—of a chair, of an animal, of a man or of God. Yet again, I’m simplifying everything because perhaps they didn’t dare go that far, perhaps there’s only a single thinker who would have gone that far, perhaps none, but in the end there is this idea.</p><p>And then inevitably there are those who were between the two, between the univocists and the equivocists. Those who are between the two are always those who establish what we call orthodoxy. These people said that being is not univocal because it’s a scandal; to claim that being is said in one and the same sense of God and of the flea is a terrible thing, we must burn people like that; and then those who say “being is said in several senses which have no common measure,” we no longer know where we are with them: there is no order anymore, there’s no longer anything. Thus these third people said: being is neither equivocal nor univocal, it’s analogical. Here we can say the name, the one who elaborated a theory of analogy on the basis of Aristotle, Saint Thomas, and historically he won. Being which is analogical meant: yes, being is said in several senses of that of which it is said. Only these senses are not without common measure: these senses are governed by relations of analogy. Thus the equivocity of being, the univocity of being, the analogy of being, you’re going to ask me where all this leads us?</p><p>So what does this mean: being is said in several senses of that of which it is said? And these senses are not without common measure, they have an analogical measure. Well then, in Saint Thomas’ theses, which I am simplifying a lot, this means two things, because analogy, which is taken here in a technical or scientific sense, analogy was double, in any case taken in a technical or scientific sense, that is to say that it was not a question of common analogy. Common analogy is simple similarity of perception: something is analogous to something else. If you like it’s the similarity of perception or the analogy of imagination, generally speaking. Scientific or technical analogy, the analogy of concepts, is double: the first sense was termed by Saint Thomas “analogy of proportions” and the second was termed by Saint Thomas “analogy of proportionality.”</p><p>The analogy of proportion was the following: being is said in several senses and these senses are not without common measure, they have an internal measure, they have a conceptual measure, they have a measure in the concept. Why? Well, in the first sense of the analogy of proportion, that meant—because there’s a primary sense of the word “being” and then derived senses—the primary sense of the word “being” was what’s often translated by the term “substance” or sometimes by the term “essence.” The other senses of the word “being” were the different senses of the word “being” which were derived from the primary sense following a law of proportion. Thus being was said in several senses, but there was a primary sense from which the others were derived.</p><p>This has hardly carried us forward because the primary substance was not univocal, it wasn’t said in a single sense. At the level of substance in its turn there were going to be analogies, namely: substance was said in several analogical senses, and of that which was substance it was necessary to say that certain substances were primary in relation to others, which were not substance in the same sense. For example, the so-called “incorruptible” substances were primary in relation to the perishable substances. Thus the analogy of proportion consisted in setting out a plurality of hierarchized and methodical senses on the basis of a sense that was assumed to be primary. This was the analogy of proportion.</p><p>And then the second form of scientific analogy, which was not opposed to the first, this was the analogy of proportionality, which consisted this time in a figure quite close to its equivalent, mathematical analogy: A is to B as C is to D. Example given by Saint Thomas: God is good. Following the analogy of proportion: God is good and man is good; following the analogy of proportion God is formally good, that is to say possessing in Himself goodness in the plenitude of this quality, and man is only good by derivation insofar as he is a creature of God, thus man is secondarily good. This is the analogy of proportion. The analogy of proportionality is the same example, but you must sense how it changes. What infinite goodness is to God, finite goodness is to man.</p><p>I would add, to finish with this: yet again do we not continue to think theologically? To this whole group of notions, analogy, analogy of proportion, analogy of proportionality, was linked a very precise notion which was that of category. In what way did the categories make up part of the analogical vision or the analogical conception? For example, the categories, common to Aristotle and much later to Kant, let’s put down substance, quantity, etc. Why categories and not concepts? What difference is there between the concept of causality or quantity and the concept of lion? Quite simple: every thing, all that is not [connected?], alternatively everything that is substance, has a quality, a quantity, etc. Hence the very strict definition of what must be called a category: one calls categories the concepts which are said of every possible object of experience. Lion is not a category because you cannot say “lion” of every possible object of experience. On the other hand, every possible object of experience has a cause and is itself cause of other things. There, that clarifies everything. The categories, thus defined, are strictly inseparable from an analogical conception; one calls categories the concepts which are said of every possible object of experience, or what amounts strictly to the same thing: the different senses of the word “being.” And the categories in Aristotle are presented as the different senses of the word “being,” exactly as in Kant the categories are defined as the concepts which are said of every possible object of experience. Therefore there’s no question of a thought proceeding by categories if it does not have, as background, the idea that being is analogical, which is to say that being is said of what is in an analogical manner.</p><p>At this point I make a leap: what appears to me the strangest thought, the most difficult to think, if it has ever been thought, is univocity. Suppose someone arrives there, in an assembly of priests, or even here and says: being is said absolutely in one and the same sense of everything of which it is said. One could say that this does not go very far, but this means precisely that being is univocal, that is to say neither analogical nor equivocal—and understand well that in the Middle Ages those sorts were very up-to-date on all this, as you are—if someone happened by speaking of univocity of being, he was quickly spotted, he could pack his bags; that meant, yet again, that a chair, an animal, a man and God are in one and the same sense. Then what: you treat God as matter? Are a dog and a man in the same sense? Quite tricky, that.</p><p>And nevertheless there is a man, the greatest thinker of the Middle Ages, who says yes, being is univocal, that is Duns Scotus. This story of Duns Scotus’ univocal being turns out rather badly—but happily he took precautions, he said yes but be careful: being is univocal insofar as it is being. That is to say that it’s metaphysically univocal. He said: sure it’s analogical, which is to say that it’s said in several senses physically. This is what interests me: he was at the border of heresy, had he not specified metaphysically univocal and physically analogical, he would have been done for. But for Duns Scotus’ disciples, less prudent than he was, it turned out badly. Because I say: being is univocal, this means there is no categorical difference between the assumed senses of the word “being” and being is said in one and the same sense of everything which is. In a certain manner this means that the tick is God; there is no difference of category, there is no difference of substance, there is no difference of form. It becomes a mad [démente] thought.</p><p>My question is, if I say being is univocal, it’s said in the same sense of everything of which it’s said, then what could the differences between [beings?] be? They can no longer be differences of category, they can no longer be differences of form, they can no longer be differences of genus and species. And why can they no longer be all that? Because, once again, if I say: the differences between beings are differences of form, are formal, generic, specific differences, at that moment I cannot escape from the analogy of being for this simple reason: the categories are the ultimate genera of being. If I say: there are several senses of the word “being” which are precisely the categories, I must say that what is, that of which I say, “this is,” is distinguished by the form, the species, the genus. On the other hand, if I say that being is univocal and that it’s said in one and the same sense of everything of which it’s said, I fall into that which becomes the mad thought, the thought of infamy, the thought of the formless, the thought of the non-specific, the thought of the non-generic.</p><p>The only means of getting out of this is to say: of course there are differences between beings, and in any case being is said in one and the same sense of everything which is. Then what do the differences between beings consist in? The only difference conceivable at this very moment, from the point of view of a univocal being, is obviously difference solely as degrees of power [puissance]. Beings are not distinguished by their form, their genus, their species, that’s secondary; everything which is refers to a degree of power.</p><p>Why is the idea of degrees of power fundamentally linked to that of the univocity of being? Because beings which are distinguished solely by the degree of their power are beings which realize a single univocal being, except for the difference in the degree of power or its withdrawal. So between a table, a little boy, a little girl, a locomotive, a cow, a god, the difference is solely one of degree of power in the realization of one and the same being. It’s a strange way of thinking, since once again it consists in saying to us: the forms, the functions, the species and the genera are secondary. Beings are defined by degrees of power and there you are. Insofar as they are defined by degrees of power, each being realizes one and the same being, the same being as the other beings since being is said in one and the same sense, except for the difference in degree of power. At this level, there are no longer any categories, no longer any forms, no longer any species.</p><p>In a sense, it’s a thought so very far from the ordinary notions of species and genus that, once again, between two members of the same species there can be more differences, more differences in the degree of power than between two beings of different species. Between a racehorse and a draft horse, which belong to the same species, the difference can perhaps be thought as greater than the difference between a draft horse and an ox. Which comes down to saying that the draft horse and the ox are taken in the same assemblage [agencement] and that their degrees of power are closer to one another’s than is the draft horse’s degree of power to the racehorse’s.</p><p>A further step can be taken, that is, that this thought of degrees of power is linked, no longer to a conception of genera and species, but to a conception of assemblages into which each being is capable of entering. We had begun with Spinoza for Spinoza is perhaps the only one to have worked from the point of view [sous les espèces] of reason, to have pursued a kind [espèce] of mad thought. There’s always in Lovecraft, the author of novels of terror and science fiction, there’s always reference to a mysterious book which falls from the hands of whomever touches it and this book is called the Necronomicon, the famous book of the mad Arab. And Spinoza’s <em>Ethics</em> is just that, the famous book of the mad Jew. The true name of the <em>Ethics</em> is the Necronomicon. I had begun by explicating the following: imagine how Spinoza saw things; when he directed his eyes toward things he saw neither forms nor organs, neither genera nor species. It’s easy to say, but less easy to live like that. It’s necessary to train oneself, although there are those who are gifted.</p><p>I open a parenthesis: French philosophy…there are bits of nationality about which I understand nothing, but I note that the French are the sort who believe for example in the ego [moi]; it’s not by chance that their only philosopher said “cogito.” The subject, the ego; there are some strange people who say “the ego.” I don’t understand. I think of the differences of nationality because the English are the sort who have never understood what the Ego means. There was a famous colloquium to which all the sorts of so-called analytical philosophy, of current English logic, had come, and then there was Merleau-Ponty on the French side, and the others, the English, were there like they were at the zoo. It’s not that they were against him.</p><p>But it’s quite curious, if you take the great English philosophers—of course, they say “I,” but yet again it’s not this that’s the problem—for them it’s the most comical notion and they ask themselves from where can such a belief, that of the ego, come. A belief in the identity of the ego is a madman’s trick [truc de fous]. And they really think like that, they don’t sense “egos” in themselves. The English novelists are similar: their heroes are never presented as “egos.” Think of French novels, then it’s truly the opposite, one wallows in “egos,” everybody says “cogito” in the French novel.</p><p>Let’s try to imagine how Spinoza saw things. He did not see genera, species, he did not see categories, so what did he see? He saw differences of degrees of power… I said broadly that to each thing will correspond a kind of degree of power and that, if need be, two things said to be of the same species might have degrees of power much more different that two things of different species. To make this more concrete we say that to each degree of power corresponds a certain power of being affected. Its power of being affected is what reveals the degree of power of a thing, of an animal, of [<em>unclear word</em>]. In other words, you will not be defined by your form, by your organs, by your organism, by your genus or by your species, tell me the affections of which you are capable and I’ll tell you who you are. Of what affects are you capable? It’s self-evident that between a draft horse and a racehorse the power of being affected is not the same, in a fundamental way; the proof is that if you put a racehorse into the assemblage of a draft horse, it’s quite likely that it will be worn out in three days.</p><p>We have this group of notions: being is said in one and the same sense of everything of which it’s said; hence beings are not distinguished by their form, their genus, their species, they’re distinguished by degrees of power. These degrees of power refer to powers of being affected, the affects being precisely the intensities of which a being is capable. Now it’s becoming more coherent. With the result that, I assume, when Spinoza directed his eyes toward whatever, he grasped powers of being affected. He grasped populations of intensities, he grasped capacities and perhaps he confused an ox and a draft horse, and on the other hand he did not confuse a racehorse and a draft horse. As we would say today, he makes these cuts [coupures] differently than the others. Then there’s no more than an effort to accomplish.</p><p>In any case, it’s not necessary to believe that power [pouvoir] means a possibility that might not be fulfilled. Power [puissance] and degrees of power, this is no longer the Aristotelian world which is a world of analogy, it’s not power which is distinguished from the act. The power of being affected, in any case, is or will be fulfilled, is fulfilled at each instant; it’s necessarily fulfilled, and why? It’s necessarily fulfilled at each instant by virtue of the variable assemblages into which it enters. That is, the affect is the manner in which a degree of power is necessarily actualized [effectué] as a function of the assemblages into which the individual or the thing enters.</p><p>A power of being affected is always fulfilled; it can be fulfilled in different ways, everything depends on the assemblage. In what ways can it be fulfilled, since it’s fulfilled in any case? This is Spinoza’s last thought: he says broadly that it’s fulfilled in any case, but it can be fulfilled in two fashions. A degree of power is necessarily realized, or a power of being affected is necessarily fulfilled, that refers to these same two propositions, but very broadly speaking it can be fulfilled in two directions: either my power of being affected is fulfilled in such a way that my power of acting increases, or in such a way that my power of acting diminishes. Spinoza specifies: when my power of acting diminishes, this means, very broadly speaking, that my affects are sad; my power of being affected is completely fulfilled by sadness. For example “I’m guilty” or “I’m depressed” or “it’s not going well”; but “it’s not going well” completely fulfills my power of being affected.</p><p>And why, when my affects are sad, is my power of acting diminished while my power of being affected is fulfilled? The way in which Spinoza views people is very, very beautiful. It’s even more beautiful when one sees the objections that people made to him, for example that imbecile [débile] Hegel. When Hegel says, against Spinoza, “ah that one never understood anything of the labor of the negative,” it’s perfect, the labor of the negative is a load of crap. It’s not that he doesn’t understand, he understands very well: the labor of the negative or the sad passions are those which fulfill my power of being affected in conditions such that my power of acting necessarily diminishes. When I’m sad, my power of acting diminishes.</p><p>It’s obvious, it sufficed to think it: when you’re affected with sad affects, there’s an object, something, an animal or a person which combines with you and that person or thing affects you with sadness. But in the case of the sad affect, the power of the other thing and your own would be subtracted since all your efforts at that moment would consist in struggling against this sadness and hence your power and the power of the thing which affects you would be subtracted. When, on the contrary, you are affected with joyful affects, the power of the thing which affects you with joyful affects and your own power are combined and added so that your power of acting, for that same power of being affected which is your own, is increased. Thus everything is crystal clear.</p><p>There you are, the linkage of notions: univocity of being, differences of degrees of power, powers of being affected each of which corresponds to a degree of power, power of acting which increases or diminishes depending on whether the affects which fulfill your power of being affected are by nature sad or joyful.</p><p><strong>A student :</strong> Are the degrees of power degrees of the same power?</p><p><strong>Deleuze:</strong> Obviously. Power is being, therefore there’s only one single power and the differences of power are intensive differences.</p><p><strong>The student:</strong> Isn’t this in fact a model of causality? Several years ago we had interpreted causality in Spinoza in terms of structural causality. For my part, I think that one could interpret Spinoza’s thought in terms of energetic causality. Effectively this would be a substance defined as potential energy, and I would take this potential energy as an operational concept, a concept rigorously equivalent to the Nietzschean concept of the will to power.</p><p><strong>Deleuze:</strong> Okay. This seems dangerous to me because we’re just barely getting out of the abstract, and you’re putting us back into it. It’s not simply a question of a peculiar vision of the world; it’s again eminently a question of politics. Spinoza’s basic idea is very simple, it’s that there are two plagues of the human genus, and it’s in this that Spinoza is Nietzschean and Nietzsche is Spinozist. He says that there are two scourges: hatred and remorse. Nietzsche will say that there are two scourges: man as malady, ressentiment and bad conscience. Ressentiment and bad conscience are literally what Spinoza called hatred and remorse.</p><p>Here one could find a kind of psychiatric tableau of the affections of hatred and the affections of remorse. But what interests him in this way of seeing all that — this is not a psychiatry — what interests him is obviously politics. Spinoza asks himself: what are those things called powers-that-be [pouvoirs]? He posed the question of power in a ridiculous enough way: power [pouvoir] is opposed to power of action [puissance]; power of action [puissance] is concerns us personally, concerns each one of us, concerns animals, concerns things. But power [pouvoir] is something else. He asks how it functions: people take power over others. What does it mean to have power over someone? Having power over someone is being in a position to affect her or him in such and such a way. The powers-that-be are fundamentally institutions built to affect you with sadness, they work like that and can only work like that. Things like hope, reward and security are put on the side of sad affects.</p><p><strong>A student:</strong> Desire also.</p><p><strong>Deleuze:</strong> No, how awful, what are you saying? Don’t listen to him. — The powers-that-be only keep hold on us by affecting us, which is to say by fulfilling our power of being affected with sad affects, and undoubtedly thousands of ways of doing this exist. And what Spinoza had in view is the power of the State and the power of the Church. He thinks that the power of the State and the power of the Church are fundamentally powers which take hold of their subjects by affecting them with sad affects, which is to say that power depresses them. This is the fundamental operation of power; affecting us with sadness, which obviously implies a whole play of compensations, “if you were wise, you would have had a reward,” it’s for that reason that Spinoza puts the taste for medals on the side of the sad affects, rewards are like a kind of compensation for a fundamental sadness of being.</p><p>Power [pouvoir] and power of action [puissance] are opposed since power [pouvoir] is an institution which functions essentially by affecting us with sad affects, which is to say by diminishing our power of acting. It needs to diminish our power of action precisely in order to exercise its own power over us. On the contrary, the powers [puissances] of liberation are, or will be, those which affect us with joyful affects. If you’re sad you are oppressed, depressed… you’ve been had. How do they live, the sad and depressed? They live under the form of contagion, they won’t let you go. A depressed person is an explosive force, you grasp that. It’s tragic, it’s tragedy itself. Nietzsche developed this quite simple idea even further: the man of ressentiment is venomous; his idea is to render you ashamed of the least happiness. Spinoza won’t even say that social institutions furnish us with models. He will say that they fulfill us with affections. A social institution is a machine of affects; it fulfills your power of being affected. This is not ideological.</p><p>He’s really very, very clever, and truly in the Nietzschean sense of “why I am so clever,” he takes terms which are current in his epoch, most notably the Cartesian vocabulary, and turns it against Descartes.</p><p><strong>A student:</strong> [<em>Inaudible comment</em>]</p><p><strong>Deleuze:</strong> The whole discourse of representation is structured by analogical principles and thus Spinoza’s whole operation consists in making, in imposing a kind of assemblage of affects which implies likewise a critique of representation.</p><p>The <em>Ethics</em> is a book which proceeds via a quite malicious system; this system consists in producing texts, and then notes and notes to notes, and then notes to notes of notes. It’s obviously in the notes to notes that an enormous thing will be let loose. Spinoza himself found a far more formidable thing, and doubtless the geometrical method was necessary for that. His book has the appearance of being completely continuous, but in fact when one looks at it, one sees that there are propositions—like geometrical propositions—there are demonstrations, and then there are corollaries and then there are these strange things he calls <em>scholia</em>.</p><p>At first glance, it all follows. If you look closely, you’ll notice that in fact it’s not so tightly knit, that is to say the proposition-demonstration-corollary system is an autonomous system, that is the demonstrations always refer to other demonstrations or to other corollaries. And then the system of scholia is another system which coexists with the first and the scholia refer to one another. Thus there are two <em>Ethics</em> in one: an <em>Ethics</em> which functions in the mode of continuity and a secret <em>Ethics</em> which functions in the mode of discontinuity, and which is constituted by the scholia. If need be, there are forty pages without scholia and two scholia which refer to one another across these forty pages, and it’s in the scholia that he gives an aggressive version of what he says geometrically in the other system; so much so that, literally, the <em>Ethics</em> is simultaneously written twice: a violent and affective version and a rational and geometrical version.</p><p>It’s in the scholia that he says what an ethics is, to make an ethics is to make a theory and a practice of powers of being affected, and an ethics is opposed to a satirics [satirique]. What he calls a satirics is tremendous enough: it’s everything that takes pleasure one way or another in sad affects, everything which is depreciating and depressing. That’s the satirics. It’s obvious that all of morality goes under the name of satirics. What exactly does powers-that-be mean? And in what ways do the powers-that-be take hold in order to depress, to affect people with sad affects? … [<em>End of the text</em>]</p><hr><a href=#a-o-iii-lecture-3><h1 id=a-o-iii-lecture-3><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>A-O III: Lecture 3</h1></a><blockquote><p>This opens for us a direction of research allowing us to pose the question of the relationship between intensities, intensive affects and forms.

The question is to know if a form is susceptible in itself to intensive variations, that is, if it enjoys a dimension of latitude. The latitude of the forms was the possible variations of a form in intensities.</em></p><p> I would like us to be able to organize our paths of research here in line with the point we have reached. It seems to me that, given what we saw last time, we have three main directions.</p><p>The first direction is relative to what we saw last time: we had looked at a matter that we could call <em>the plane of composition</em>. This plane of composition was something we sometimes referred to as the plane of consistency, perhaps to place it more in relation with the operation of desire. Thanks to Spinoza, whose thinking was necessary in this regard, we were able to find a kind of compositional plane, a plane of consistency, which was defined by the unity of its materials, or in a certain way – which amounts to the same thing – by the position of univocity. This is a kind of thought that does not pass by way of forms, nor through organs or organisms, a kind of informal thought.</p><p>And to say that the plane of consistency is defined by a unity of materials also refers us to a system of variables, and these variables consisted – once we had established that they were the same materials in all assemblages – the variables consisted in the positions and the connections. It was the variation of positions and connections of the materials that constituted the so-called machinic assemblages, machinic assemblages whose common point was that they all realized the plane of consistency according to this or that degree of power.</p><p>So we have a first very marked link between the plane of composition or consistency and the machinic assemblages which realized this plane in various ways, according to the position and the connections of the materials in each assemblage. And finally, according to each assemblage, circulations and transformations of affects were produced, a machinic assemblage being like a place of passage, a place of transformation of intensive affects, and these intensive affects corresponded to the degrees of power of each machinic assemblage.</p><p>This opens up a research path that will allow us to pose the question of the relation between intensities, intensive affects and forms. What is the relation between intensive quantities and forms, specific forms, categorical forms and generic forms, and so on? How is an intensive thought which does not pass by way of these forms possible? The whole of Scholasticism is traversed by a problem which is of vital importance to it, since it lies at the crossroads of physics and theology. This is the problem they were very conscious of during the whole of the Middle Ages, that of the relation between intensities and forms. In medieval philosophical terms, this problem was known as the latitude and remission of forms. The question is to know if a form is in itself susceptible to intensive variations, that is to say if it enjoys a dimension of latitude. The latitude of forms consisted in the possible variations of a form in terms of its intensities. For example, can one be <em>more or less</em> reasonable? Here, we can see how it will be up to us to transform this old problem, and at least we can situate it as an old classical problem: man being defined for example as a reasonable animal, a reasonable animal as a form composed both of a generic determination: animal, and of a specific difference: reasonable.</p><p>To be more or less reasonable. What can it mean when a form is susceptible to a certain latitude? If one can be more or less reasonable, is it that, at a push, there will be a degree zero of being reasonable which will certainly not be the same thing as the way in which an animal is not reasonable. How could they pose this problem of the relationship between intensities and forms? And once again, this runs through all the physics of the Middle Ages, all these attempts to make a science of intensive quantities. We had a kind of mixture that we must take in a very muddled way and that revolved around a kind of thought of degrees of power, of the assemblages into which these degrees of power entered, of a critique of forms, and of the effort…  of Spinoza’s own effort to think degrees of power independently of forms, functions, species and kinds. All this constitutes a curious philosophy that revolved around  thinking immanence or the univocity of being. It all turns around a kind of theory of the machinic assemblages that one tries to pursue.</p><p>When we are told about a latitude of forms, before we have even seen what was meant by latitude in the Middle Ages, either we can say… I believe that in the Middle Ages, there were two main positions. There is the position which tells us, among other things, that a form itself can only be perfect, this is all that it has, therefore the notion of reasonable, for example, cannot be considered in terms of more or less. The plus or minus of the intensity, the latitude, that is, the thresholds between which <em>the play</em> of form takes place cannot come from the form itself. It can only come from the subject in which this form is realized or to which this form lays claim. <em>Latitude is not a property of the form itself; it is a property of the subject that receives it</em>. But there are others who would say that it is the form itself that is susceptible, under certain conditions, to a certain latitude, that is to say, that it plays between certain thresholds. What the two positions at least have in common is a certain subordination of the intensive latitude to the form.</p><p>In terms of the business of the egg, we had a very different position. There, it is the forms themselves that are as if subordinated to the intensive variations that determine them. In the question of the egg, the egg is considered as an intensive medium, and it is the thresholds of intensities which determine this or that form. It is as if the subordination between forms and intensities had been reversed. This is very important for us because, after all, it is by no means given that the egg is our past; this is a very dangerous conception, to consider that the egg is our past, since it naturally leads us on the path of regression. Is it not possible, not only from the point of view of embryology, but also from the point of view of the most lived experience, to conceive of the egg as being strictly always contemporary with ourselves, that is to say, that each of us carries our own egg with them, and what we call someone’s egg is his or her milieu of experimentation? So the egg is no longer in any way a refuge in the mode of a return to the mother, but is, if you like, the strictly contemporary placenta of ourselves. It is, finally, the milieu of strict contemporaneity. The egg is not at all the form in which I descend from a mother and incidentally from a father. The egg is like the contemporary plasma in relation to which father or mother and child are strictly contemporaneous with each other. The egg, strictly speaking, is the contemporary milieu where one cannot establish succession and in relation to which one cannot establish succession. From this point of view, the egg is really the contemporary intensive matter of any experimentation as such. It is always in the egg that one experiments. This is obviously a conception that always makes the egg our own past.

All that counts is the process of immigration itself; what yields an orifice fissure or primitive line is not invagination, but pure chronological and quantitative variations”
<a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-03-13/#_edn2 rel=noopener>2</a> – that is, whether an energetic flow reaches a certain threshold or not. There, forms, including organic forms, are really secondary to thresholds of intensities.</p><p><strong>Kyril Rejik:</strong> When was this text written?</p><p><strong>Deleuze:</strong> About 1930.</p><p><strong>Rejik:</strong> That’s as far from us as…</p><p><strong>Deleuze:</strong> Why do you say that?</p><p><strong>Rejik:</strong> You’re talking in terms of intensities, whereas he’s talking as a phenomenologist, an observer. Biochemistry wouldn’t work, and where you would have to go back to intensities is in quantum biochemistry, for example, at the level of electronics. It is the structure of proteins that determines the forms.</p><p>[WebDeleuze note: <em>A long polemic ensued</em>]</p><p><strong>Deleuze:</strong> I have the impression that this is not at all the same problem. Embryology deals with the way in which the egg develops and differentiates. When the embryologist claims around 1925-1930 that the determination of forms in relation to the development of the egg appeals to distributions of intensities, that is one thing; it does not claim to be molecular biology. To say that molecular biology goes beyond or is called to go beyond this point of view, seems to me to be without foundation. I am not saying that we should be satisfied with the egg as the ultimate unit. I am saying that whatever the state of physics or whatever the state of biology, there is indeed a problem which is the development of the egg as a – let’s use any word – a giant molecule, or molar unit. When someone is interested in the development of the egg and in the organization of intensities, to say to him: tell us about quantum physics, that is to say about the molecular elements which are, if necessary, mixed with this, takes on a whole other dimension.</p><p><strong>Rejik</strong>: It’s not “if necessary”; you’re talking like a finalist. You’re looking at the egg as if it were the pole that attracts the intensities.</p><p>[WebDeleuze note: <em>The discussion continues for some time</em>.]</p><p><strong>Deleuze</strong>: That was the first direction for me. Second direction…</p><p><strong>Georges Comtesse</strong>: In your view, is it the conflicting difference between the forces of attraction and repulsion that determines the production of intensities on the egg?</p><p><strong>Deleuze</strong>: No. Regarding that, I would say that the distributions of intensities on the egg are much more linked to molecular machinic assemblages.</p><p>The second direction, one that we have addressed on all the previous occasions, is that machinic assemblages have nothing to do with forms, with separable forms, specific forms or generic forms. Machinic assemblages always problematize units of levels and contents that are completely different. Insofar as machinic assemblages are not representations of something, but transformations of affects, they put into play all kinds of becomings, and for a simple reason: it is that <em>affect itself is a becoming</em>, it is an intensive passage. Among the becomings put into play in machinic assemblages, are a becoming-animal and a becoming-molecular. But it is these affects that fill a capacity of being affected, or that circulate within a machinic assemblage, that mark the notion of the becoming-animal. For example, the becoming-horse of little Hans, the notion of becoming-molecular, and all these various becomings occur either in relation to machinic assemblages or involve real movements of deterritorialization and reterritorialization.</p><p>It is this whole becoming-animal, becoming-molecular, and the movements of deterritorialization that must be analyzed in terms of a machinic assemblage. And in this respect, we had sketched out a kind of possible program for the becomings-animal. Once again, we had had the presentiment that becomings-animal were not sufficient, that they were perhaps compromises, compromises between forms and intensities, and that beyond becomings-animal, there were still becomings-molecular.  We had seen the famous becomings-animal that occurred in Africa. Are there not very profound historical links between certain war customs and becomings-animal, where you have this whole notion of wild-man warriors. Would there also be a relationship between becomings-animal and certain secret societies, for example, secret societies in Africa?</p><p>And finally, the third direction. This was that in these machinic assemblages, there always intervened – precisely because any arrangement put in relation units… [<em>Text interrupted</em>]</p><p>[WebDeleuze note: <em>A discussion of the notion of program follows</em>]</p><p>… The psychoanalytic operation is an operation of exchange that consists in saying: I will replace your affects with fantasies. When we talk about the psychoanalytic contract, we have to see that, by nature, it is double: there is an external contract which is the visible contract: you give me money and I listen to you; and the invisible contract: you give me your affects for the benefit of a scene of fantasy representation.</p><p><strong>Richard Pinhas</strong>: There’s no real secret about it, since Freud devoted an entire text to explaining that he was exchanging people’s lived configurations, emotions and affects for discourse and representative configurations.</p><p><strong>Deleuze</strong>: Yes, but that doesn’t prevent it from arriving at a new stage with Melanie Klein. There, the object of the exchange passes through the fantasy, whereas with Freud, it was not posed like that at all.</p><p><strong>A student</strong>: I don’t really see the distinction between fantasy and representation as long as we consider that the social machine consists in inscribing affects in a generic conceptual language.</p><p><strong>Deleuze</strong>: We all agree that there is no difference; fantasy is a kind of matrix of representation. [<em>Text interrupted</em>]</p><p>… The first thing I see is that there is always something left to cover, namely the genesis of affects. This is the way in which the molecular elements affect each other according to the positions and the variable connections that will generate the affects that run through the machinic assemblage. It is even in this way that we will be able to justify the formula: only machines are affective, it is the machines that are affective. They are not representations of something, they are affective and they are programs of affects.</p><p>The second thing is that the signs of affect are indeed like indices of representation from which one induces [<em>indistinct words</em>]. Here, I am less sure of what I’m saying because if we take up again [<em>indistinct words</em>], once again, if we take up the way little Hans defines the horse, what is important for us is not the horse in general, it is the ONE horse that he programmed as part of his machinic assemblage. When he says that he has blinkers, black around his mouth, and what have you, if you separate each thing – because it is still representation, the representation of a street scene, the horse that little Hans saw dragging…  but in another way and along another line which would be the affective program of little Hans, it is already something other than a representation, namely <em>circulations of affects</em>. Little Hans won’t see a horse wearing blinkers, he will instead be affected by what he experiences as the blindness of the horse, the active blindness of the horse as it is caused by man. And here, we are no longer in the domain of representation. If you separate the elements, you will say that each one refers to a representation. But if you establish the circulation in terms of this mystery, you will ask how little Hans makes an affect circulate, how he passes from one affect to another. For example, an essential problem, it seems to me, in little Hans’s assemblage is: does the horse bite because it has fallen or for some other reason? What is the affect that is transformed into biting?</p><p>If we transform this in terms of fantasies, you see that the answer is the psychoanalytic answer, namely that “making noise with his feet” refers to the primal scene, to the fantasy representation of the primal scene. Previously we said that as far as we were concerned, we didn’t give a damn about all that, that the machinic assemblage was completely sexual in itself and had nothing to do with a fantasy. At that point, it is enough to reintroduce the movement of affects in the machinic assemblage so that it becomes the programming of this assemblage where nothing is exactly a representative index anymore, although, at each moment, if you make a cut, at such and such a moment, you reduce things to signs of representation.</p><p>So, I believe that it would be necessary to introduce a double point of view because it is true that it is, in the last instance, molecular relations that account for the distribution of affects in a machinic assemblage, while, at another level, it is the machinic assemblage that causes molecular lines, becomings-molecular or at least becomings-animal to take flight. It is in this sense that I ask the question: wouldn’t the becoming-animal still be a compromise?</p><p>The becoming-animal, however fascinating it may be and whatever it is used for… here I  again take up the example of the war machine: in the war machine in general, there is indeed a notion of becoming-animal. I take again the example of the wild-man warrior. And then there is something else, in the war machine there is not only the notion of becoming-animal, there is also a kind of becoming-molecular, like a kind of molecular line. This is at the level of a consistent machine: the war machine. But at the level of the scientific machine and its possible unities with the war machine, the becomings-molecular will perhaps represent a kind of becoming that, in terms of intensities or in terms of deterritorialization, goes much further than the becoming-animal.</p><p>We can present things in two ways: either we can say that finally, what happens at the level of machinic assemblages is a kind of intensive continuum. There is an intensive continuum or, instead of there being forms separated from one another, there is a transformation, a passage from one form to another through intensive continuity, which does not prevent us from marking the thresholds of this continuity. For example, I can very well present the relation of becoming-animal and the relation of becoming-molecular in the form of an intensive continuum. Here I take a classic example: the double aspect in science fiction where we have a certain notion of becoming-animal, and the way in which the becoming-animal is relayed by something that goes even further, namely a becoming-molecular. We can say that there is a kind of intensive continuum on which we can stagger the becoming-animal and the becoming-molecular, and there is a passage, a kind of threshold, the crossing of a gradient. If we reintroduce in one way or another the notion of form, however, we will find ourselves back in this business of analogies, homologies and structures.</p><p>On the other hand, as long as you stick to the notion of a program, it doesn’t bother me. There is an intensive continuum of substance where a threshold is crossed. For example, here I come back to my example: in terms of the question of transplants or eggs, it is quite simple: something that was destined to become the caudal appendage of the newt, for example, is displaced. What does it mean to “shift on an egg”? It means: to graft upon a region of a different intensity. Instead of becoming a caudal appendage, it produces something else; precisely, a threshold has been crossed through migration. Through migration, which is to say that,  in the very egg itself, a process of deterritorialization is inscribed, since a part that was normally destined to become such a thing at such a threshold of intensity, will, by means of migration, now produce something else; there is a crossing of a threshold. Here, I can say that the forms are not important, that what determines these forms as a secondary product from the point of view of representation, are purely the migrations. And by migrations I do not at all mean migrations in terms of spatial extension, I mean in terms of changes in intensity.</p><p>I would say, on the other hand, that this intensive continuum can be expressed in another way. There are even three ways of expressing it, and these three ways are like three coordinates of a machinic assemblage. We can say that there are no more forms, that instead there is an intensive continuum of substances… [<em>End</em> of <em>first part; second part missing</em>]</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p><p><a href=https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-03-13/#_ednref1 rel=noopener>1</a> Let us note that this sentence seems to contradict the previous statements.
