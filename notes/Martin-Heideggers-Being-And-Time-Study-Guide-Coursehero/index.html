In it, Heidegger rethinks the &ldquo;meaning of being&rdquo; in a way that places humans and their experience of the world front and center. He challenges traditional western theories of being, including those of the ancient Greeks, and suggests that any full account of what it means to &ldquo;be&rdquo; must include an account of what it means to be human, as opposed to what it means to &ldquo;be&rdquo; a rock or a cloud, for example.</p><p>In the second half of the book, Heidegger turns to the question of how Dasein—the special kind of being possessed by humans—interacts with the concept of time. To Heidegger, Dasein is not merely a quality, like height or age: it is fundamental enough that in many ways it &ldquo;is&rdquo; the person. Accordingly, Heidegger will often focus on what &ldquo;Dasein is&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dasein does,&rdquo; phrases which can be interpreted as referring to the instance of Dasein possessed by any given person. He argues that time serves as a &ldquo;horizon&rdquo; of human possibilities and that mortality marks the border beyond which Dasein is &ldquo;impossible.&rdquo; In order to live authentically, he contends, one must take into account the temporality of one&rsquo;s existence. <em>Being and Time</em> was influential—and controversial—in its time, at least partly because it proposed such a sweeping change of direction for ontology (the philosophical study of being). It remains one of the cornerstone works of this discipline.</p><a href=#about-the-title><h3 id=about-the-title><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>About the Title</h3></a><p><em>Being and Time</em> is a treatise on _ontology—_the philosophical study of being. In the course of examining the &ldquo;meaning of being,&rdquo; Heidegger concludes that being, as humans understand and experience it, is fundamentally related to time. He thus treats the relationship between the two concepts as an essential part of his ontological theory.</p><hr><a href=#main-ideas><h1 id=main-ideas><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Main Ideas</h1></a><a href=#dasein-as-the-basis-for-ontological-inquiry><h2 id=dasein-as-the-basis-for-ontological-inquiry><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Dasein as the Basis for Ontological Inquiry</h2></a><p>A cornerstone of <em>Being and Time</em> is the contention that the &ldquo;meaning of being&rdquo; can best be understood by investigating a specific kind of being called <em>Dasein</em> (literally, &ldquo;being there&rdquo;). This is the kind of being that human beings have, complete with its attendant qualities of self-awareness and temporality. Heidegger&rsquo;s emphasis on Dasein represents an inversion of the traditional priorities of western ontological thought, which has tended to treat human &ldquo;being&rdquo; as an atypical case. In systems such as those of the ancient Greeks or the Scholastics, the being that humans experience is a watered-down version of a timeless and more fundamental kind of being. The Greek philosopher Plato, for example, held that people, animals, and objects were mere reflections of eternal, transcendent &ldquo;Forms&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ideas.&rdquo; The Scholastics, an influential group of medieval Christian philosophers, considered God to possess a kind of existence both higher than and different from that of humans.</p><p>A parallel tradition, which Heidegger also rejects, treats human beings as exceptional on the premise that they enjoy a richer plenitude, or abundance, of existence than, say, inanimate objects. From the Platonic and Scholastic perspectives, humans &ldquo;are&rdquo; too little to serve as a basis for ontological thinking because they are temporal and imperfect; from this other viewpoint, humans are an inappropriate focus for ontology because they are endowed with self-consciousness and, some would argue, free will. Heidegger, however, denies that &ldquo;being&rdquo; is merely a single property that rocks, plants, and animals all share with humans. He is thus less concerned with, for instance, the fact that humans can think and rocks cannot.</p><p>Heidegger&rsquo;s view is that human being, Dasein, is not only the proper but the <em>only</em> vantage point from which to launch an ontological investigation. In the introductory chapters of <em>Being and Time</em>, he raises the point that humans invariably understand their world in terms of its usefulness (or uselessness) for preserving human existence. For him, this is not a surmountable flaw but a fundamental feature of the system: whatever sort of &ldquo;being&rdquo; a hammer possesses will be encountered only in terms of its relevance to a human task (e.g., driving nails or prying open a box). This quality of purpose or relevance is not an &ldquo;extra&rdquo; interpretive layer that needs to be peeled back to get at the truth about objective reality. That is, things do not exist neutrally and then become useful: Dasein encounters them as useful (or potentially so) and only with effort comes to see them &ldquo;neutrally.&rdquo; Dasein&rsquo;s goal-orientedness and its projection onto the world must be included in any attempt to account for the being of &ldquo;mere&rdquo; objects.</p><p>Although Heidegger insists that Dasein is ultimately undefinable, he does his best to enumerate, or list, and explain its most important qualities. One of these, treated below, is <em>being-in-the-world</em>—the idea that Dasein is not a disembodied consciousness, but a type of being that is already embedded in reality. Another attribute of Dasein discussed at length is &ldquo;mineness,&rdquo; the fact that Dasein is always a &ldquo;my&rdquo; being for some value of &ldquo;me&rdquo;—it is never neutral or subjectless. Other traits include &ldquo;care,&rdquo; the existential concern or anxiety with which Dasein attends to the objects and activities of its world, and &ldquo;temporality,&rdquo; Dasein&rsquo;s necessary—though sometimes unconscious—relationship to time. The extant portions of <em>Being and Time</em> can be read more or less as a guide to Dasein: its properties, its perspective, and its legitimacy as a basis for ontological inquiry.</p><a href=#being-in-the-world><h2 id=being-in-the-world><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Being-in-the-World</h2></a><p>Central to Dasein is the notion of &ldquo;being-in-the-world,&rdquo; a topic that is analyzed extensively throughout Division 1 of <em>Being and Time</em>. For convenience, Heidegger breaks this ultimately undivided relation down into three parts: Dasein, being-in, and world. Dasein—the ultimately undefinable but broadly characterizable &ldquo;being&rdquo; that human beings have—is the main object of Heidegger&rsquo;s quest. To this end, both the nature of the &ldquo;being-in&rdquo; relation—its fundamental inescapability as long as Dasein persists—and the nature of the &ldquo;world&rdquo; are examined at length. Throughout, Heidegger emphasizes the subjective and interactive aspects of being-in-the-world, rejecting the idea of an atomic—not reducible any further—self set loose in an independent, preexistent world.</p><p>For Heidegger, Dasein is &ldquo;thrown into&rdquo; the world, and this &ldquo;thrownness&rdquo; determines Dasein&rsquo;s responses to its experiences. All its information about itself, all its self-knowledge and self-awareness, is mediated by the fact of its being-in-the-world. It follows that every other basic trait of Dasein can be related to being-in-the-world. Dasein&rsquo;s constitutive—of what Dasein is made up of—quality of &ldquo;care,&rdquo; for example, is expressed in the everyday dealings required to live life in the world. Its emotions and its understanding are always responses to a world in which it has always already &ldquo;found itself.&rdquo; Likewise, Heidegger repeatedly notes that Dasein, in everyday life, tends toward &ldquo;averageness&rdquo; and inauthenticity, escaping into authenticity only rarely and with difficulty. This tendency, he argues, stems from the fact that Dasein is, for the most part, preoccupied with the world in which it finds itself and thus susceptible to the influence of others. There is no secure way for Dasein to retreat from &ldquo;the world,&rdquo; or from the imperious, impersonal &ldquo;they&rdquo; of society.</p><p>In developing his view of being-in-the-world, Heidegger specifically rejects the dualisms of past philosophers—not just self versus world, but also mind versus body—as insufficient. Unlike Descartes, one of his major rhetorical sparring partners in <em>Being and Time</em>, Heidegger does not consider the thinking subject to be something separate from the world it regards. Indeed, he does not even consider the statement &ldquo;Dasein regards the world,&rdquo; with its distinction between subject and object, to accurately capture the situation. Instead of watching from the sidelines, Dasein is more like a player in the middle of the game, with no memory of ever <em>not</em> being in the game. Because Dasein cannot get &ldquo;out of&rdquo; the world or even really imagine such a state, it does not make any sense, to Heidegger, to adhere to a concept of self that acknowledges a distinction between mind and body. Everything Dasein can say about its &ldquo;mind&rdquo; comes from experiences that blur such lines.</p><a href=#being-toward-death><h2 id=being-toward-death><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Being-Toward-Death</h2></a><p>For Heidegger, the inextricability of being and time leads naturally to a consideration of mortality, a subject explored in depth in Division 2, Chapter 1. It is characteristic of Dasein to be aware of the possibility, but not the necessity, of its own existence—to realize, in other words, that nonexistence is possible and even inevitable. The &ldquo;care&rdquo; that Heidegger sees as constitutive of Dasein emerges from this awareness; nothing provokes this care as acutely as death, which Heidegger refers to as the &ldquo;possibility of the impossibility&rdquo; of Dasein. On a more practical level, Heidegger&rsquo;s view of death includes some fairly uncontroversial ideas (e.g., its inevitability; the uncertainty of its timing) and some ideas that are perhaps more debatable, such as the claim that no one can relate to death through the deaths of others.</p><p><em>Being-toward-death</em> is Heidegger&rsquo;s term for a way of being that takes death into account. Morbid though the phrase may sound, Heidegger considers this kind of death-awareness to be liberating and enlivening—and even, in a sense, ecstatic. Being-toward-death means living life forward, not flinching or turning away from the horizon toward which all life ultimately leads. It is emphatically not a depressive preoccupation with death, a macabre fascination, or a suicidal desire to hurry it along, but rather a salutary facing of facts. It is no accident that for Heidegger, the discussion of being-toward-death goes hand-in-hand with another possibility of Dasein: that of &ldquo;being-a-whole.&rdquo; Arriving at wholeness in one&rsquo;s lifetime means reckoning with one&rsquo;s mortality.</p><p>The reason to adopt this orientation, Heidegger suggests—to bother facing this most uncomfortable of facts—is that it allows people to live authentically. In Heidegger&rsquo;s view, people who act as though they are going to live forever are living in a fundamentally inauthentic way because they are denying something fundamental about human existence. Heidegger&rsquo;s German word for authenticity, <em>Eigentlichkeit</em>, carries an additional connotation of self-ownership; indeed, he argues that to live authentically is to take ownership of one&rsquo;s life, including its finitude.</p><hr><a href=#context><h1 id=context><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Context</h1></a><a href=#the-question-of-being><h2 id=the-question-of-being><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Question of Being</h2></a><p>Since at least the time of the Greek philosopher 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Being-and-Time/key-figure-analysis/#Plato rel=noopener>Plato</a> (428/27–348/47 BCE), western philosophy has been continually preoccupied with the question &ldquo;What does it mean to be?&rdquo; The attempts to answer this question constitute the field of <em>ontology</em>, the philosophical study of existence. The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384–322 BCE), Plato&rsquo;s student and founder of the Lyceum school, gave what is arguably the first sustained discussion of the question in his <em>Metaphysics</em> (c. 350 BCE). In this famously forbidding and difficult work, Aristotle tried to get at the core of &ldquo;being qua being&rdquo;—being considered in its own right. That is, he wanted to study being apart from any &ldquo;extras&rdquo; that might pertain only to people, creatures, or inanimate things. He partitioned the problem of being into subsidiary issues of <em>matter</em> and <em>form</em>, concluding that of the two, <em>form</em> was the more fundamental—the real basis of being. This doctrine presenting the duality of matter and form provided the basis of philosophical discussion.</p><p>Medieval and early modern ontological studies—those conducted up from roughly the 6th through the 17th century in the West—were shaped by the tenets of Christianity. This was true even for individual skeptics like Dutch-Jewish Baruch Spinoza (1632–77), who rejected the conclusions of Christianity but continued to adopt many of its premises. For the Scholastics—those medieval philosophers whose tradition reached its pinnacle with Italian theologian Thomas Aquinas (c. 1224–74)—God was the paragon of &ldquo;being.&rdquo; Early modern continental thinkers such as French philosopher 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Being-and-Time/key-figure-analysis/#Ren%C3%A9_Descartes rel=noopener>René Descartes</a> (1596–1650) and Spinoza continued to posit a special quality of being enjoyed by God, as contrasted with the being of created things. Descartes, as part of a highly influential system of ontological categories, contended that the gulf between an uncreated God and created human beings was so wide that, ultimately, the two could not be indicated by the same sense of &ldquo;to be.&rdquo; Spinoza argued instead for <em>Deus sive Natura</em> (&ldquo;God or Nature&rdquo;), an impersonal God that was equivalent to Nature (i.e., the physical world). To Spinoza, the universe consisted of a single substance: people, animals, and objects were only <em>apparently</em> separate.</p><p>For 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Being-and-Time/author/ rel=noopener>Martin Heidegger</a> none of these accounts of being were satisfactory. These earlier philosophers, he charged, had centered their ontologies on God in a way that made human &ldquo;beings&rdquo; seem derivative and secondary. A more appropriate approach, Heidegger argued, would be to begin with human &ldquo;being&rdquo; (which Heidegger calls <em>Dasein</em>, literally &ldquo;being there&rdquo;) and work outward. Dasein, he posits, is not like the being of a rock that just happens to be self-aware; that is, it cannot be reached by starting from the being of mere objects and then tacking on consciousness as an extra attribute. Rather, Heidegger argued that the being of nonhuman beings (e.g., objects) could be better understood from within the framework of Dasein. He considered it futile to start his ontological quest by trying to define &ldquo;being&rdquo; in a way that would apply equally to people, dogs, rocks, and textbooks.</p><a href=#modern-philosophical-influences><h2 id=modern-philosophical-influences><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Modern Philosophical Influences</h2></a><p>Heidegger had similar, if subtler, points of disagreement with the various modern philosophers who approached &ldquo;the question of being.&rdquo; Several 18th- and 19th-century thinkers make at least cameo appearances in <em>Being and Time</em>, but perhaps the most central modern figures mentioned in the work are German philosophers 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Being-and-Time/key-figure-analysis/#Immanuel_Kant rel=noopener>Immanuel Kant</a> (1724–1804) and 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Being-and-Time/key-figure-analysis/#Edmund_Husserl rel=noopener>Edmund Husserl</a> (1859–1938). Kant, a thinker widely regarded as the first great western philosopher of the modern era, shared with Heidegger (and may to some extent have bequeathed to him) an interest in &ldquo;the individual.&rdquo; Kant famously disdained ontology, however, which he viewed as grounded in unprovable premises.</p><p>Outside academic circles, Kant is well known for his refutation of the <em>ontological argument</em>, a traditional argument for the existence of God that rests on what Kant regards the apparent absurdity of a perfect, yet nonexistent being. The argument for the existence of God was advanced in various forms by the Scholastics and Descartes and was a mainstay of Christian philosophy for centuries. Yet although Heidegger is allied with Kant inasmuch as both reject Descartes&rsquo;s ontology, he does not share Kant&rsquo;s broader skepticism as to the relevance or methodical soundness of ontology overall. From a historical lens, much of Heidegger&rsquo;s work can be regarded as an attempt, by returning to the barest of fundamentals, to rescue ontology from both the naivete (as Heidegger saw it) of Descartes and the pessimism of Kant. Heidegger raised some challenges to Kant&rsquo;s point of view in <em>Being and Time</em>. He resumed and extended his critique in a later volume, <em>Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics</em> (1929), which is sometimes viewed as a follow-up work to <em>Being and Time</em>.</p><p>Edmund Husserl is most widely known for his work on <em>phenomenology</em>, the philosophical study of subjectively experienced phenomena. For example, &ldquo;How much do our experiences tell us about the world, and how much do they say about our own minds?&rdquo; is a fundamental phenomenological question. A student of Husserl&rsquo;s work in this area, Heidegger served as his assistant at Freiburg before his time at Marburg, then returned roughly a decade later to assume the post vacated by the elder philosopher&rsquo;s retirement. Unsurprisingly given their close professional relationship, Husserl&rsquo;s legacy is evident throughout Heidegger&rsquo;s work, which emphasizes phenomenology from an early stage as a pathway to ontology. In <em>Being and Time</em> the most sustained discussion of phenomenology as such appears in Chapter 2 of the Introduction. For Heidegger, however, phenomenology remains a means to an end: attending to phenomena is a preliminary way to get at certain aspects of being. He is more apt to classify it as a method than as a separate branch of philosophy on par with logic or ethics. Husserl, as evidenced in his groundbreaking <em>Logical Investigations</em> (1900–01), was more deeply concerned with the relationship between phenomena and reality and sought to promote phenomenology as a distinct philosophical discipline.</p><a href=#heideggers-influence><h2 id=heideggers-influence><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Heidegger&rsquo;s Influence</h2></a><p>Although he continued to teach and write until shortly before his death in 1976, Heidegger remains best known for <em>Being and Time</em>, and the concepts introduced in this book constitute his legacy to mainstream western philosophy. Though he rejected the label of &ldquo;existentialist,&rdquo; Heidegger was particularly influential in that mid-20th-century movement, whose literary and philosophical writings focused on the individual and the crises provoked by individual self-awareness. Fear and dread—of the unknown, of death, even of embracing one&rsquo;s full potential—were common themes in existentialist literature and common topics in existentialist philosophy.</p><p>In a sense, almost every major idea popularly associated with existentialism can be found in <em>Being and Time</em>: Heidegger&rsquo;s foregrounding of individual, subjective experience in the concept of Dasein anticipates the stress laid by existentialists on the self and its feelings in both philosophical discussion and in the literature of poetry, stories, novels, and plays. Heidegger&rsquo;s concept of &ldquo;care&rdquo; (<em>Sorge</em> in German), and his emphasis on &ldquo;fear&rdquo; and &ldquo;dread&rdquo; (<em>Angst</em>) as elements of the human experience, find expression in the angst and anxiety often explored in existentialist works. Even existentialist French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre&rsquo;s (1905–80) famous declaration that &ldquo;hell is other people&rdquo; can arguably be identified with Heidegger&rsquo;s discussion of the self versus &ldquo;the they&rdquo; (<em>das Man</em>) in 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Being-and-Time/division-1-chapter-4-summary/ rel=noopener>Division 1, Chapter 4</a>. There, Heidegger describes the &ldquo;everyday&rdquo; self as suppressed, even suffocated, by the demands of society. Pre-Heideggerian examples of the angst-ridden self trapped in &ldquo;everydayness&rdquo; can be found in the writings of Bohemian, German-language author Franz Kafka (1883–1924).</p><p>Heidegger was not the only philosopher to lay the groundwork for existentialism. Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900), a fellow German, and Danish thinker Søren Kierkegaard (1813–55) both shared Heidegger&rsquo;s emphasis on individuality and subjectivity, and the writings of both can be considered wellsprings of the existentialist movement. Still, even when they began from different premises, the major existentialists often reached conclusions similar to Heidegger&rsquo;s. French author and founder of absurdism, a branch of existentialism, Albert Camus&rsquo;s (1913–60) <em>Myth of Sisyphus</em> (1942), for instance, conceptualizes the world as a fundamentally absurd and meaningless place in which the search for meaning is at once futile and necessary. Camus&rsquo;s philosophy is rather less optimistic than Heidegger&rsquo;s, but it leads to the same place: an embrace of freedom and authenticity.</p><hr><a href=#key-figures><h1 id=key-figures><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span> Key Figures</h1></a><table><thead><tr><th>Key Figure</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>René Descartes</td><td>French philosopher René Descartes (1596–1650) was a major early modern thinker best known for his <em>Meditations on First Philosophy</em> (1641) and for his theory of mind-body dualism that is sometimes called &ldquo;Cartesian dualism.&rdquo;

<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Being-and-Time/key-figure-analysis/#Plato rel=noopener>Plato</a> who claims that defining the word <em>being</em> is no easy task. Heidegger believes the answer to the question of what is meant by the word <em>being</em> has never been fully answered. He sets out to &ldquo;raise anew the question of the meaning of being&rdquo; and answer this very question in the text.</p><a href=#introduction><h3 id=introduction><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Introduction</h3></a><p>In an untitled preface and two introductory chapters, Heidegger introduces the &ldquo;question of being&rdquo; and argues that it has been overlooked—even forgotten—by philosophers for millennia. At worst, he says, thinkers have taken the question of being for granted and used it as a core element of their philosophies without attempting to define it. He proposes to &ldquo;recover&rdquo; this question and, from there, launch into a detailed investigation of what it means &ldquo;to be.&rdquo; Given the scope of the work he has in mind, it is not surprising that Heidegger would spend a few chapters just sketching out his plan. Notably, however, Heidegger lays out a plan for a much longer work than he ended up writing. He conceives a sprawling, multivolume treatise with six major &ldquo;Divisions,&rdquo; but only the first two divisions of the book were completed and published.</p><a href=#division-1><h3 id=division-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Division 1</h3></a><p>Heidegger critiques, but does not wholly reject, the ontological theories of past philosophers. He argues the merits—indeed, the necessity—of conceptualizing &ldquo;being&rdquo; as subjective and phenomenological. That is, he treats <em>Dasein</em>, the kind of &ldquo;being&rdquo; that humans have—not mere &ldquo;objective presence&rdquo; such as a rock possesses—as his fundamental starting point. The first two chapters of this division provide a detailed exposition of the meaning of <em>Dasein</em> and an examination of the related concept of &ldquo;being-in-the-world.&rdquo; In Chapter 3 Heidegger dives into the concept of the &ldquo;world&rdquo; in which &ldquo;being-in-the-world&rdquo; takes place; in the process, he critiques past attempts to establish an ontology in which other types of being have primacy. Chapter 4 explores the relation of Dasein to &ldquo;the they,&rdquo; the others that a self encounters in the world. Then, Heidegger turns to the concept of &ldquo;being-in&rdquo; and remarks on the emotional and subjective quality of finding oneself &ldquo;thrown into&rdquo; the world in Chapter 5. A sixth and final chapter develops and defends Heidegger&rsquo;s earlier assertion that &ldquo;care&rdquo; (in the sense of concern or attentiveness) is the essence of Dasein.</p><a href=#division-2><h3 id=division-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Division 2</h3></a><p>Having sketched out some essential characteristics of being, Heidegger turns his attention to time. In Chapter 1 he addresses the problem of temporality, which forms a kind of &ldquo;horizon&rdquo; for Dasein because a human life is always a mortal one. He argues that time is fundamental to Dasein and, in a sense, <em>is</em> Dasein. Just as &ldquo;being-in-the-world&rdquo; means more than occupying some position in three-dimensional space, &ldquo;being&rdquo; in time means more than simply occupying a position on the axis of time. The concept of &ldquo;being-towards-death,&rdquo; being aware of one&rsquo;s mortality, is enunciated and examined, leading to a consideration of authentic and inauthentic modes of being. The issue of authenticity is carried forward into Chapters 2 and 3, where it is related to notions of conscience and selfhood, respectively. In Chapter 4 temporality is connected to the idea of &ldquo;everydayness,&rdquo; and in Chapters 5 and 6, this connection is used to explain the origins of the &ldquo;vulgar&rdquo; (i.e., common or commonsensical) notions of history and time, as well as why these notions are unsatisfactory. Intended to be part of a much longer work, <em>Being and Time</em> ends somewhat abruptly with a provocative question: &ldquo;Does <em>time</em> reveal itself as the horizon of <em>being</em>?&rdquo;</p><hr><a href=#front-page--summary><h1 id=front-page--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Front Page | Summary</h1></a><a href=#key-takeaways><h2 id=key-takeaways><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Key Takeaways</h2></a><ul><li><em>Being and Time</em> begins with a single untitled page in which a line from <em>Sophist</em>, by the ancient Greek philosopher Plato, is presented first in Greek, then in translation.</li><li>The quoted line makes the point that the word &ldquo;being&rdquo; is by no means trivial to define, even though people widely use it as though they know just what it means.</li><li>Heidegger asks: &ldquo;Do we &mldr; have an answer to the question of what we really mean by the word &lsquo;being&rsquo;?&rdquo; He answers no, and proposes to &ldquo;raise anew the question of the meaning of being.&rdquo;</li><li>Because the concept of being is used so uncritically—not only in everyday life but also in philosophy—Heidegger argues that it will first be necessary to define the question.</li><li>To that end, he offers two subsequent chapters of &ldquo;introductory remarks.&rdquo;</li></ul><hr><a href=#introduction-chapter-1--the-necessity-structure-and-priority-of-the-question-of-being--summary><h1 id=introduction-chapter-1--the-necessity-structure-and-priority-of-the-question-of-being--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Introduction, Chapter 1 : The Necessity, Structure, and Priority of the Question of Being | Summary</h1></a><a href=#key-takeaways-1><h2 id=key-takeaways-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Key Takeaways</h2></a><ul><li>In Section 1 Heidegger argues at great length that it is necessary to &ldquo;raise anew the question of the meaning of being&rdquo; because this fundamental question has been overlooked since the time of the ancient Greeks.</li><li>Worse, he says, philosophers from Aristotle to the Middle Ages and beyond have deliberately neglected the question of being. Their &ldquo;prejudices&rdquo; have allowed them to ignore the question by asserting the concept of being is obvious, indefinable, or self-evident.</li><li>In Section 2 Heidegger says that formulating the &ldquo;question of being&rdquo; is challenging, because people possess only an &ldquo;average and vague understanding of being&rdquo; to begin with.</li><li>Moreover, because human beings <em>are</em> beings, working out the question of being seems to pose a danger of falling into circular reasoning. Heidegger asserts that this trap can be avoided.</li><li>Heidegger introduces the term <em>Dasein</em> to refer to the kind of being that human beings experience. Much of the remainder of the book will amount to an extremely detailed characterization of Dasein, but for now, little is said about the meaning of this term.</li><li>Although Heidegger never offers a single, authoritative definition of the concept, Dasein will be shown to entail several related attributes or aspects, such as self-consciousness, goal-orientedness, and a drive toward self preservation.</li><li>Heidegger continues in Section 3 with the argument that the question of being is important in ways more fundamental than (&ldquo;ontologically prior&rdquo; is how he phrases it) other philosophical inquiry, as well as to the natural and social sciences, the humanities, and theology. A concept of being is presupposed in each of these disciplines, and clarifying the meaning of being is therefore a relevant task to each field.</li><li>In Section 4 Heidegger makes a first pass at characterizing Dasein to show why a discussion of the meaning of being can properly begin with Dasein. He observes that humans, unlike other types of beings, are curious about their own existence and anxious to preserve it. These qualities lead humans, with their unique type of being, to experience the world in a particular way. Heidegger deems it better to embrace the quirks of Dasein openly and to try to get at the rest of the world through Dasein, rather than trying to imagine existence in a way truly detached from Dasein.</li><li>This section also introduces the idea of <em>being-in-the-world</em>, which is perhaps the most fundamental property of Dasein. Dasein is not just a disembodied mind observing the world from outside: it is inextricably embedded in a world and all of its &ldquo;being&rdquo; takes place within that world.</li><li>Heidegger concludes that &ldquo;fundamental ontology &mldr; must be sought in the existential analysis of Dasein.&rdquo; Throughout the rest of <em>Being and Time</em>, Heidegger will elaborate on the concept of being by thinking &ldquo;outward,&rdquo; so to speak, from the specific kind of being that is Dasein.</li></ul><hr><a href=#introduction-chapter-2--the-double-task-in-working-out-the-question-of-being-the-method-of-the-investigation-and-its-outline--summary><h1 id=introduction-chapter-2--the-double-task-in-working-out-the-question-of-being-the-method-of-the-investigation-and-its-outline--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Introduction, Chapter 2 : The Double Task in Working Out the Question of Being: The Method of the Investigation and Its Outline | Summary</h1></a><a href=#key-takeaways-2><h2 id=key-takeaways-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Key Takeaways</h2></a><ul><li>In section 5 Heidegger turns to the <em>Time</em> in &ldquo;<em>Being and Time</em>.&rdquo; He explains that Dasein, the fundamental starting point for his ontology, unfolds in time. To put it plainly but a little reductively, or oversimplified, humans live in time and experience themselves and the world in temporal terms, so any ontology that places human &ldquo;being&rdquo; at the center must also account for time.</li><li>This emphasis on time is a key difference between Heidegger&rsquo;s ontology and the many prior ontological theories. For philosophers from ancient Greece to the 18th century, ontology was a topic to be treated separately from time. &ldquo;To be,&rdquo; in their view, was not necessarily or fundamentally &ldquo;to be in time.&rdquo;</li><li>An early example of this kind of ontological thinking occurs in Plato&rsquo;s theory of forms. According to this theory, the true reality is a set of eternal ideas of which temporal objects and people are merely imperfect, perishable copies.</li><li>Dasein, though by no means &ldquo;foreign to itself,&rdquo; faces special difficulties in understanding and interpreting itself. Thus, even though Dasein is the centerpiece of Heidegger&rsquo;s ontology, it won&rsquo;t do to rely on naive human conjecture about &ldquo;what it means to be.&rdquo;</li><li>Instead, the specific characteristics of Dasein&rsquo;s understanding—including its self-understanding—need to be investigated. One such characteristic, and a main reason not to take naive self-observations at face value, is Dasein&rsquo;s tendency to be caught up in &ldquo;average everydayness&rdquo; rather than profound reflection.</li><li>By &ldquo;everydayness,&rdquo; Heidegger means the socially conditioned, distracted, not-particularly-astute mode of being in which people go about their everyday lives. From the vantage point of everydayness, the world can seem simpler than it does when carefully and deliberately examined.</li><li>In Section 6 Heidegger proposes a &ldquo;destruction&rdquo; of the history of ontology, or of the prior systems of ontological thinking that continue to direct modern philosophy. The term <em>destruction</em> suggests somewhat more violence and antipathy than Heidegger displays, and his activity here could perhaps more aptly be labeled &ldquo;deconstruction&rdquo; or &ldquo;unraveling.&rdquo;</li><li>Heidegger argues that ancient Greek attempts to understand the human condition led to a narrow and rigid vocabulary that fails to capture the real questions of ontology. Throughout their philosophy, the Greeks emphasized <em>logos</em>, which means &ldquo;reason&rdquo; but also implies a discourse. This emphasis has been taken unquestioningly as an element of subsequent western ontology.</li><li>Heidegger turns to the relationship between ontology and phenomenology in Section 7. Traditionally, these two have been seen as distinct areas of philosophy: ontology tells about what <em>is</em>, and phenomenology describes &ldquo;what shows itself&rdquo; in experience and sensation. Heidegger argues that this distinction is illusory and that an investigation of phenomena can lead to an understanding of being.</li><li>This is a point on which Heidegger diverges from his teacher and onetime collaborator Edmund Husserl. What is at issue here is not whether phenomena say something about the world, or even whether they display apparently regular and reliable patterns. Heidegger&rsquo;s contention is that phenomena are an acceptable basis not just for predicting whether the sun will rise tomorrow, or for deriving a law of gravitation, but also for making claims about the fundamental and universal characteristics of being.</li><li>In Section 8 Heidegger presents an outline for his planned treatise, which is to constitute six divisions in two parts. Only the first two divisions—approximately a third of the work as originally envisioned—were in fact published.</li></ul><hr><a href=#division-1-chapter-1--the-exposition-of-the-task-of-a-preparatory-analysis-of-dasein--summary><h1 id=division-1-chapter-1--the-exposition-of-the-task-of-a-preparatory-analysis-of-dasein--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Division 1, Chapter 1 : The Exposition of the Task of a Preparatory Analysis of Dasein | Summary</h1></a><a href=#key-takeaways-3><h2 id=key-takeaways-3><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Key Takeaways</h2></a><ul><li>With the groundwork for his approach laid in the previous two chapters, in Section 9 Heidegger launches into a more extensive attempt to characterize Dasein. Making use of language from medieval philosophy, he argues that &ldquo;the essence&rdquo; of Dasein &ldquo;is existence.&rdquo; Although this language has a rich tradition of definitional debates, one point Heidegger makes here is that Dasein is neither outside the world nor merely a &ldquo;thing&rdquo; in the world, like a rock or a table.</li><li>The other major property of Dasein introduced here is &ldquo;mineness&rdquo; (<em>Jemeinigkeit</em> in German). Dasein is always the Dasein of a &ldquo;me,&rdquo; a self. This is closely connected to ideas of &ldquo;authenticity&rdquo; (<em>Eigentlichkeit</em> in German)—in the sense of self-understanding and self-ownership—and its opposite, &ldquo;inauthenticity.&rdquo; To live authentically means to take ownership of the &ldquo;my&rdquo; of being, as Dasein provides the sense of &ldquo;my&rdquo; with a specific and concrete experience of the world. Although Heidegger here attempts to use &ldquo;authentic&rdquo; and &ldquo;inauthentic&rdquo; in a value-neutral way, the latter half of the book will make strong arguments for the merits of the authentic life.</li><li>As further preparation for his &ldquo;preparatory analysis,&rdquo; Heidegger introduces another matched pair of terms: &ldquo;categories&rdquo; and &ldquo;existentials.&rdquo; The word <em>category</em> functions in something like its ordinary sense; it represents a label, or a sorting mechanism, applied essentially for human convenience.</li><li>Heidegger&rsquo;s assertion here is that categories apply to entities other than Dasein, whereas existentials are &ldquo;characteristics of being of Dasein&rdquo; and apply only to it. &ldquo;Cup,&rdquo; for example—not from Heidegger—is a category to which the legend of the Holy Grail belongs; &ldquo;self-awareness&rdquo; is an existential. Another way to see the difference is that things <em>belong</em> to categories, whereas Dasein is <em>constituted</em> or even <em>defined</em> by existentials but does not belong to them.</li><li>In Section 10 Heidegger returns to, and develops, his claim that ontology (and thus the study of Dasein) is more fundamental than &ldquo;anthropology, psychology, and biology&rdquo;—that is, than other organized attempts at human self-understanding. He shows how something like a concept of being is taken for granted in the works of other modern thinkers.</li><li>The argument from Section 10 continues in Section 11 with the further observation that although some human sciences—say, anthropology—can supply information about &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; expressions of Dasein, this is not the same thing as capturing Dasein &ldquo;in its everydayness.&rdquo; Heidegger reiterates the point that these sciences are limited by failure to investigate, on a fundamental level, the meaning of being.</li></ul><hr><a href=#division-1-chapter-2--being-in-the-world-in-general-as-the-fundamental-constitution-of-dasein--summary><h1 id=division-1-chapter-2--being-in-the-world-in-general-as-the-fundamental-constitution-of-dasein--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Division 1, Chapter 2 : Being-in-the-World in General as the Fundamental Constitution of Dasein | Summary</h1></a><a href=#key-takeaways-4><h2 id=key-takeaways-4><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Key Takeaways</h2></a><ul><li>The concept of <em>being-in-the-world</em> is analyzed into its component parts in Section 12: the <em>being</em> (Dasein) who participates in it, the <em>world</em>, and the activity of <em>being-in</em>.</li><li>In this section the focus is on <em>being-in</em>, meaning roughly the nature of the connection between Dasein and the world.

Ordinary existence carries the possibility of being &ldquo;not myself,&rdquo; most typically in the sense of having limited self-awareness. Pushed about by the demands of others or pursued by one&rsquo;s own anxieties, one can fall out of touch with oneself in a way that dampens one&rsquo;s awareness of even <em>being</em> a self.</li><li>In Section 26 Heidegger points out that Dasein invariably encounters others in the world—namely, other people—who are neither useful things nor merely objectively present objects. The Dasein of these &ldquo;innerworldly&rdquo; beings—they are part of &ldquo;my&rdquo; world, and &ldquo;I&rdquo; am perhaps part of theirs—is termed &ldquo;Dasein-with&rdquo; (<em>Mitdasein</em> in German). Dasein understands itself primarily in terms of its world, and other people are a necessarily conspicuous, or noticeable, part of the world as Dasein goes about its various activities.</li><li>Various relations of Dasein to others are distinguished, including &ldquo;concern&rdquo; (<em>Fürsorge</em> in German), which is etymologically related to &ldquo;care&rdquo; in German and denotes a care &ldquo;for&rdquo; others. Empathy and inconsiderateness are noted as two points on a continuum of possible ways of &ldquo;being-with-others.&rdquo;</li><li>Section 27 poses a new definition: the others with whom one shares the world constitute &ldquo;the They&rdquo; (<em>das Man</em> in German), and their impersonal, collective expectations shape the individual Dasein. In responding to these demands, everyday Dasein succumbs to &ldquo;averageness&rdquo; and &ldquo;inauthenticity&rdquo; (<em>Uneigentlichkeit</em> in German). In day-to-day life, Dasein becomes a &ldquo;they-self&rdquo;—a self deformed by social expectations—rather than an authentic self. The &ldquo;self-ownership&rdquo; gives way to a kind of collective ownership by others and a concomitant lack of freedom and responsibility.</li></ul><hr><a href=#division-1-chapter-5--being-in-as-such--summary><h1 id=division-1-chapter-5--being-in-as-such--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Division 1, Chapter 5 : Being-in as Such | Summary</h1></a><a href=#key-takeaways-7><h2 id=key-takeaways-7><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Key Takeaways</h2></a><ul><li>The discussion of <em>being-in</em>, the link between Dasein and world in the phrase &ldquo;being-in-the-world,&rdquo; is continued and deepened. Emotional aspects of this being-in are considered in depth. Based on his preliminary survey of Dasein (Chapter 1) and the world in which it exists (Chapters 2–4), Heidegger now asks, what does it mean for such a being to &ldquo;be in&rdquo; such a world?</li><li>Heidegger reiterates in Section 28 that &ldquo;care&rdquo; (<em>Sorge</em> in German)—in a sense that boils down to concerned self-regard or even anxiety over one&rsquo;s continued existence—is the fundamental aspect of being-in-the-world. He now proposes to examine some ways in which this care manifests in the world, especially in everyday life.</li><li>For one thing, Heidegger says in Section 29, Dasein is always in one mood or another. This state of &ldquo;being in a mood&rdquo; he calls &ldquo;attunement.&rdquo; These moods, and the impossibility of their total absence for Dasein, are related to Dasein&rsquo;s &ldquo;thrownness&rdquo; (<em>Geworfenheit</em> in German), its condition of being &ldquo;thrown into&rdquo; the world. Like a boat launched onto a sea that is already churning with waves, Dasein enters the world <em>in medias res</em>—a literary term for in the middle of the narrative—and is continually reacting to its environment, not least by the moods it adopts.</li><li>Self-mastery of moods, or the restraint of a mood through the use of knowledge, must not, Heidegger warns, be confused with an absence of mood (a lack of attunement). Moods are neither wholly interior to Dasein nor thrust upon it from outside. Instead, they arise from the total relation of being-in-the-world.</li><li>In Section 30 Heidegger singles out fear as an important &ldquo;mode of attunement,&rdquo; or a collection of moods that discloses Dasein&rsquo;s fundamental characteristic of care. All fear, Heidegger suggests, is ultimately fear for oneself. To be afraid on someone else&rsquo;s behalf is to be afraid of what will happen to oneself if the other person meets with the imagined adversity.</li><li>Alongside attunement, and equally fundamental, is &ldquo;understanding,&rdquo; a term Heidegger discusses in Section 31. True to form, Heidegger uses this ordinary word in a somewhat technical way; his idea of &ldquo;understanding&rdquo; embraces not just what is understood, but Dasein&rsquo;s capacity to understand itself and the world in which it finds itself. Crucially, understanding for Heidegger is always an understanding of what is possible—it always &ldquo;penetrate[s] into possibilities.&rdquo;</li><li>Because Dasein possesses—and in a sense <em>is</em>—understanding, it is &ldquo;&lsquo;more&rsquo; than it actually is.&rdquo; For example, a hiker approaching an intersection on a forest trail is, in the ordinary but reductive way of thinking, just a person at a particular point in space. However, understanding extends the person along each of the possible paths they might follow—it projects the person &ldquo;into possibilities&rdquo; and will continue to do so even after the person chooses one path or another.</li><li>Understanding, with the imaginative extension of the self that it produces, distinguishes Dasein from the mere objective presence of a rock or a river. The possession, not just of a vague general self-awareness, but of awareness of possibilities, is characteristic of Dasein and, says Heidegger, of no other type of being.</li><li>From here, Heidegger offers an account of the activity of interpretation in Section 32. Characteristically, he does not see interpretation as a separate process built on top of other forms of understanding. Dasein does not assemble a set of facts (e.g., through the senses) and then glue them together through interpretation—rather, interpretation is a core part of understanding.</li><li>If interpretation is continual, ongoing, and inextricably bound up with immediate experience, then all interpretation—and indeed all understanding—is in some sense circular. This realization is troublesome for formal structures of interpreted knowledge, such as history. Such structures are traditionally assumed to be definitive and objective, not malleable and subjective—assumptions are untenable if interpretation is doomed to be a subjective and continually changing process.</li><li>In Section 33 Heidegger states that a judgment or a &ldquo;statement&rdquo; (<em>Aussage</em> in German) can, in turn, be treated as a type of interpretation. For Heidegger, all such judgments arise from and are embedded in a context that, for Dasein, always already exists.</li><li>For instance, to say, &ldquo;The hammer is too heavy,&rdquo; is to imply a context of use in which the hammer&rsquo;s weight is relevant: &ldquo;the hammer is too heavy for me to swing [though someone else might be able to use it comfortably]&rdquo;; &ldquo;the hammer is too heavy for my present task of driving finishing nails [though it might be an appropriate weight for framing carpentry].&rdquo; There can be no &ldquo;too heavy&rdquo; without an answer to the follow-up question: &ldquo;for what?&rdquo;</li><li>After laying some further groundwork, Heidegger arrives at the following, seemingly commonsensical definition: &ldquo;[A] statement is a pointing out which communicates and defines.&rdquo; How, he asks, does this definition imply that statements are in any way interpretive? Returning to the &ldquo;hammer&rdquo; example, he shows how such a seemingly simple statement rests on an extensive array of preconceptions, not least those about the &ldquo;uses&rdquo; of the world for Dasein. What Dasein may be tempted to regard as a plain and objective assertion is, in fact, always interpretive.</li><li>A third element that goes along with attunement and understanding is discourse. By &ldquo;discourse,&rdquo; Heidegger means not language itself, but that which &ldquo;gets expressed&rdquo; in language—the ideas and feelings of a conversation, not the actual words exchanged. The argument in Section 34 is that self-expression—the tendency to express one&rsquo;s understanding and attunement (one&rsquo;s thoughts and feelings)—is as fundamental as the qualities that are being expressed.</li><li>The section closes with a return to the concept of &ldquo;the they&rdquo; and the observation that Dasein is &ldquo;thrown into&rdquo; a form of &ldquo;publicness&rdquo; inasmuch as it is thrown into a world where &ldquo;the they&rdquo; exist. Even in a small village or a tight-knit social group, there is a sort of stage on which an individual is forced to perform, a &ldquo;public&rdquo; before which the individual appears.</li><li>In Section 35 Heidegger discusses &ldquo;idle talk&rdquo; as an everyday expression of discourse. Although he does not wish to &ldquo;disparage&rdquo; idle talk, he does emphasize the epistemological problems—problems of what can be known, and with how much certainty—that such talk poses for Dasein.</li><li>Curiosity is discussed in Section 36 as an outgrowth of care. At first, it might seem that curiosity is the opposite of care: it is difficult to indulge curiosity when one is acutely heedful of something specific, such as making it to work on time or not being eaten by a tiger. Yet Heidegger argues that Dasein involves a &ldquo;tendency to just-perceive&rdquo; that emerges from its constant search of its environment (circumspection) and its constant effort to bring that environment mentally closer (de-distancing).</li><li>In a sense, curiosity is what happens when Dasein runs out of obviously relevant material. Like a chef who is tasked with making a batch of croissants and then has to find a use for the leftover dough, Dasein disposes of its &ldquo;leftover&rdquo; perceptive faculties in the form of curiosity.</li><li>In Section 37 Heidegger states that ambiguity is the result of Dasein&rsquo;s reliance on &ldquo;the they&rdquo; for information and of the mismatch between Dasein&rsquo;s projects and the general social milieu. It arises from idle talk (where ambiguous reports emerge) and fuels curiosity (&ldquo;which report, if any, is true?&rdquo;).</li><li>Heidegger argues in Section 38 that idle talk, curiosity, and ambiguity together characterize Dasein in its everydayness. They shed light on an aspect of everyday Dasein which Heidegger calls &ldquo;entanglement&rdquo; (<em>Verfallen</em> in German) or &ldquo;falling prey.&rdquo; In succumbing to curiosity, in building its worldview from idle talk, and in failing to question ambiguity, Dasein &ldquo;falls away&rdquo; from itself and &ldquo;falls prey&rdquo; to (or becomes &ldquo;entangled in&rdquo;) the world.</li></ul><hr><a href=#division-1-chapter-6--care-as-the-being-of-dasein--summary><h1 id=division-1-chapter-6--care-as-the-being-of-dasein--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Division 1, Chapter 6 : Care as the Being of Dasein | Summary</h1></a><p>Share</p><a href=#key-takeaways-8><h2 id=key-takeaways-8><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Key Takeaways</h2></a><ul><li>In previous chapters, Heidegger analyzed being-in-the-world from specific points of view, possibly giving the impression that being-in-the-world can be broken into truly distinct parts. In Section 39, however, Heidegger asserts that being-in-the-world &ldquo;is primordially and constantly <em>whole</em>.&rdquo;</li><li>This &ldquo;totality,&rdquo; however, cannot be reached merely by &ldquo;cobbling together elements.&rdquo; Rather, a starting point must be chosen from which to analyze Dasein as a single coherent entity. To this end, Heidegger proposes that Dasein be viewed as care. In other words, care is not a property Dasein possesses—it <em>is</em> Dasein.</li><li>The care that Heidegger has in mind here is not &ldquo;caring&rdquo; or &ldquo;care for others&rdquo;; it is more akin to the &ldquo;care&rdquo; in &ldquo;careful&rdquo; or &ldquo;taking care.&rdquo; It is a kind of vigilance and solicitude about oneself, one&rsquo;s well-being, and one&rsquo;s continued existence. Heidegger&rsquo;s contention is that to be human is, essentially and by definition, to be subject to this kind of care.</li><li>From this point of view, Heidegger argues in Section 40 that one can make sense of the emotional &ldquo;attunements&rdquo; of Dasein, including first and foremost &ldquo;anxiety.&rdquo; In anxiety, Dasein undertakes a &ldquo;flight from itself&rdquo; in response to the &ldquo;crowding in&rdquo; of the world&rsquo;s possibilities. Anxiety, in Heidegger&rsquo;s view, is always anxiety <em>about</em> and anxiety <em>for</em> being-in-the-world. &ldquo;Dasein,&rdquo; he further proposes, &ldquo;is anxious in the very ground of its being,&rdquo; which is why anxiety can seem to arise physiologically and not merely mentally.</li><li>In Section 41 Heidegger attempts to fit anxiety and what it &ldquo;discloses&rdquo; (i.e., what it reveals about the self and/or the world) into the structure of Dasein as a whole. He contends that Dasein is &ldquo;a being which is concerned in its being about that being&rdquo;; that is, every individual is concerned about their continued existence.</li><li>Because of this care or concern, Dasein has a tendency to get &ldquo;ahead of itself.&rdquo; This &ldquo;being-ahead-of-itself&rdquo; can be thought of as an orientation that manifests itself not only in anxiety per se, but also in wishing, willing, and the mere &ldquo;urge to live.&rdquo;</li><li>To bring his claims about Dasein-as-care into focus, in Section 42 Heidegger quotes, translates, and analyzes an ancient fable in which Care (personified) shapes the first human out of clay and is allowed to &ldquo;possess it as long as it lives.&rdquo; The idea of a personified Care has its limits for Heidegger, who argues that care does not just dominate human existence—fundamentally, it <em>is</em> human existence.</li><li>In Section 43 Heidegger relates Dasein back to the various other &ldquo;modes of being.&rdquo; He argues that Dasein &ldquo;is objectively present as real,&rdquo; just as other beings are. That is, even though Dasein is a different type of being from the &ldquo;mere objective presence&rdquo; of a rock, both humans and rocks are &ldquo;objectively present&rdquo;—real in a way that is independent of subjective observers.</li><li>Thus, he contends, the &ldquo;problem of reality&rdquo;—what reality is, what it means to be &ldquo;real&rdquo;—can be approached through Dasein. In short, human existence can be treated as an example of something that is real and used as a point of entry for discussing reality itself.</li><li>In three distinct subsections, Heidegger considers three elements of the problem. He first raises the question &ldquo;whether there is a world at all and whether its being can be demonstrated.&rdquo; Demanding or attempting a proof here, he says, is a futile exercise because Dasein is always already in the world.</li><li>Next, he defends the assertion that an analysis of reality is only possible from a starting point of Dasein, since &ldquo;&lsquo;consciousness of reality&rsquo; is itself a way of being-in-the-world.&rdquo; He repeats the argument that Descartes, with his &ldquo;<em>cogito sum</em>&rdquo; [&ldquo;I think, [therefore] I am&rdquo;] is presupposing the objective, &ldquo;worldless&rdquo; presence of the ego. For Heidegger, it is a mistake to assume that the self can exist, or even be fruitfully contemplated, apart from the world.</li><li>Finally, Heidegger distinguishes between two ways in which reality might seem to depend on Dasein. He argues that &ldquo;reality is referred back to &mldr; care&rdquo; and thus to Dasein in the sense that, without Dasein, nothing can be said either &ldquo;to be&rdquo; or &ldquo;not to be.&rdquo; This is not, however, the same as asserting that objectively present things are coeval (of equal age) with Dasein, or that they cease to exist if Dasein does.</li><li>To give a somewhat simplified analogy—not from Heidegger himself—Dasein is like a flashlight that serves as the only source of light in a dark room. Without the flashlight, it is impossible to say whether anything else is &ldquo;in&rdquo; the room. But this does not mean that the objects in the room cease to exist when the flashlight is not shining on them.</li><li>In Section 44 Heidegger closes Division 1 of his book by treating &ldquo;truth&rdquo; in the same manner as the previous section treated &ldquo;reality.&rdquo; He argues that truth can only be understood in terms of what is &ldquo;disclosed&rdquo; (i.e., revealed) to Dasein and that one can only meaningfully speak of truth in the context of Dasein: &ldquo;&lsquo;There is&rsquo; truth only insofar as Dasein is and as long as it is.&rdquo;</li><li>In terms of the flashlight analogy, Heidegger&rsquo;s contention about truth is akin to saying that all information about the objects in the room is affected by the properties of the flashlight (Dasein). The objects do not &ldquo;have&rdquo; an intrinsic color, for instance, but each appears to have a certain consistent color when viewed in the flashlight&rsquo;s beam. Since there is no other source of light available, &ldquo;there is&rdquo; color only insofar as the light is shining on the objects.</li></ul><hr><a href=#division-2-chapter-1--the-possible-being-a-whole-of-dasein-and-being-toward-death--summary><h1 id=division-2-chapter-1--the-possible-being-a-whole-of-dasein-and-being-toward-death--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Division 2, Chapter 1 : The Possible Being-a-Whole of Dasein and Being-toward-Death | Summary</h1></a><a href=#key-takeaways-9><h2 id=key-takeaways-9><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Key Takeaways</h2></a><ul><li>In Section 45 Heidegger sums up the basic results of the &ldquo;preparatory analysis&rdquo; undertaken throughout Division 1. He rehashes the conclusion—explored in detail in Division 1, Chapter 6—that the &ldquo;totality&rdquo; of Dasein is &ldquo;care.&rdquo;</li><li>Yet much work remains. Heidegger argues that the characterization of Dasein thus far is not &ldquo;primordial,&rdquo; or in other words, not sufficiently deep and fundamental. To produce a sufficiently primordial ontology of Dasein, he suggests, it will be necessary to come to grips with Dasein&rsquo;s &ldquo;possible authenticity and wholeness,&rdquo; not just its everyday, default state of inauthenticity.</li><li>Consequently, Division 2 will largely be concerned with building a bridge between Dasein in its &ldquo;everydayness&rdquo; and Dasein in the context of an everyday life—between claims about ordinary, average existence and claims about a full, self-actualized existence.</li><li>These characteristics, and the structure of Dasein as a whole, come into focus from the viewpoint of &ldquo;temporality&rdquo; (<em>Zeitlichkeit</em> in German). Thus, time and Dasein&rsquo;s relationship to time will be the focus of Division 2.</li><li>In Section 46 Heidegger begins the chapter proper by admitting that it <em>seems</em> impossible to grasp Dasein in its totality. Indeed, characterizing Dasein as care, with its implications of something missing or unfinished, seems to suggest that Dasein is not and can never be whole. Are these problems illusory, Heidegger now asks, or are they fundamental and unavoidable roadblocks to understanding Dasein and thus to understanding being in general?</li><li>Heidegger proposes in Section 47 to, in effect, sneak up on these questions by considering Dasein from the perspective of time: Dasein is temporal and, more specifically, mortal. He contends that although Dasein cannot experience its own death, it can see in the death of others how &ldquo;Dasein reaches its wholeness in death.&rdquo; Death is the transition from Dasein to &ldquo;no-longer-Dasein.&rdquo;</li><li>At the same time, there are limits to what Dasein can learn from the death of another: &ldquo;No one can take the other&rsquo;s dying away from him,&rdquo; Heidegger observes, and conversely no one can fully appreciate the experience of &ldquo;going-out-of-the-world&rdquo; by merely watching someone undergo it.</li><li>Still, says Heidegger in Section 48, death raises the possibility of characterizing Dasein in terms of &ldquo;end and wholeness.&rdquo; Dasein is in a constant state of &ldquo;not yet,&rdquo; he asserts, " a constant lack of wholeness which finds its end in death." The fact of a particular human&rsquo;s existence can also, somewhat somberly, be construed as the fact of not having ceased to exist yet.</li><li>In this sense, Heidegger suggests, Dasein—human &ldquo;being&rdquo;—is like an unripe fruit or a not-quite-full moon. But there are limits to such analogies. A fruit &ldquo;fulfills itself&rdquo; in ripening, but &ldquo;ending does not necessarily mean fulfilling oneself.&rdquo; It can just as easily mean a mere stopping, like the end of a road, or a &ldquo;finishedness&rdquo; like the last brushstroke of a painting.</li><li>&ldquo;None of these modes of ending,&rdquo; he announces, &ldquo;are able to characterize death appropriately as the &rsquo;end&rsquo; of Dasein.&rdquo; Death is not quite a ripening, not quite a fulfillment, not quite a finishing. What matters about death—about ending—for the purposes of ontology is that it affects the entirety of Dasein, not just the part lived last. Dasein involves &ldquo;being toward the end&rdquo; (<em>Sein zum Ende</em> in German), even when it is not &ldquo;at the end.&rdquo;</li><li>Before proceeding further, Heidegger pauses in Section 49 to clarify that he is interested in death <em>existentially</em> and not in, say, biological, psychological, or theological ways. Being toward the end (i.e., being-toward-death) means being in awareness of (and oriented by) the future point at which Dasein will cease to be. It does not have to do, at least not directly, with the ticking of the proverbial biological clock.</li><li>Likewise, Heidegger is careful to explain that his analysis is not concerned with, or affected by, concepts of immortality or an afterlife. Death is the end of Dasein <em>as</em> Dasein and derives its ontological significance from this fact. If some other state of being follows death, it is not the state that is being characterized in <em>Being and Time</em>.</li><li>How are the characteristics of Dasein revealed in death? Heidegger explains in Section 50 that although death is &ldquo;something not yet objectively present,&rdquo; it is present for Dasein as an &ldquo;imminence.&rdquo; &ldquo;Death,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;is a possibility of being that Dasein always has to take upon itself.&rdquo; This does not always—or even usually—mean confronting the fact of death. Often it means avoiding death or covering up one&rsquo;s awareness of death.</li><li>Section 51 says more about these latter, ordinary attitudes toward death. In everyday life, Heidegger declares, one encounters death not in the stark awareness of one&rsquo;s mortality, but &ldquo;as a familiar event occurring within the world.&rdquo; Others die, allowing one to indulge the &ldquo;opinion&rdquo; that death is something that happens to &ldquo;the they,&rdquo; not to oneself. It is easy, on an everyday basis, to be &ldquo;tranquilized&rdquo; about death, to &ldquo;cover over&rdquo; the inevitable.</li><li>Yet in spite of the constant &ldquo;flight from death,&rdquo; only in exceptional cases does Dasein rise to the level of a frank anxiety about death. Social life functions effectively to smooth over and attenuate these anxieties.</li><li>In one sense, the individual in day-to-day life is &ldquo;certain&rdquo; of death, intellectually assenting to such claims as, &ldquo;So far as one knows, all human beings &lsquo;die.&rsquo;&rdquo; Yet in a deeper sense, the self lacks conviction regarding its own death. It may appear to accept death with such qualifications as &ldquo;but not right away&rdquo; or &ldquo;sometime later.&rdquo; But this, Heidegger says in Section 52, is not a real acceptance because it misses what is so peculiar to death—&ldquo;that it is possible in every moment.&rdquo;</li><li>Heidegger closes the section with a question: can death be authentically understood as something &ldquo;ownmost&rdquo; (i.e., inalienable, unavoidably specific to the self), &ldquo;certain,&rdquo; and &ldquo;insuperable&rdquo;? Much of the remaining five chapters will be devoted to answering this question.</li><li>In Section 53 Heidegger reviews the characteristics of death as outlined above, cumulatively deriving them one from another. Death, he concludes, is an &ldquo;ownmost, nonrelational, insuperable, and certain possibility [that] is indefinite with regard to its certainty.&rdquo; It is in principle possible for a person to &ldquo;be-toward-death&rdquo; in a way that authentically embraces these characteristics, but Heidegger remains for the moment skeptical that such an authentic &ldquo;being-toward-death&rdquo; ever actually arises.</li></ul><hr><a href=#division-2-chapter-2--the-attestation-of-dasein-of-an-authentic-potentiality-of-being-and-resoluteness--summary><h1 id=division-2-chapter-2--the-attestation-of-dasein-of-an-authentic-potentiality-of-being-and-resoluteness--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Division 2, Chapter 2 : The Attestation of Dasein of an Authentic Potentiality-of-Being and Resoluteness | Summary</h1></a><a href=#key-takeaways-10><h2 id=key-takeaways-10><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Key Takeaways</h2></a><ul><li>How and where can the authentic being-toward-death (and thus the authentic potentiality-of-being) be attested? The problem seems formidable, since people are, for the most, part mired in everydayness, with their sense of self compromised by the social demands of &ldquo;the they.&rdquo;</li><li>Nevertheless, Heidegger suggests in Section 54 that such a potentiality is attested in a perhaps unexpected way: by the &ldquo;voice of conscience.&rdquo; Conscience, he suggests, is a form of self-disclosure, but it also &ldquo;summon[s] Dasein to its ownmost potentiality-of-being-a-self.&rdquo; In responding to the call of conscience, the self reveals a desire to <em>be</em> a self, to have a conscience in the first place; it &ldquo;chooses&rdquo; to be a self.</li><li>Beginning in Section 55 Heidegger fills in the sketched-out claims of Section 54. He explores the &ldquo;foundations&rdquo; of conscience and characterizes it, somewhat lyrically, as &ldquo;an abrupt jolt,&rdquo; a call &ldquo;from afar to afar [that] reaches one who wants to be brought back.&rdquo; Conscience closes the gap when one has distanced oneself from oneself.</li><li>But in what sense, Heidegger asks in Section 56, is conscience a call? In many ways, he concedes, conscience is an unusual kind of call: it goes from oneself to oneself, and indeed summons oneself to oneself. But the self who calls and the self who is called are not quite identical. The one being called is the &ldquo;they-self,&rdquo; lost in everydayness among the opinions and pressures of &ldquo;the they.&rdquo; The &ldquo;self&rdquo; responds, and the &ldquo;they&rdquo; falls away.</li><li>The call of conscience, Heidegger clarifies, is not comparable to more typical forms of discourse: nothing is &ldquo;talked about,&rdquo; no information is given, no story is told. Indeed, &ldquo;conscience speaks &mldr; in the mode of silence.&rdquo; Because there is no discursive content per se, the call of conscience is not prone to deception or misinterpretation as ordinary talk might be.</li><li>Another question arises in Section 57: if conscience is a call to the self, who does the calling? Heidegger&rsquo;s answer is, &ldquo;Dasein as care.&rdquo; He explains that the caller, the one being summoned, and the one called by the summons are all Dasein, but from different perspectives. As caller, Dasein is &ldquo;anxious &mldr; about its potentiality-of-being.&rdquo; By this same call, Dasein is summoned &ldquo;to its ownmost potentiality-of-being&rdquo; and out of entanglement with &ldquo;the they.&rdquo;</li><li>The arrangement is, to put it a bit reductively in terms not from Heidegger, like leaving one&rsquo;s bag in front of the door so it is not forgotten on the way to work the next day. The &ldquo;awake self&rdquo; tonight is leaving a message (&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget this&rdquo;) for the &ldquo;groggy self&rdquo; of the following morning. Conscience is a vigilant part of the self sending a message to another, less alert and highly distracted, part of the self.</li><li>The call of conscience derives its &ldquo;uncanniness&rdquo; from the fact that it is the call of an inner voice—that is, &ldquo;no one&rdquo; and &ldquo;nothing&rdquo; external can be identified as the origin of the call.</li><li>Where there is a conscience, it is customary to speak of guilt and innocence. Heidegger takes issue in Section 58 with the &ldquo;vulgar&rdquo; (i.e., ordinary) definition of a guilty conscience, but uses this definition as a steppingstone to something more appropriate for his purposes. He eventually identifies guilt as arising from Dasein&rsquo;s thrownness—from its inability to &ldquo;get behind&rdquo; the circumstance of being thrown in the world and take charge &ldquo;from the ground up.&rdquo;</li><li>The call of conscience does not &ldquo;make&rdquo; a person guilty in the above sense, but discloses or reveals the guilt. In calling, one summons oneself to the &ldquo;ownmost possibility of existence&rdquo;—to live the life that is uniquely one&rsquo;s own. In listening, the self &ldquo;chooses itself.&rdquo;</li><li>Nearing the end of the chapter, in Section 59 Heidegger draws a further distinction between the &ldquo;existential&rdquo; and &ldquo;vulgar&rdquo; ideas of conscience. He underscores the point that commonsense notions of &ldquo;good&rdquo; and &ldquo;bad&rdquo; do not authentically capture—and indeed unnecessarily narrow—the role of conscience and the experience of guilt. This is not to say that a moral calculus of good and evil is useless or foolish, merely that it does not represent the full spectrum of what a conscience is and does.</li><li>In Section 60 Heidegger circles back to address the &ldquo;potentiality-of-being&rdquo; referred to in previous sections. He argues that this potentiality is attested to by conscience and evident in &ldquo;wanting-to-have-a-conscience.&rdquo; Conscience provokes anxiety, which leads to reticence, but from this reticence can emerge a resoluteness to hear what conscience has to say in spite of anxiety.</li><li>This resoluteness, in turn, constitutes an embrace of one&rsquo;s &ldquo;potentiality-of-being.&rdquo; By being resolute, attending to the call of conscience and following its implications, one &ldquo;situates&rdquo; oneself and gains access to a vantage point from which to appreciate one&rsquo;s &ldquo;opportunities&rdquo; and potential. Resoluteness pulls one out of the vague and passive view of &ldquo;the they&rdquo; and into a more active and authentic way of being.</li></ul><hr><a href=#division-2-chapter-3--the-authentic-potentiality-for-being-a-whole-of-dasein-and-temporality-as-the-ontological-meaning-of-care--summary><h1 id=division-2-chapter-3--the-authentic-potentiality-for-being-a-whole-of-dasein-and-temporality-as-the-ontological-meaning-of-care--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Division 2, Chapter 3 : The Authentic Potentiality-for-Being-a-Whole of Dasein, and Temporality as the Ontological Meaning of Care | Summary</h1></a><a href=#key-takeaways-11><h2 id=key-takeaways-11><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Key Takeaways</h2></a><ul><li>But how does resoluteness, or anything said in the previous chapter, connect back to temporality? The key, Heidegger says in Section 61, is &ldquo;anticipation.&rdquo; In resoluteness, the self contemplates possibilities that are nearer or farther away. The ultimate &ldquo;horizon&rdquo; of such possibilities is death.</li><li>Thus, it is not just resoluteness, but &ldquo;anticipatory&rdquo; resoluteness, that forms the authentic &ldquo;potentiality-for-being-a-whole&rdquo; of Dasein. That is, being resolute in the anticipation of death allows one to move toward wholeness, or even to recognize the possibility of such a move. Such resoluteness, which in Section 62 Heidegger ties back to earlier ideas of guilt and conscience, is not a &ldquo;way out&rdquo; or a means of &ldquo;overcoming&rdquo; death. It is a &ldquo;sober&rdquo; confrontation with death, a casting aside of disguises and other &ldquo;entertaining incidentals&rsquo;&rdquo; or distractions. Yet this sobriety leads to &ldquo;unshakable joy&rdquo; in the possibilities of life.</li><li>In Section 63 Heidegger claims he has demonstrated to his satisfaction that anticipatory resoluteness is a kind of authentic &ldquo;potentiality-for-being-a-whole,&rdquo; and that such a way is therefore possible. The next question is, &ldquo;Is this the only way, or are there others?&rdquo;</li><li>He answers that anticipatory resoluteness is ultimately indispensable and cannot be replaced with another criterion. Without such resoluteness, one falls into the &ldquo;short-sighted&rdquo; error of &ldquo;mak[ing] &rsquo;life&rsquo; a problem <em>and then occasionally</em> tak[ing] death into account too.&rdquo;</li><li>Along the way, Heidegger returns to a criticism raised and considered much earlier in the book: that the mode of self-understanding described here is &ldquo;circular.&rdquo; Without denying that &ldquo;circular logic&rdquo; may be inappropriate in some settings, he argues that here the charge of circularity misses the point. Dasein <em>is</em> circular because care is circular: it is the care of a self for and about that self.</li><li>In Section 64 comes a discussion of the connection between care and selfhood. The core question here: &ldquo;How can Dasein exist as a unity&rdquo; in light of the extremely varied discussion to which it has given rise in the book? Heidegger argues that the unity of Dasein is evident in the &ldquo;bare consciousness&rdquo; usually described as the &ldquo;I&rdquo; or the &ldquo;self.&rdquo; &ldquo;In saying-I,&rdquo; he urges, &ldquo;Dasein expresses itself as being-in-the-world.&rdquo; In other words, Heidegger argues that selfhood is included in the very &ldquo;structure of care&rdquo;—that a self to take care <em>of</em> is a basic part of the recipe.</li><li>From there, Heidegger argues in Section 65 that temporality is the ontological meaning of care, a claim he bases on a close analysis of the idea of &ldquo;anticipatory resoluteness.&rdquo; His reasoning, in brief, is that care entails an orientation toward the future and, inevitably, toward the end of that future for the individual. From this, a claim follows along lines similar to the transitive property of equality in algebra: if Dasein is care, and the meaning of care is temporality, then &ldquo;the meaning of Dasein is temporality.&rdquo;</li><li>Heidegger contends that being-toward-death—embracing temporality, living in full consciousness of death—can enable an &ldquo;ecstatic&rdquo; departure from oneself. Finally, he observes that there is a &ldquo;vulgar&rdquo; tendency to view time as endless, but for the individual self, time is &ldquo;primordially&rdquo; finite, always guaranteed to come to an end sooner or later.</li><li>Heidegger says in Section 66 that it is possible to go deeper into the ontological exploration of Dasein. The final three chapters of the book will be devoted to this very purpose.</li></ul><hr><a href=#division-2-chapter-4--temporality-and-everydayness--summary><h1 id=division-2-chapter-4--temporality-and-everydayness--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Division 2, Chapter 4 : Temporality and Everydayness | Summary</h1></a><a href=#key-takeaways-12><h2 id=key-takeaways-12><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Key Takeaways</h2></a><ul><li>In the past two chapters, Heidegger focused on a possibility that was decidedly <em>not</em> &ldquo;everyday&rdquo;—the anticipatory resoluteness wherein the self lives authentically in awareness of death.

This may be because Heidegger originally envisioned his work as spanning two parts in six divisions, instead of the published two divisions. What is today read as <em>Being and Time</em> was conceived as roughly one-third of a much longer treatise.</li><li>Heidegger asserts in Section 78 that the foregoing discussion is still incomplete because temporality has not been fully incorporated into the discussion of Dasein. It remains to show how &ldquo;Dasein <em>as</em> temporality&rdquo; ends up &ldquo;tak[ing] account&rdquo; of time. To do so, and to shed further light on Dasein in its everydayness, Heidegger proposes to take a look at the &ldquo;vulgar concept of time,&rdquo; as opposed to the &ldquo;primordial time&rdquo; he has been conceptualizing up to this point.</li><li>Dasein, Heidegger reiterates in Section 79, is &ldquo;essentially ahead of itself.&rdquo; It is &ldquo;thrown into&rdquo; the world and &ldquo;falls prey&rdquo; to its allurements and distractions. In falling prey, Dasein enters a perspective of nows and thens, befores and afters, dates and times. All such apparatus, he argues, is built on top of the primordial, ecstatic temporality that brings past, present, and future together. Time, for the human being, is a unity that gets artificially divided, not a set of distinct instants that get artificially grouped together.</li><li>Heidegger states in Section 80 that in &ldquo;taking care of time,&rdquo; Dasein becomes involved in a &ldquo;time-reckoning&rdquo; exemplified by clocks and calendars. It comes to recognize a concept of &ldquo;public time,&rdquo; but much like space, this &ldquo;time&rdquo; is something in which innerworldly beings are encountered—not a kind of time that Dasein natively inhabits, so to speak.</li><li>In fact, innerworldly beings can also be called &ldquo;within-time&rdquo; to distinguish this &ldquo;objective,&rdquo; clock-based kind of temporality from the temporality experienced by Dasein.</li><li>The creation of this public time, of a &ldquo;world time&rdquo; by which objectively present things and objective events can be measured, appears to be very primitive in origin. Its primitiveness goes some way toward explaining the generality of the &ldquo;vulgar&rdquo; concept of time as the thing measured by a stopwatch. However, world time is not &ldquo;primordial&rdquo; like the temporality possessed by Dasein.</li><li>From world time and the need to attend to it comes the vulgar impression that time consists of an infinite, uninterrupted, and irreversible &ldquo;succession of nows.&rdquo; This concept, Heidegger observes in Section 81, is very persuasive, having even been adopted by such philosophers as Plato. It is, however, ultimately a &ldquo;leveling down&rdquo;—a taming, a dumbing-down, a diminishment—of the ecstatic but finite unity as which time is primordially experienced by humans.</li><li>In Section 82 Heidegger contrasts his foregoing conclusions about temporality with the writings of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, one of the most influential German philosophers since Kant. He challenges Hegel&rsquo;s idea that spirit &ldquo;falls into time,&rdquo; which makes time seem like something external to the self.</li><li>For Heidegger, temporality is the meaning of Dasein, and time is more central to Dasein&rsquo;s nature than Hegel&rsquo;s image would imply. Dasein is indeed &ldquo;thrown into&rdquo; the world, but its connection to the world is more intimate than that of an object thrown (or &ldquo;fallen&rdquo;) into an external medium. To the extent that the self is &ldquo;thrown into&rdquo; (or, in Hegel&rsquo;s phrase, &ldquo;falls into&rdquo;) time, for Heidegger, it is more like a sponge being &ldquo;thrown into&rdquo; a bucket of water than a boat being &ldquo;thrown into&rdquo; the sea.</li><li>The extremely brief Section 83 serves as a kind of resting point before the (as it happened, never published) third division of the work. Here, Heidegger takes stock of basic characteristics of Dasein and reminds the reader that the goal, going forward, will be &ldquo;to work out the question of being in general.&rdquo;</li></ul><hr><a href=#quotes><h1 id=quotes><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Quotes</h1></a><ol><li></li></ol><blockquote><p> Being is always the being of a being. </p></blockquote><p>Narrator,

For the classical and early modern philosophers whose systems Heidegger rejects, a major aim of ontology was to attain a concept of being that was as general as possible—applicable to people, to things, and even to God. Heidegger&rsquo;s declaration here is that &ldquo;being&rdquo; does not work this way. Fundamentally, being occurs in specific instances that may not be comparable to one another.

At this point in <em>Being and Time</em>, he has established his belief that Dasein and the world are inextricable, that Dasein cannot be thought of as either a passive observer or an active spectator separate from the world. A consequence here—important for understanding Dasein &ldquo;in its everydayness&rdquo;—is that Dasein&rsquo;s self-understanding comes through the world and, most of the time, &ldquo;in terms of it.&rdquo; One might approximate the situation by describing the world as the mirror in which Dasein sees itself, but even this implies a greater degree of separateness than Heidegger envisions.</p><ol start=6><li></li></ol><blockquote><p> Dasein is always what it can be and how it is its possibility. </p></blockquote><p>Narrator,

He is insistent that these are not <em>properties</em> Dasein <em>has</em>, so much as <em>ways</em> Dasein <em>is</em>. One such attribute is understanding—in particular, an understanding of possibilities. Much of what Heidegger calls &ldquo;authenticity&rdquo; relates to the way in which these possibilities are acknowledged, reckoned with, and embraced.</p><ol start=7><li></li></ol><blockquote><p> That about which one has anxiety is being-in-the-world as such. </p></blockquote><p>Narrator,

In attributing to anxiety this diffuse and totalizing quality, Heidegger anticipates the forms of <em>Angst</em> that will be examined by later existentialist thinkers.</p><ol start=8><li></li></ol><blockquote><p> Death is the ownmost, nonrelational, certain, and, as such, indefinite and insuperable possibility of Dasein. </p></blockquote><p>Narrator,

In effect, the definition reads as a list of the attributes of death most likely to be denied or &ldquo;covered over&rdquo; by Dasein in its inauthentic, everyday mode.</p><ol start=9><li></li></ol><blockquote><p> Dasein has been thrown into existence.

With it, Heidegger suggests something of what might have followed in this division—for instance, an attempt to take the preceding chapters&rsquo; ideas about Dasein and temporality and generalize them to more universal concepts of being and time.</p><hr><a href=#glossary><h1 id=glossary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Glossary</h1></a><p><strong>attunement:</strong> <em>(n)</em> the state of being in a mood.

His father was sexton of the local Roman Catholic parish. A sexton is responsible for maintaining church grounds and buildings, digging graves, and other minor duties. As a reflective and gifted child growing up in a religious community, Heidegger experienced a period of soul-searching in young adulthood. After completing high school in nearby Konstanz, he briefly considered becoming a Jesuit, a member of the Society of Jesus, a Roman Catholic order of religious men, and he spent two weeks with the order in 1909. He then went to the University of Freiburg to study theology, switching to philosophy partway through. He earned his doctorate in 1913 and received his habilitation—a European postdoctoral credential for university teaching—in 1915. From that year until 1923, Heidegger taught at his alma mater, serving as assistant to the famed German philosopher Edmund Husserl (1859–1938). He then spent five years teaching at the University of Marburg, where his lectures, famous for their brilliance, covered a sweeping range of philosophical topics. It was during this latter period that <em>Being and Time</em> definitively took shape.</p><p>When it appeared in 1927 <em>Being and Time</em> took the world of European philosophy by storm. The work secured Heidegger a full professorship at the University of Marburg and paved the way for his rehiring at Freiburg as the successor of German philosopher Edmund Husserl. As a major philosopher of the 20th century, Husserl left a distinctive stamp on Heidegger&rsquo;s thought and is the dedicatee of <em>Being and Time</em>. His writings on phenomenology—the philosophical study of subjective experiences—are a major jumping-off point for Heidegger&rsquo;s investigation of being. The eventual divergence of the two philosophers has as much to do with emphasis as with core beliefs: Husserl was interested in the problem of how phenomena, things that exist, relate to reality, whereas Heidegger boldly declared that &ldquo;phenomenology is ontology&rdquo;—meaning that he saw a study of phenomena as a viable route to an understanding of being.</p><a href=#heidegger-under-nazism><h3 id=heidegger-under-nazism><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Heidegger under Nazism</h3></a><p>In 1933 Nazi Party leader Adolf Hitler&rsquo;s (1889–1945) long rise to power culminated in his appointment as Chancellor of Germany and the passage of the Enabling Act, which granted Hitler virtually unlimited power on a &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; basis. Civil and political freedoms in Germany were curtailed and universities were forced to fall into line with Hitler&rsquo;s political views. It is in this climate that Heidegger was appointed rector of the University of Freiburg, a position that necessarily made him complicit in carrying out the Nazis&rsquo; agenda for higher education. Though he spent just a single year (1933–34) as rector before resigning, Heidegger remained an official member of the Nazi Party. He was therefore among those subjected to punitive &ldquo;de-Nazification&rdquo; measures—in his case, a period of suspension from teaching—after World War II (1939–45). The nature and moral implications of Heidegger&rsquo;s association with the Nazi Party have been a source of perennial interest to biographers, who remain divided in their interpretation of this episode from his life.</p><a href=#later-life-and-works><h3 id=later-life-and-works><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Later Life and Works</h3></a><p>Heidegger did not stop writing after <em>Being and Time</em>, though no single later work of his has proved quite as influential. One consequence of de-Nazification was that Heidegger was barred from teaching for several years after the war. He returned to the classroom at Freiburg in 1950 and published several collections of essays and lectures in such volumes as <em>What Is Called Thinking?</em> (1954) and <em>An Introduction to Metaphysics</em> (1953). Yet although he later described his affiliation with Nazism as &ldquo;the biggest stupidity of my life,&rdquo; he remained haunted by accusations of having collaborated with the Nazi regime. The publication of his private journals, the so-called Black Notebooks, in 2014 has done much to rekindle the controversy. Penned between 1931 and 1941, the first three published volumes contain undeniably anti-Semitic remarks, forcing Heidegger scholars to confront anew this aspect of his worldview.</p><p>Even so, by the time of his death on May 26, 1976, Heidegger was widely hailed as a major figure in 20th-century European philosophy. His <em>New York Times</em> obituary aptly describes him as a &ldquo;profoundly original&rdquo; thinker who had an &ldquo;enormous effect on fields ranging from physics to literary criticism.&rdquo; More broadly, Heidegger was among the figures who established many philosophical tendencies now taken for granted, such as the value of qualitative—not just quantitative—investigations. <em>Being and Time</em> is reflective of a larger paradigm shift in which the self and subjectivity play a greater role in philosophical inquiry.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://potatomat0.github.io/obsidian-public-vault/js/graph.6579af7b10c818dbd2ca038702db0224.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Nhat Hoang © 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://potatomat0.github.io/obsidian-public-vault/>Home</a></li><li><a href=http://nhatkothieunang.web.app/>Other hobby links</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/potatomat0/obsidian-public-vault>GitHub</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
