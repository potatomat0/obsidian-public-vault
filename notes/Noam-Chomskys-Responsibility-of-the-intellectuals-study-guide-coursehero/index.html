He shares his thoughts about important political events and discusses the role that intellectuals play in responding to the news. Chomsky closely investigates the mass media&rsquo;s coverage of the Vietnam War (1954–75) and offers a critical analysis of the coverage. He contends that the reasons cited for the United States&rsquo; involvement in Asia reveal questionable motives. Chomsky encourages other intellectuals to follow him in sharing their critical insights as a means of uncovering and disseminating the facts. Chomsky&rsquo;s critique of the mass media continues to be relevant as allegations about the manipulation of news and information populate public discourse.</p><a href=#perspective-and-narrator><h3 id=perspective-and-narrator><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Perspective and Narrator</h3></a><p>&ldquo;The Responsibility of Intellectuals&rdquo; is written from the first-person perspective. Noam Chomsky offers his thoughts about how intellectuals ought to respond to momentous political events.</p><a href=#about-the-title><h3 id=about-the-title><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>About the Title</h3></a><p>&ldquo;The Responsibility of Intellectuals&rdquo; identifies Chomsky&rsquo;s aim in the essay. The word &ldquo;responsibility&rdquo; in the title reveals the ethical dimensions of the role that scholars play in politics.</p><hr><a href=#main-ideas><h1 id=main-ideas><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span> Main Ideas</h1></a><a href=#lack-of-concern-for-truth><h2 id=lack-of-concern-for-truth><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Lack of Concern for Truth</h2></a><p>Noam Chomsky writes that &ldquo;it is the responsibility of intellectuals to speak the truth and to expose lies.&rdquo; He contends that this may seem obvious but that an indifference to truth is actually spreading among intellectuals. Chomsky quotes the German philosopher Martin Heidegger (1889–1976) who defined truth as &ldquo;the revelation of that which makes a people certain, clear, and strong.&rdquo; Chomsky suggests that Heidegger&rsquo;s conception of truth entails the justification of lying on consequentialist grounds. Consequentialism is a moral system that defines right action in terms of the overall good the action produces. Lies that promote the good of the majority can thus be seen as acceptable when actions are judged solely by their outcomes. Chomsky worries that redefining truth in the manner that Heidegger recommends divorces truth from the facts. He notes that &ldquo;the facts are known to all who care to know.&rdquo; Chomsky defends a more rigorous scientific understanding of truth.</p><p>Chomsky asks what responsibility citizens bear for &ldquo;the incredible sequence of lies on the part of our government and its spokesmen.&rdquo; Chomsky refers specifically to America&rsquo;s involvement in the Vietnam War (1954–75). Chomsky argues that much of the popular press coverage of the war aims at distorting the truth about America&rsquo;s reasons for sending troops to Vietnam. He alleges that certain intellectuals help to disguise &ldquo;the unconstrained viciousness that the mass media present to us.&rdquo; Chomsky contends that &ldquo;a real or feigned naiveté&rdquo; among intellectuals produces misinformation regarding America&rsquo;s motives for engaging in the conflict in Vietnam. He cites American historian Arthur Schlesinger (1917–2017) as an example of an intellectual whose work depicts unjustifiable violence as &ldquo;perfectly rational.&rdquo; Chomsky expresses his fears about the American &ldquo;propaganda apparatus&rdquo; that increasingly employs intellectuals to paint America&rsquo;s atrocities in a positive light. This technique serves to stifle and suppress any criticism of the government&rsquo;s policies and decisions and thereby runs counter to the aims of democracy.</p><a href=#rational-and-irrational-forms-of-protest><h2 id=rational-and-irrational-forms-of-protest><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Rational and Irrational Forms of Protest</h2></a><p>Chomsky points to a trend in the media of distinguishing the &ldquo;responsible&rdquo; critics of the war from the &ldquo;hysterical&rdquo; ones. He notes that &ldquo;the &lsquo;hysterical&rsquo; critics are to be identified, apparently, by their irrational refusal.&rdquo; The critics portrayed as hysterical share a refusal to accept that &ldquo;the United States has the right to extend its power and control without limit.&rdquo; All other critics seem to simply accept the United States&rsquo; right to extend power as though it were the &ldquo;one fundamental political axiom.&rdquo; Chomsky explains that any critic who challenges this axiom is labeled &ldquo;sentimental&rdquo; or &ldquo;emotional,&rdquo; and their opposition to the war is deemed &ldquo;irrational.&rdquo; Those &ldquo;responsible&rdquo; critics who do not challenge the fundamental belief in the United States&rsquo; right to unlimited power are the only critics taken seriously. Chomsky casts doubt on the legitimacy of labeling as &ldquo;hysterical&rdquo; those who challenge the United States&rsquo;s right to extend power.</p><p>Chomsky examines the American writer Irving Kristol&rsquo;s (1920–2009) analysis of Vietnam protests that appeared in the magazine <em>Encounter</em> in 1965. Kristol distinguishes between &ldquo;responsible critics&rdquo; and the &ldquo;teach-in movement&rdquo; born on university campuses in 1965. Kristol accuses &ldquo;university protesters&rdquo; of claiming to know &ldquo;what the Vietnamese people really want&rdquo; and of simply delivering &ldquo;harangues on &rsquo;the power structure.&rsquo;&rdquo; Kristol presents the protests of &ldquo;psychologists, mathematicians, chemists, or philosophers&rdquo; as irrational. Chomsky asks whether it is fair for Kristol to simply assume &ldquo;the purity of American motives.&rdquo; Chomsky wonders why anyone should accept Kristol&rsquo;s claim that policy decisions should &ldquo;be left to &rsquo;experts&rsquo; with Washington contacts.&rdquo; Chomsky points out the absurdity in Kristol&rsquo;s suggestion that intellectuals without political expertise can&rsquo;t properly draw conclusions about American foreign policy decisions. He suggests that intellectuals such as Kristol demonize university protests and brand them &ldquo;irrational&rdquo; to stifle America&rsquo;s anti-war sentiments.</p><a href=#the-scholar-expert-and-the-free-floating-intellectual><h2 id=the-scholar-expert-and-the-free-floating-intellectual><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The &ldquo;Scholar-Expert&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Free-Floating Intellectual&rdquo;</h2></a><p>Chomsky alleges that &ldquo;the scholar-expert replaces the &lsquo;free-floating intellectual&rdquo; in American sociologist Daniel Bell&rsquo;s (1919–2011) <em>The End of Ideology</em> (1960). Chomsky writes that Bell&rsquo;s discussion of ideology &ldquo;is as important for what it leaves unsaid as for its actual content.&rdquo; Bell&rsquo;s central contention is that &ldquo;ideology is dead&rdquo; and that there is a &ldquo;general agreement that each issue must be settled on its own terms.&rdquo; Ideology is associated with what Chomsky calls the &ldquo;free-floating intellectual&rdquo; who creates ideas as a means of improving social and political conditions. Ideology depends on a system of related ideas that create a framework through which to analyze social and political conditions. Bell views &ldquo;free-floating intellectuals&rdquo; with suspicion because he deems their task irrelevant. He alleges that scholars with specific technical expertise &ldquo;in the conduct of public affairs&rsquo;&rsquo; have replaced intellectuals wishing to advance ideological causes.</p><p>Chomsky claims that Bell&rsquo;s discussion of ideology hinges on Bell&rsquo;s understanding of ideology as &ldquo;the conversion of ideas into social levers.&rdquo; Bell declares ideology dead because he can find no evidence that scholar-experts have a desire to use ideas &ldquo;for the radical transformation of society.&rdquo; He argues that significant modifications in &ldquo;our way of life&rdquo; are unnecessary in &ldquo;the pluralistic society of the Welfare State.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Welfare State&rdquo; is a nation whose government concerns itself with caring for the needs of its citizens. Bell contends that the urge to resist the government or to change it in any fundamental way disappears in Welfare States. Chomsky challenges Bell&rsquo;s conclusion by noting that &ldquo;it seems fairly obvious that the classical problems are very much with us.&rdquo; Chomsky casts a shadow of doubt on Bell&rsquo;s claim that an &ldquo;intellectual consensus&rdquo; confirms the death of ideology.</p><hr><a href=#context><h1 id=context><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Context</h1></a><a href=#vietnam-war><h2 id=vietnam-war><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Vietnam War</h2></a><p>The Vietnam War (1954–75) involved a conflict between the communist government of North Vietnam and the government of South Vietnam. The South Vietnamese government opposed communism, which is a political and economic system in which the government owns or the entire community shares ownership of all land, machinery, and factories, and all wealth derived from them is expected to be shared equally amongst the people. The United States allied with the South Vietnamese government and sent troops to Vietnam to provide military support to fight the North beginning in 1965. The United States had an interest in preventing the expansion of the communist doctrines of the Soviet Union and China. U.S. involvement in Vietnam was thus considered a means to a larger political end of slowing the spread of communism across the globe.</p><p>Opposition to the war in Vietnam grew rapidly throughout the United States. Some of the most vocal opponents of the war were university students and faculty members whose protests gained widespread media coverage. The larger protests were quelled when the government enlisted the help of the National Guard to put an end to the protests. Four students were shot and killed by the Guard during a protest against the war at Kent State University in Ohio in 1970. The shooting caused the entire nation to reel in opposition to the United States&rsquo; involvement in Vietnam. Student protests turned into a nationwide strike aimed at forcing the United States government to end U.S. involvement in Vietnam. By the end of 1973, the United States had officially withdrawn from Vietnam and had terminated its military campaign in the region.</p><a href=#mccarthyism-and-the-red-scare><h2 id=mccarthyism-and-the-red-scare><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>McCarthyism and the Red Scare</h2></a><p>The threat of Communist infiltration of America&rsquo;s governmental affairs loomed large in the 1950s. U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy (1908–57) alleged government interference by communists seeking to abolish America&rsquo;s liberties. McCarthy held a series of investigations from 1952–54 aimed at finding U.S. government officials with secret communist inclinations. The fear of communism grew in America during these years in part because of the communist takeover in China. The activities of communists in the Soviet Union also threatened the security that Americans enjoyed in accumulating personal wealth and property. Many Americans feared that a communist takeover would result in the reallocation of wealth and property in the United States. The reallocation of wealth was at odds with the widespread belief in a meritocracy in which hard work earns money as its reward.</p><p>War broke out in Korea in 1950 when the communist-backed North Koreans invaded the Republic of Korea in the South. The United States sent military support to help the South Koreans ward off the communist threat. By 1951, the North had retreated, but the United States maintained its military presence in the region in the hope of achieving a unification of Korea. Conflicts with communist forces spread to Taiwan and French Indochina. America responded by bolstering its military presence in the region and quadrupling its defense spending. Fears of communism reached epic proportions in America during this &ldquo;Red Scare&rdquo; and pitted Americans against communists waving their red flags.</p><a href=#marxism><h2 id=marxism><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Marxism</h2></a><p>German philosopher Karl Marx (1818–83) outlined his political ideas in <em>The Communist Manifesto</em> (1848). Marx&rsquo;s theories combined his views about historical progress with his ideas regarding the division of wealth within society. His central contention was that eventually the working people would grow tired of laboring excessively and receiving little compensation in exchange. Marx predicted that working people would eventually rise up against business owners and demand an equal share of wealth. Marx believed that a widespread revolution would upset the power structure and lead to a future world free of exploitation and oppression.</p><p>Marx&rsquo;s writings grew in popularity in the early 20th century in Russia. Revolutionary leaders saw in Marx&rsquo;s philosophy a vision for the elimination of all inequalities. They advocated for improving the living conditions of the working poor by redistributing material wealth. Marxists desired the elimination of the differences that produced divisions within their communities. They increasingly attempted to turn Marx&rsquo;s political and economic ideas into systems of government. The Russian Revolution of 1917 led to the revolutionary seizure of property held by private citizens to force a just redistribution. Eventually Russian leaders such as the Russian dictator Joseph Stalin (1878–1953) worked to expand their revolutionary vision by instituting Marxist regimes in other nations. Stalin&rsquo;s expansionist policies prompted western democratic countries such as the United States to react with force to oppose the spread of Marxist ideas.</p><hr><a href=#key-figures><h1 id=key-figures><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Key Figures</h1></a><table><thead><tr><th>Key Figure</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Noam Chomsky</td><td>Noam Chomsky (b. 1928) is the author of &ldquo;The Responsibility of Intellectuals.&rdquo;

<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Responsibility-of-Intellectuals/author/ rel=noopener>Chomsky</a> first read Macdonald&rsquo;s articles in the magazine <em>Politics</em> (1945–46) in the aftermath of the widespread death and destruction of World War II (1939–45). Chomsky explains that Macdonald&rsquo;s articles &ldquo;have lost none of their power or persuasiveness.&rdquo; Macdonald&rsquo;s concerns about &ldquo;war guilt&rdquo; and people&rsquo;s responsibilities with respect to the decisions of their governments remain important and relevant today.</p><p>Chomsky contends that &ldquo;intellectuals are in a position to expose the lies of governments&rdquo; and to analyze government decisions. He argues that intellectuals ought to provide critical analyses of policy decisions. Intellectuals enjoy more political liberty and better access to information than average citizens. Chomsky suggests that intellectuals consider &ldquo;to what extent the American people bear responsibility&rdquo; for the United States&rsquo; involvement in the Vietnam War (1954–75). Chomsky calls the American military response in Vietnam a &ldquo;savage American assault on a largely helpless rural population.&rdquo; He contends that most intellectuals simply &ldquo;stood by in silence and apathy&rdquo; while the government sanctioned the killing of civilians in Vietnam. Chomsky urges intellectuals to reconsider the privileged position that they hold and the responsibility to &ldquo;speak the truth&rdquo; that comes along with that position.</p><a href=#the-importance-of-context><h3 id=the-importance-of-context><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Importance of Context</h3></a><p>Chomsky argues that much of the popular press&rsquo;s coverage of the Vietnam War fails to communicate the historical context surrounding the war. Chomsky sees intellectuals as experts on understanding the historical circumstances that inform policy decisions made at the international level. He insinuates that important historical facts are intentionally omitted from media coverage of the war so as to influence the public&rsquo;s perception. The result is a &ldquo;real or feigned naiveté about American actions that reaches startling proportions.&rdquo; Chomsky contends that the apologists defending American aggression act as if policy makers have pure and selfless motives. They pretend to have no knowledge of the more malignant forces in political history. They instead speak of the Chinese &ldquo;menace&rdquo; that threatens American security. This idea helps to ingratiate the public to the policy decisions that aggressively advance America&rsquo;s interests in dominating other nations.</p><a href=#demonizing-anti-war-protests><h3 id=demonizing-anti-war-protests><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Demonizing Anti-War Protests</h3></a><p>Chomsky highlights the increasingly popular distinction between so-called &ldquo;responsible&rdquo; policy makers and the &ldquo;university protesters.&rdquo; This distinction appears in publications that cover the Vietnam War such as <em>The New York Times</em> and <em>Encounter</em> magazine. The reports portray policy makers offering minor critiques about the United States&rsquo;s strategy in Vietnam (1954–75) as rational and competent. Policy experts accuse university protesters of baselessly claiming to know &ldquo;what the Vietnamese people really want.&rdquo; They allege that the protestors&rsquo; assumptions about the Vietnamese are made on the basis of emotion and are thus unfounded. The university protesters are depicted as immature and reactionary, and their demand that the war end is deemed &ldquo;irrelevant.&rdquo; The policy makers&rsquo; perspectives are promoted as fully informed by political expertise and experience. The press thus touts the expert opinion as the only legitimate perspective and insinuates that the university protesters can&rsquo;t understand international affairs. Chomsky asks whether it seems reasonable to insist that the experts alone &ldquo;command the necessary knowledge&rdquo; to criticize policy decisions. He defends intellectuals as equally capable of interpreting complex information and of analyzing the various strategies that government leaders must consider.</p><a href=#analyzing-ideologies><h3 id=analyzing-ideologies><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analyzing Ideologies</h3></a><p>Chomsky writes that &ldquo;when we consider the responsibility of intellectuals, our basic concern must be their role in the creation and analysis of ideology.&rdquo; An ideology is a system of ideas that informs political theories and policies. Chomsky discusses the American sociologist Daniel Bell&rsquo;s (1919–2011) essay &ldquo;The End of Ideology&rdquo; (1960), which calls ideology &ldquo;a mask for class interest.&rdquo; Bell argues that intellectuals no longer see any need to employ ideology to achieve social change. He thus concludes that &ldquo;ideology is dead.&rdquo; Chomsky offers a critical assessment of Bell&rsquo;s conclusion and contends that it is proof that &ldquo;the classical problems are very much with us.&rdquo; He mentions &ldquo;the paradox of poverty&rdquo; in particular. He notes that poverty is confusing in that it continues to rise even though global wealth is growing exponentially. Chomsky calls Bell&rsquo;s attitude &ldquo;utopian&rdquo; because it frames the communists&rsquo; opposition to privatization as merely an obstacle to &ldquo;building democratic institutions.&rdquo; Chomsky contends that worries about the growth of &ldquo;democratic institutions&rdquo; reflect the unique anxieties of elite Americans. People in third-world or underdeveloped countries are forced to worry more about their survival than about the success of their institutions.</p><p>Chomsky warns that &ldquo;elite&rdquo; bureaucrats could undermine revolutionary movements that aim at establishing &ldquo;true democratic institutions&rdquo; across the globe. He concludes by cautioning against &ldquo;accepting society&rdquo; as it is. Chomsky encourages intellectuals to stay engaged in political discussions and to refuse to simply reinforce the harmful norms pedaled by government misinformation campaigns. Intellectuals have a responsibility to openly address the dehumanizing and demoralizing attitudes shaping policy decisions in Vietnam. Chomsky warns that failing to fulfill this responsibility amounts to a silent consent to government-sponsored atrocities.</p><a href=#analysis><h2 id=analysis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><a href=#the-intellectuals-position><h3 id=the-intellectuals-position><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Intellectual&rsquo;s Position</h3></a><p>Noam Chomsky describes his sense that American writer Dwight Macdonald&rsquo;s (1906–82) political articles in the magazine <em>Politics</em> (1945–46) maintain their &ldquo;power&rdquo; even twenty years later. Chomsky summarizes the specific evidence Macdonald introduces in investigating what responsibility citizens bear in the face of government-sponsored atrocities. Chomsky notes that Macdonald&rsquo;s investigation is important for &ldquo;anyone whose political and moral consciousness had been formed by the horrors of the 1930s.&rdquo; Chomsky alludes to his own struggle as a student to come to terms with some of the worst atrocities he was learning about.</p><p>Chomsky contends that intellectuals &ldquo;are in a position to expose the lies of governments, to analyze actions according to their causes.&rdquo; Chomsky&rsquo;s argument is founded on a distinction between the general public and the &ldquo;intellectual&rdquo; whose livelihood involves critical thinking. The intellectual is accustomed to research and to cultivating their own ideas about the world. The general public generally must rely on mass media for their news and information. Chomsky explains that intellectuals &ldquo;have the power that comes from political liberty, from access to information and freedom of expression.&rdquo; Chomsky defines power in political terms and argues that intellectuals have more power than ordinary citizens. This power differential results in a difference in responsibilities for intellectuals. Ordinary people are not in a position to critically evaluate government policies, but intellectuals are. Chomsky clarifies that the privilege of holding a position as an intellectual comes with a unique set of responsibilities. He aims to articulate those responsibilities by applying his ideas to an analysis of the United States government&rsquo;s actions.</p><a href=#lies-and-misinformation><h3 id=lies-and-misinformation><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Lies and Misinformation</h3></a><p>Chomsky writes that &ldquo;it is the responsibility of intellectuals to speak the truth and to expose lies.&rdquo; He launches an investigation of what he sees as a government misinformation campaign. Chomsky describes how the American historian Arthur Schlesinger (1917–2017) admitted to lying to <em>The New York Times</em> reporters in 1965. Schlesinger had lied about the American Central Intelligence Agency&rsquo;s plan to attack Cuba to fight communism during the Bay of Pigs invasion (1961). Chomsky points out that Schlesinger&rsquo;s published account of his knowledge of the United States government&rsquo;s strategy in Cuba contradicted his statement to the press. Schlesinger later explained that his lie was in &ldquo;the national interest.&rdquo; Chomsky expresses his surprise about the lack of reaction Shlesinger&rsquo;s confession of lying garnered. Chomsky contends that &ldquo;it is significant that such events provoke so little response in the intellectual community.&rdquo;</p><p>Chomsky addresses &ldquo;the power of the government&rsquo;s propaganda apparatus&rdquo; to stifle important information about questionable governmental affairs and policies. Chomsky was writing in 1967 during the Vietnam War (1954–75) in which the United States was fighting the communist regime in North Vietnam. Chomsky alleges that &ldquo;the deceit and distortion surrounding the American invasion of Vietnam is by now so familiar that it has lost its power to shock.&rdquo; Chomsky claims that Schlesinger&rsquo;s comments to <em>The New York Times</em> in 1966 depicted the bombing of North Vietnam in 1965 as &ldquo;perfectly rational.&rdquo; Chomsky notes that Schlesinger&rsquo;s assessment of the bombing demonstrates his contempt for the silent audience that will simply accept his perspective as authoritative. Chomsky thus reveals that he disagrees with Schlesigner&rsquo;s analysis. He views the bombing of North Vietnam as an unjustifiable act of aggression. He challenges intellectuals to correct lies and misinformation campaigns that he thinks leverage support for the unjustified use of force.</p><p>Chomsky argues that there is a &ldquo;real or feigned naiveté about American actions.&rdquo; He thus insinuates that the unwillingness of media reports to question American motives is intentionally disguised as ignorance. Chomsky points to Schlesinger&rsquo;s claim that American involvement in Vietnam is &ldquo;part of our general program of international goodwill.&rdquo; Chomsky expresses his outrage by asking whether this remark reveals &ldquo;a colossal cynicism&rdquo; or just an inability &ldquo;to comprehend elementary phenomena of contemporary history.&rdquo; Chomsky suggests that the former rather than the latter is the case. He writes that &ldquo;it surpasses belief&rdquo; that anyone could endorse such blatantly inappropriate statements. Chomsky makes it clear that he sees Schlesinger&rsquo;s comments as propaganda that intentionally distorts the truth about America&rsquo;s aggression in Asia.</p><a href=#missing-evidence><h3 id=missing-evidence><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Missing Evidence</h3></a><p>Chomsky quotes the American economist Walt Rostow&rsquo;s (1916–2003) book <em>An American Policy in Asia</em> (1955). Rostow writes that Americans &ldquo;are openly threatened and we feel menaced by Communist China.&rdquo; Chomsky sarcastically comments that &ldquo;to prove that we are menaced is of course unnecessary.&rdquo; He contends that the fact that we &ldquo;feel&rdquo; menaced has become the basis for justifying the aggressive American military campaign in Vietnam. He makes it clear that he finds rational justification for the war and evidence of an actual threat to be lacking. Rostow does little more than allege that America needs to &ldquo;counter an &lsquo;ideological threat.&rsquo;&rdquo; Chomsky casts doubt on the reality of this threat. He instead suggests that Asians pose no threat and offers an alternative hypothesis. He describes Asians as concerned with &ldquo;preserving the &lsquo;dignity of the individual&rsquo; against concentrations of foreign or domestic capital.&rdquo; Chomsky alleges that Vietnam&rsquo;s resistance to American control is what has prompted America to invade Vietnam. Chomsky calls Rostow&rsquo;s discussion of a Chinese threat little more than another contribution to &ldquo;this sorry picture.&rdquo; He singles Rostow out as a propagandizing government ally who has failed to fulfill the duties associated with his role as a public intellectual.</p><p>Chomsky examines additional sources of what he considers to be propaganda aimed at increasing public support for war. Chomsky writes about the &ldquo;pseudo-scientific posing&rdquo; of the American intellectual and strategist Herman Kahn (1922–83). Kahn&rsquo;s book <em>On Thermonuclear War</em> (1960) compares traditional warfare with nuclear war. Chomsky makes it clear that he finds Kahn&rsquo;s book lacking in substance. He calls it &ldquo;one of the emptiest works of our time.&rdquo; Chomsky alleges that Kahn &ldquo;proposes no theories, no explanations, no factual assumptions that can be tested.&rdquo; Chomsky insinuates that any positive reception for Kahn&rsquo;s book is the result of its attempt at justifying aggressive military campaigns. Kahn&rsquo;s position as a social scientist gives Chomsky a reason to wonder whether or not social science deserves to be called &ldquo;science.&rdquo; He demonstrates that Kahn offers little more than propaganda for the war machine in the form of his own &ldquo;expert&rdquo; opinions. The fact that Kahn provides no evidence to support his claims serves as further proof for Chomsky&rsquo;s allegations. Chomsky calls the work of social scientists like Kahn &ldquo;absurdities.&rdquo; He makes it clear that he views Kahn&rsquo;s book as yet another intellectual tool for garnering public support of government-sponsored violence.</p><hr><a href=#quotes><h1 id=quotes><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Quotes</h1></a><ol><li></li></ol><p> >Intellectuals are in a position to expose the lies. </p><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Responsibility-of-Intellectuals/key-figures/#Noam_Chomsky rel=noopener>Noam Chomsky</a></p><p>Chomsky&rsquo;s central contention is that intellectuals have a responsibility to expose lies and to reveal truth.

Chomsky suggests that American intellectuals concerned for the citizens in developing nations have a duty to work to improve global social and economic conditions.</p><ol start=15><li></li></ol><blockquote><p> Our power placed us above the rest. </p></blockquote><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Responsibility-of-Intellectuals/key-figures/#Winston_Churchill rel=noopener>Winston Churchill</a></p><p>British Prime Minister Winston Churchill (1874–1965) explains to the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin (1878–1953) that power belongs to those &ldquo;dwelling at peace.&rdquo; He warns that people who are starved for power &ldquo;would always be a danger&rdquo; to the rest of the world. Chomsky applies this line of reasoning to analyze America&rsquo;s actions in the Vietnam War (1954–75). He suggests that America&rsquo;s self-interest and thirst for power poses a threat to the rest of the world.</p><hr><a href=#glossary><h1 id=glossary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Glossary</h1></a><p><strong>bureaucrat:</strong> <em>(n)</em> a government official concerned primarily with filing paperwork and following a set of procedures that adhere to legal requirements rather than on serving the people</p><p><strong>communism:</strong> <em>(n)</em> a political and economic system that emphasizes equality and the sharing of goods and property</p><p><strong>consequentialist:</strong> <em>(adj)</em> concerned with the outcome of actions</p><p><strong>elite:</strong> <em>(n)</em> a person or group in a position of authority who enjoys power and privilege over others within a society</p><p><strong>ideology:</strong> <em>(n)</em> a group of interconnected ideas that undergirds political theories</p><p><strong>naiveté:</strong> <em>(n)</em> the quality of being simple and uninformed</p><p><strong>paradox:</strong> <em>(n)</em> an idea that seems illogical even though it is based on valid reasoning</p><p><strong>privatization:</strong> <em>(n)</em> the transfer of publicly owned property to individual owners</p><p><strong>propaganda:</strong> <em>(n)</em> rumors and ideas that are deliberately communicated as a means of promoting a specific agenda</p><p><strong>pseudoscience:</strong> <em>(n)</em> any method that claims to offer scientific conclusions without providing any verifiable evidence</p><p><strong>utopian:</strong> <em>(adj)</em> possessing unrealistically perfect conditions</p><hr><a href=#biography><h1 id=biography><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span> Biography</h1></a><a href=#early-life-and-education><h4 id=early-life-and-education><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Early Life and Education</h4></a><p>Noam Chomsky was born on December 28, 1928, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His work in linguistics first earned acclaim after he pioneered a theory of innate grammar known as essentialism. Essentialism holds that the structures of grammar are built into the brain and that grammar is not acquired like vocabulary.</p><p>Chomsky earned a Ph.D. in linguistics from the University of Pennsylvania in 1955. He accepted a teaching position at the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) the following year in 1956. His book <em>Syntactic Structures</em> (1957) discussed linguistic grammar and served as the springboard for the launch of a graduate program in linguistics at MIT. Chomsky&rsquo;s publication of <em>Aspects of the Theory of Syntax</em> (1965) and <em>Cartesian Linguistics</em> (1966) helped to increase his popularity among scholars of linguistics across the globe.</p><a href=#principles-and-parameters><h4 id=principles-and-parameters><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Principles and Parameters</h4></a><p>Chomsky introduced a framework for understanding his essentialist ideas about grammatical structures in <em>Lectures on Government and Binding</em> (1981) and <em>Knowledge of Language</em> (1986)<em>.</em> Chomsky asserted that there are universal linguistic features shared by all minds that include both &ldquo;principles and parameters.&rdquo; Principles govern the general structure of language learning, and parameters contribute to variations within particular instances of learning. Chomsky also articulated a detailed account of the system he called &ldquo;universal grammar.&rdquo; He argued that universal grammar was at the root of all language learning. By the 1990s, his ideas about the complex structure of language gradually evolved into a more streamlined theory of language acquisition.</p><a href=#politics><h4 id=politics><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Politics</h4></a><p>Chomsky&rsquo;s political involvement began in 1964 when he publicly opposed the Vietnam War (1954–75), which involved the fight over communism in North Vietnam. Chomsky critiqued the United States&rsquo; involvement in Vietnam and shared his opposition to the war in the magazine <em>The New York Review of Books</em>. His article &ldquo;The Responsibility of Intellectuals&rdquo; (1967) accused prominent scholars and politicians of lying to the public to garner support for the war. Chomsky maintained that the United States was using aggression in Vietnam to advance its interests in increasing its control in Asia. He argued that intellectuals and scholars have a duty to clearly communicate political facts to ordinary citizens. He viewed intellectuals as uniquely positioned to challenge misconceptions and to correct political misunderstandings. Chomsky&rsquo;s work continues to be relevant in an age in which widespread misinformation campaigns plague social media and other alternative sources of news and information.</p><a href=#retirement-and-later-years><h4 id=retirement-and-later-years><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Retirement and Later Years</h4></a><p>Chomsky earned a full professorship at MIT in 1961. He retired as an emeritus professor in 2002. Chomsky continues to engage in political discussions and frequently speaks out against corporate power and income inequality in America. He is a popular proponent of progressive political action to empower ordinary Americans. His book <em>Requiem for the American Dream: The Ten Principles of Concentration of Wealth and Power</em> (2017) details the rise and fall of the big banks. <em>Climate Crisis and the Global Green New Deal</em> (2020) advocates for dramatic measures that may slow the rate of global climate change.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://potatomat0.github.io/obsidian-public-vault/js/graph.6579af7b10c818dbd2ca038702db0224.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Nhat Hoang © 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://potatomat0.github.io/obsidian-public-vault/>Home</a></li><li><a href=http://nhatkothieunang.web.app/>Other hobby links</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/potatomat0/obsidian-public-vault>GitHub</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
