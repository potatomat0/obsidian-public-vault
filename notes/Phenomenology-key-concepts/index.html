<a href=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/phenomenology/ rel=noopener>Phenomenology (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)</a></p><p>related notes:</p><ul><li><a href=/obsidian-public-vault/notes/Existentialism-stanford-encyclopedia-of-philosophy rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/obsidian-public-vault/notes/Existentialism-stanford-encyclopedia-of-philosophy>Existentialism - stanford encyclopedia of philosophy</a></li><li><a href=/obsidian-public-vault/notes/Metaphysics-key-concepts rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/obsidian-public-vault/notes/Metaphysics-key-concepts>Metaphysics key concepts</a></li></ul><hr><a href=#definition><h2 id=definition><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Definition</h2></a><p>Phenomenology is a philosophical movement that studies the structures of experience and consciousness. It was founded in the early 20th century by Edmund Husserl, and has since been developed by a number of other philosophers, including Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Jean-Paul Sartre.</p><p>One of the key concepts in phenomenology is intentionality, which is the idea that consciousness is always directed towards something. When we see a tree, for example, our consciousness is directed towards the tree itself. This means that consciousness is not simply a passive recipient of stimuli, but rather an active process of meaning-making.</p><p>Another key concept in phenomenology is the idea of <strong>the lifeworld</strong>. The lifeworld is the realm of our everyday experiences, including our perceptions, thoughts, feelings, and actions. It is the world as we experience it, rather than the world as it is in itself.</p><p>There are a number of different approaches to phenomenology, but some of the most popular include:</p><ul><li><strong>Transcendental phenomenology:</strong>Â This approach, developed by Husserl, seeks to bracket out all of our presuppositions about the world in order to get to the pure structures of experience.</li><li><strong>Existential phenomenology:</strong>Â This approach, developed by Heidegger and Sartre, focuses on the lived experience of human existence.</li><li><strong>Hermeneutic phenomenology:</strong>Â This approach, developed by Merleau-Ponty, emphasizes the role of interpretation in our experience of the world.</li></ul><p>Some of the key figures in phenomenology and their theories include:</p><ul><li><strong>Edmund Husserl:</strong>Â Husserl is considered the founder of phenomenology. His most important work isÂ <strong>Ideas: General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology</strong>Â (1913).</li><li><strong>Martin Heidegger:</strong>Â Heidegger was a student of Husserl&rsquo;s, and his work developed in a number of different directions. His most important work isÂ <strong>Being and Time</strong>Â (1927).</li><li><strong>Maurice Merleau-Ponty:</strong>Â Merleau-Ponty was a student of Husserl&rsquo;s and Heidegger&rsquo;s, and his work is often seen as a synthesis of the two approaches. His most important work isÂ <strong>Phenomenology of Perception</strong>Â (1945).</li><li><strong>Jean-Paul Sartre:</strong>Â Sartre was a student of Husserl&rsquo;s and Heidegger&rsquo;s, and his work is often seen as an existentialist interpretation of phenomenology. His most important work isÂ <strong>Being and Nothingness</strong>Â (1943).</li></ul><p>Phenomenology has had a significant impact on a number of different fields, including philosophy, psychology, sociology, anthropology, and literary criticism. It is a complex and challenging philosophy, but it offers a unique way of understanding the world and our place in it.</p><p>Here are some examples of how phenomenology can be used in practice:</p><ul><li>A psychologist might use phenomenology to study the experience of a particular mental illness.</li><li>A sociologist might use phenomenology to study the experience of living in a particular social group.</li><li>An anthropologist might use phenomenology to study the experience of a particular culture.</li><li>A literary critic might use phenomenology to study the experience of reading a particular text.</li></ul><p>Phenomenology is a powerful tool for understanding the human experience, and it can be applied to a wide range of topics. If you are interested in learning more about phenomenology, I recommend starting with the works of Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty.</p><a href=#relation-with-other-ideology><h2 id=relation-with-other-ideology><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>relation with other ideology</h2></a><p>Phenomenology has been influenced by and has influenced a number of other branches of philosophy, including:</p><ul><li><strong><a href=/obsidian-public-vault/notes/Epistemology-key-concepts rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/obsidian-public-vault/notes/Epistemology-key-concepts>Epistemology</a>:</strong>Â Phenomenology is concerned with the structures of experience, and this has led to a number of insights into the nature of knowledge. For example, phenomenology has helped to show that knowledge is not simply a matter of passively receiving information, but rather an active process of meaning-making.</li><li><strong><a href=/obsidian-public-vault/notes/Metaphysics-key-concepts rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/obsidian-public-vault/notes/Metaphysics-key-concepts>Metaphysics</a></strong> Phenomenology is also concerned with the nature of reality, and this has led to a number of debates about the relationship between consciousness and the world. For example, some phenomenologists have argued that consciousness is the foundation of reality, while others have argued that consciousness is simply a product of the world.</li><li><strong><a href=/obsidian-public-vault/notes/Existentialism-stanford-encyclopedia-of-philosophy rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/obsidian-public-vault/notes/Existentialism-stanford-encyclopedia-of-philosophy>existentialism</a></strong>Â Phenomenology has been a major influence on existentialism, which is a philosophical movement that focuses on the individual&rsquo;s experience of existence. Existentialists have drawn on phenomenology to argue that we are free to create our own meaning in life, and that we are responsible for our own choices.</li><li><strong>Hermeneutics:</strong>Â Hermeneutics is the study of interpretation, and phenomenology has been influential in the development of hermeneutics. For example, phenomenology has helped to show that interpretation is not simply a matter of applying rules, but rather an active process of understanding.</li></ul><p>In addition to these branches of philosophy, phenomenology has also been influenced by and has influenced a number of other disciplines, including psychology, sociology, anthropology, and literary criticism.</p><p>Phenomenology is a complex and multifaceted philosophy, and it has had a significant impact on a wide range of disciplines. It is a powerful tool for understanding the human experience, and it continues to be a vibrant area of philosophical research.</p><a href=#the-rejection-of-phenomenology><h2 id=the-rejection-of-phenomenology><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The rejection of phenomenology</h2></a><p>Some of the most notable critics of phenomenology include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Ludwig Wittgenstein:</strong>Â Wittgenstein was a 20th-century philosopher who argued that phenomenology is a form of &ldquo;private language,&rdquo; which is not possible. He argued that we can only understand language in terms of its use in the world, and that phenomenology&rsquo;s focus on the individual&rsquo;s subjective experience is ultimately misguided. read more on <a href=/obsidian-public-vault/notes/Ludwig-Wittgensteins-Tractatus-Logico-Philosophicus-Study-Guide-Coursehero rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/obsidian-public-vault/notes/Ludwig-Wittgensteins-Tractatus-Logico-Philosophicus-Study-Guide-Coursehero>Ludwig Wittgenstein&rsquo;s Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus Study Guide - Coursehero</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Gilbert Ryle:</strong>Â Ryle was a 20th-century philosopher who argued that phenomenology is a form of &ldquo;mentalism,&rdquo; which is the view that the mind is a separate substance from the body. He argued that the mind is not a separate substance, but rather a collection of mental states, which are embodied in the body.</p></li><li><p><strong>Noam Chomsky:</strong>Â Chomsky is a 20th-21st century linguist and philosopher who argued that phenomenology is not a scientific discipline. He argued that phenomenology does not provide falsifiable hypotheses, and that it is therefore not possible to test its claims.</p></li></ul><p>These are just a few of the philosophers who have rejected the idea of phenomenology. There are many other philosophers who have criticized phenomenology, and there is still a great deal of debate about the merits of this philosophical movement.</p><p>However, it is important to note that even some of the most vocal critics of phenomenology have acknowledged its contributions to philosophy. For example, Wittgenstein once said that &ldquo;phenomenology is a valuable strand in the history of philosophy,&rdquo; and Ryle acknowledged that phenomenology had &ldquo;made some valuable contributions to our understanding of the mind.&rdquo;</p><a href=#chomsky-on-phenomenology><h2 id=chomsky-on-phenomenology><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chomsky on phenomenology</h2></a><p>Noam Chomsky is a linguist and philosopher who has been a vocal critic of phenomenology. He has argued that phenomenology is not a scientific discipline, and that it does not provide falsifiable hypotheses. He has also argued that phenomenology is based on a number of flawed assumptions, including the assumption that consciousness is a separate substance from the body.</p><p>In his book <strong>Language and Mind</strong>, Chomsky writes:</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;The phenomenological approach to the mind is not a scientific approach. It is not based on any clear criteria for evaluating hypotheses, and it does not provide any way to test its claims. In fact, the phenomenological approach is based on a number of assumptions that are simply false. For example, the phenomenologists assume that consciousness is a separate substance from the body, and that it can be studied independently of the body. This assumption is simply false.&rdquo;</p></blockquote><p>Chomsky has also argued that phenomenology is not a useful tool for understanding the mind. He has said that &ldquo;the phenomenological approach has not led to any significant advances in our understanding of the mind,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;it is simply not a productive way to study the mind.&rdquo;</p><p>Chomsky&rsquo;s criticisms of phenomenology have been influential, and they have helped to shape the way that many philosophers think about this philosophical movement. However, it is important to note that there are also many philosophers who disagree with Chomsky&rsquo;s criticisms. Some philosophers argue that phenomenology is a valuable tool for understanding the mind, even if it is not a scientific discipline. Others argue that phenomenology is not based on any false assumptions, and that it can be a productive way to study the mind.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://potatomat0.github.io/obsidian-public-vault/js/graph.6579af7b10c818dbd2ca038702db0224.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Nhat Hoang Â© 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://potatomat0.github.io/obsidian-public-vault/>Home</a></li><li><a href=http://nhatkothieunang.web.app/>Other hobby links</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/potatomat0/obsidian-public-vault>GitHub</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
