In the author&rsquo;s view, philosophy has been tainted by Christian and Platonic (referring to the Greek philosopher Plato) ideas since the Roman Empire first embraced Christianity. In his view the hypocritical &ldquo;slave morality&rdquo; of Christian Europe imposes a limited perspective on society and is responsible for a new norm of mediocrity. Nietzsche believes that the new philosopher must push philosophy beyond the absolutes of good and evil to incorporate new thinking that supports the higher development of humanity. These free spirits will not only overcome useless paradigms but will also conquer their own weaknesses to pursue knowledge and uncover as many truths as they can bear. Most of the ideas in <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> appear in other books by Nietzsche, such as <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em>_,_ but this text is perhaps the clearest, as well as the most systematic, presentation of his ideas.</p><a href=#perspective-and-narrator><h3 id=perspective-and-narrator><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Perspective and Narrator</h3></a><p>The text <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> is written in the third person, but the author sometimes refers to himself and sometimes to the reader.

All living things seek &ldquo;above all to <em>discharge</em> [their] strength,&rdquo; says Nietzsche. &ldquo;Life itself is <em>essentially</em> appropriation, injury, overpowering of what is alien and weaker, suppression, hardness, imposition of one&rsquo;s own forms, in-corporation,&rdquo; according to the philosopher. The will to power wishes to &ldquo;grow, spread, seize, become predominant,&rdquo; not out of any feelings of morality or immorality but because it is natural for it to do so. Based on this idea that people naturally wish to predominate, he fashions the theory of master and slave moralities. The master morality reflects early aristocratic societies in which the strong had full rein to exercise their will to power, while the slave morality arose from the weaker people who were subjugated. The only choice they had was to turn their will to power inward as <em>ressentiment</em>, or spiteful hatred of their oppressors, which they had to suppress or direct into some other channel—often with the help of religion.</p><p>In Nietzsche&rsquo;s view, slave morality is the morality of the weak, who had to make themselves humble, patient, kind, and compassionate to cope with the masters—the aristocrats who had control over their lives. In Nietzsche&rsquo;s view, in the centuries after Christianity displaced the religions of the Roman Empire, Christianity enforced the morality of subjugation and kept people in line. But as religion lost its hold, philosophers sought to create a secular underpinning and justification for the prevailing morality. Thus, Nietzsche sees the history of Western philosophy as a continuation of a justification for slave morality.</p><p>Philosophical thinking is the most spiritual expression of the will to power.

He is an unsystematic philosopher because he has no faith in systems. His position is that life is in flux and truth is a moving target. It is impossible to know some &ldquo;objective&rdquo; truth because objective truth does not exist in Nietzsche&rsquo;s view, even though philosophers and free spirits cannot help but seek knowledge, and knowledge generally is thought to lead to some type of truth or other. In fact, he does not believe the philosophers who came before him were seeking truth; rather, they were seeking to create a justification for their moral worldview. The free spirit and the philosopher of tomorrow do not get attached to one perspective but attempt to investigate as many perspectives as possible to reach into the heart of existence.</p><p>Traditional metaphysical thinking has nurtured &ldquo;the faith of opposites&rdquo;—moral and immoral, good and evil, real and apparent, immanent and transcendent, material and immaterial, truth and falsehood. This is a &ldquo;frog perspective,&rdquo; the view from the ground. Nietzsche wants philosophy to get above frog perspective and false polarities of opposites in attempting to understand the world. Nietzsche doesn&rsquo;t mind &ldquo;fictions of logic,&rdquo; but he would rather philosophers were more honest about their fictions, which they need to render life coherent and meaningful, and that they would create fictions that are &ldquo;life-preserving&rdquo; and &ldquo;species-preserving.&rdquo; Thus, in Nietzsche&rsquo;s view, every perspective is in part a falsehood, and it would be better if philosophers would admit that they sell the world a shoddy bill of goods.</p><a href=#the-noble-man><h2 id=the-noble-man><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Noble Man</h2></a><p>Two moralities exist in the world, of master and slave. Nietzsche&rsquo;s view is that moral discrimination began with the rulers, who separated themselves from the slaves—the people they subjected. The original aristocrats of ancient cultures were these noble men, the strong who subdued the weak. In this stage &ldquo;good&rdquo; and &ldquo;bad&rdquo; meant the same as &ldquo;noble&rdquo; and &ldquo;contemptible.&rdquo; The nobles experienced themselves as good and their slaves as contemptible or bad. The nobles determined values, and they admired strength, courage, cunning, daring, all characteristics that expressed their will to power. They did not respect compassion nor pity, the characteristics of the slave. They might offer assistance to someone, not out of charity but rather out of a feeling of excess of their will to power. The noble man was never vain, Nietzsche says, because he already had so much respect for himself and did not need the approval of others. In Nietzsche&rsquo;s view Europe rejected the values of the nobles once Christianity conquered the Roman Empire and instead took on the values of the slaves, the practitioners of Christianity. He believes that these values continue to taint Western philosophy.</p><p>Nietzsche also asks what the word &ldquo;noble&rdquo; can mean in modern society, at the beginning of the democratic age, which he sees as a continuation of Christianity. Nietzsche answers, &ldquo;<em>The noble soul has reverence for itself</em>.&rdquo; This is true regardless of whether the noble one earns name and fame. Today&rsquo;s noble is akin to a free spirit or a true philosopher—someone who is willing to deeply question their own presuppositions in their interrogation of reality. Today&rsquo;s noble turns the will to power on themselves in a genuine quest for knowledge and a desire to overcome themselves. The free spirit or the philosopher wishes to reach to the level of an overman.</p><a href=#the-free-spirit><h2 id=the-free-spirit><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Free Spirit</h2></a><p>At various times Nietzsche equates free spirits with new philosophers as well as the philosophers of tomorrow, and they have the characteristics of nobility, in that they exercise their will to power in an effort to overcome their own limitations. The free spirit says <em>Yes</em> to all of life—the &ldquo;good&rdquo; the &ldquo;bad&rdquo; and the &ldquo;ugly.&rdquo; They are not afraid to look down the barrel of life, as it were. Nietzsche sees himself as a free spirit, and he invites his readers to become free spirits, including them consistently by using the pronoun <em>we</em>. It is often the fate of the free spirit—the person who suffers profoundly to uncover the truth—to end up alone, misunderstood, and isolated. Such exceptional individuals are brave enough to face up to the fact that their toil in the realm of the mind is on some level futile—though necessary. Like Sisyphus of Greek myth, who must continue to roll his boulder up the hill every day, even though it falls down every night, the free spirits and philosophers must continue to say their partial truths, fully knowing that &ldquo;every philosophy is a foreground philosophy &mldr; [and] <em>conceals</em> a philosophy; every opinion is also a hideout, every word also a mask.&rdquo;</p><a href=#the-herd-morality><h2 id=the-herd-morality><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Herd Morality</h2></a><p>According to Nietzsche, the herd instinct has taken hold of Europe. The herd man is the descendent of the slave, and he glorifies those characteristics that make him tame. The herd extols the virtues of benevolence, consideration, moderation, pity, and the like. Traits such as initiative, daring, cunning, and courage, previously cultivated to protect society from enemies, are suppressed. Traits such as &ldquo;independent spirituality&rdquo; or the cultivation of solitude that puts a person above the herd also &ldquo;intimidates the neighbor,&rdquo; and such qualities are called &ldquo;evil.&rdquo; Meanwhile, mediocrity, in the form of submissive, conforming behavior, is honored.</p><p>In Nietzsche&rsquo;s view &ldquo;the democratic movement is the heir of the Christian movement,&rdquo; which promulgates the herd morality. Nietzsche classifies the anarchists and socialists as part of the herd, noting that when all become equal no one has rights. All three—democrats, anarchists, and socialists—share the &ldquo;religion of pity&rdquo; and threaten Europe with &ldquo;a new Buddhism.&rdquo; They put their faith in the community, in the herd. Nietzsche wants to throw down herd morality and have free spirits come forward who will cultivate leaders to take humanity to a higher level—they will create the conditions for the higher man to emerge.</p><hr><a href=#context><h1 id=context><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Context</h1></a><a href=#nietzsches-co-option-by-the-nazis><h2 id=nietzsches-co-option-by-the-nazis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Nietzsche&rsquo;s Co-option by the Nazis</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/author/ rel=noopener>Nietzsche</a> became the darling of the Nazi Party—a 20th century German nationalist movement that supported systemic racism—thanks to his sister Elisabeth, a virulent anti-Semite who was also friends with the family of German composer Richard Wagner. She met her anti-Semitic husband, Bernhard Förster, through the Wagners and later went to South America with him to found an anti-Semitic community in 1887. Nietzsche disapproved of her marriage to this man as well as her anti-Semitism. Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche, more than anyone, is responsible for Nietzsche being identified as an anti-Semite, even into the middle of the 20th century. Nietzsche went mad in 1889, and his sister returned from South America after her husband committed suicide that same year. At first Nietzsche was cared for in clinics, but he went home with his mother in 1890 and remained with her until her death in 1897. Elisabeth took charge of her brother for the last three years of his life, also taking charge of his works and establishing an archive at Naumburg, where they grew up.</p><p>Nietzsche&rsquo;s writings brought Elisabeth fame and money, and he had left behind unpublished manuscripts as well as voluminous notes never meant to be published. She took it upon herself to delete passages from his writings that she didn&rsquo;t agree with and add others. Most importantly, she created one book from his unpublished work called <em>The Will to Power</em>, which distorted his philosophical position. Elisabeth forged letters as well. She also identified him as an anti-Semite, and since she outlived him by many years (Nietzsche died in 1900), Elisabeth became the last word on his work until she died. When she died in 1935, German dictator Adolf Hitler attended her funeral. By then Hitler was the leader of the fascist German state that would be responsible for the Holocaust. Only after Elisabeth&rsquo;s death did scholars begin to uncover her distortions and forgeries.</p><p>The Nazis appropriated certain ideas within Nietzsche&rsquo;s philosophy that could easily be misunderstood when taken out of context. No doubt, because of his complexity combined with his sometimes incendiary style, the Nazis could point to statements Nietzsche made and identify him as an inspiration for their perverse cause. For example, they used his idea of the overman—whom they called the superman—and conflated that idea with the false notion of themselves as Aryans, an idea Nietzsche makes fun of in <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em>. While the continental Europeans largely underappreciated Nietzsche early on, the translations and lobbying of American German philosopher Walter Kaufmann restored Nietzsche to respectability in Great Britain and the United States.</p><a href=#nietzsches-friendship-with-richard-wagner><h2 id=nietzsches-friendship-with-richard-wagner><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Nietzsche&rsquo;s Friendship with Richard Wagner</h2></a><p>Although Nietzsche had heard Richard Wagner&rsquo;s music in his teens, he became a disciple in October 1868, when he first listened to a performance of two of Wagner&rsquo;s opera preludes. He met the composer less than two weeks later and discovered they were both disciples of the German philosopher Arthur Schoepenhauer. Wagner was also born in the same year as Nietzsche&rsquo;s father, who died before Nietzsche turned five. At age 24, after growing up in a household of women, Nietzsche gravitated toward a father figure. Nietzsche associated Wagner with the great classical Greek tragedians and thought he would recreate the kind of cultural climate in Germany in which great tragedy would be born again. This theory is part of Nietzsche&rsquo;s thesis in his first major work, <em>The Birth of Tragedy</em> (1872).</p><p>Richard Wagner was both a famous and controversial figure—a composer of operas but also a radical who had been exiled for a time for participating in a revolution. He was also a musical theorist, revolutionizing the method of operatic composition. He continues to be considered an important figure in music, and some musical historians say his <em>Tristan und Isolde</em> is the first piece of modern classical music. His strong views on nationalism and his anti-Semitism influenced the cultural climate of Europe, and Wagner himself was something of a cult figure.</p><p>Nietzsche had a falling out with Wagner and his wife Cosima in 1876 over a review Nietzsche wrote on Wagner and his music. In the review Nietzsche praised Wagner&rsquo;s music but disparaged his character, calling him a Minotaur in a labyrinth, an image that he uses in <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> in a more general context. Nietzsche may have grown tired of Wagner&rsquo;s outsized ego, and he was also disgusted with Wagner for returning to Christianity. During the same period, Nietzsche lost his admiration for Schopenhauer. In retaliation the Wagners began circulating nasty rumors about Nietzsche&rsquo;s sexuality. Afterward Nietzsche continued to mock Wagner in print, although he also continued to admire him in private. In <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> he both praises Wagner&rsquo;s genius in 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/part-8-summary/ rel=noopener>Part 8</a> but then faults himself for falling into his &ldquo;old loves and narrowness&rdquo; in embracing some &ldquo;hearty fatherlandishness&rdquo; in his praise of his old mentor. He also indirectly criticizes the Wagners for their anti-Semitism and nationalism in the same chapter. Still, Wagner cast a long shadow over Nietzsche, and as Nietzschean scholar Michael Tanner points out, Wagner is the person mentioned most often in the philosopher&rsquo;s writings and embodies for him an archetype of the German spirit—both positive and negative.</p><a href=#nietzsche-and-women><h2 id=nietzsche-and-women><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Nietzsche and Women</h2></a><p>The charge of misogyny has been laid at Nietzsche&rsquo;s door, based mostly on the derogatory remarks he makes about women in his books—with the worst of them perhaps appearing in <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em>. But as Nietzschean scholar and feminist Maudemarie Clark points out, these rants against women, feminism, and the &ldquo;eternal feminine&rdquo; are likely one of the philosopher&rsquo;s masks under which he hides his true intentions. Given the section that prefaces his attack on women at the end of 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/part-7-summary/ rel=noopener>Part 7</a>, it appears he is demonstrating to the reader that he is aware that his &ldquo;truths&rdquo; about women are mere prejudices. Maudemarie Clark argues that the misogyny in <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> is &ldquo;on the level of sentiment, not belief&rdquo; and that Nietzsche uses it to &ldquo;illustrate points he is trying to make about philosophy and the will to truth.&rdquo; She further suggests that Nietzsche is challenging feminists to exhibit the virtue of honesty he shows in exposing his misogyny. Nietzsche prefaces his statements about women with the caveat that he is expressing &ldquo;<em>my</em> truths,&rdquo; meaning his convictions, which by the tenets of his own philosophy are limited and one-sided.</p><p>Nietzsche did speak out against feminism in his time, but then again he also criticized just about everything else as well. According to Julian Young, who wrote <em>Friedrich Nietzsche: A Philosophical Biography</em> (2010), Nietzsche was actually sympathetic to the feminist cause until he was rejected by Lou Salomé, a young Russian woman he fell in love with. Nonetheless, almost all of the women he was friends with after 1883 were feminists, including his earliest English translator, Helen Zimmern. Moreover, feminist scholars have been drawn to his work because of his message of human liberation. This is not to say that Nietzsche did not have ambivalent feelings about women; he certainly did. Like most people, Nietzsche was a collection of contradictions, and given his breadth of intellect, his contradictions would have been complicated. But it is clearly a mistake to paint him categorically as anti-female.</p><a href=#translations-of-nietzsche><h2 id=translations-of-nietzsche><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Translations of Nietzsche</h2></a><p>According to Nietzschean scholar Michael Tanner, Nietzsche was &ldquo;extensively, and mostly inaccurately, translated into English &mldr; in the early years of the 20th century,&rdquo; and no other translations were available for about 50 years. This also added to his tarnished reputation in the United States in addition to the charges of anti-Semitism because of his sister Elisabeth&rsquo;s propaganda. Walter Kaufmann, a German-Jewish immigrant and philosopher who landed at Princeton University after World War II, began translating Nietzsche&rsquo;s works. As a result, Nietzsche could now be accurately read by English and American scholars. Meanwhile in Europe, Nietzsche was widely read after World War II (1939–45) and studied by the existentialist philosophers and phenomenologists, such as Jean Paul Sartre and Martin Heidegger. While Walter Kaufmann&rsquo;s translations have been the definitive ones for many years, additional reliable translations are now available.</p><a href=#philosophical-sparring-partners-in_beyond-good-and-evil_><h2 id=philosophical-sparring-partners-in_beyond-good-and-evil_><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Philosophical Sparring Partners in <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em></h2></a><a href=#the-greek-philosophers><h4 id=the-greek-philosophers><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>The Greek Philosophers</h4></a><p>Nietzsche objected to Greek philosopher Plato&rsquo;s metaphysical ideas about the basis of reality: that anything in the world of appearance has a correspondence with a perfect archetype of that same thing in the world of forms. Moreover, Plato believed that the apparent reality was less real than the transcendental reality, which is immaterial. He also believed that people could get access to that &ldquo;real&rdquo; world through the exercise of reason. In <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> Nietzsche makes fun of Plato&rsquo;s idea of &ldquo;the Good,&rdquo; from which all other forms originate. He also disliked the Neo-Platonists, from whom, at the end of the 4th century, the Christians first borrowed the idea of a transcendental God. He admired Plato&rsquo;s teacher Socrates as an honest philosopher, and he clearly separates Plato and Socrates in <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em>, implying that Plato enhanced his teacher&rsquo;s ideas with the metaphysical concept of &ldquo;the Good.&rdquo;</p><a href=#descartes-and-spinoza><h4 id=descartes-and-spinoza><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Descartes and Spinoza</h4></a><p>René Descartes was an important French rationalist philosopher who invented &ldquo;Cartesian dualism.&rdquo; In this philosophy, Descartes proposed the idea that the mind and body are separate, discrete entities, and that one can exist without the other. Descartes sought to come up with a way to reconcile science and religion in his philosophy, but he never satisfactorily explained how his two substances interact in a human body. Nietzsche indirectly critiques Descartes when he deconstructs the idea &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; since Descartes was famous for the axiom, &ldquo;I think, therefore I am.&rdquo; For Nietzsche language often masks more than it reveals, which a philosopher can hardly take for granted. In <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> Nietzsche gives Descartes credit for being the father of rationalism, but he calls him superficial—not surprisingly—since Nietzsche does not accept his soul substance.</p><p>Dutch Jewish philosopher Baruch Spinoza was another rationalist who attempted to use mathematics to resolve the problems with Descartes&rsquo;s metaphysics—his idea of soul substance and the consequent split of the mind and body resulting from his dualism. In the process, Spinoza equated nature with God and got himself into trouble with both the Jewish and Christian authorities. Spinoza ends up with a form of rationalism tinged with mysticism when he concludes that humans do not have a privileged perspective and no more dignity than anything else in nature. Humans must come to love everything, meaning loving God, which he equates with knowledge of God. Nietzsche objected to Spinoza&rsquo;s mysticism and belief in God. In his writings Nietzsche accuses Spinoza of unclear thinking and rejects his attempt to use mathematics to support his metaphysics.</p><a href=#emmanuel-kant><h4 id=emmanuel-kant><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Emmanuel Kant</h4></a><p>German philosopher Emmanuel Kant sought to rescue the philosophy of rationalism from the British philosopher David Hume&rsquo;s radical empiricism, which argued that all human knowledge is based on the experience of the senses. Thus, knowledge must be traced back either to (1) direct perception or (2) abstract reasoning about ideas derived from experience. Hume claimed that all propositions are either analytic (matters of reason) or synthetic (matters of fact). Kant modified these ideas, coming up with the notion that there could be such a thing as <em>a priori</em> synthetic knowledge, or matters of fact that are known based on intuitive knowledge—such as knowledge of space and time. For Nietzsche, this smacked of metaphysics, as did Kant&rsquo;s &ldquo;categorical imperative,&rdquo; the idea that certain unconditional requirements exist and remain the same in all circumstances.</p><a href=#arthur-schopenhauer><h4 id=arthur-schopenhauer><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Arthur Schopenhauer</h4></a><p>In his writings, Nietzsche spends a lot of time disparaging philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer&rsquo;s ideas, but in fact his own philosophy owes a large debt to the pessimistic German. Emmanuel Kant had posited a &ldquo;noumenal,&rdquo; nonmaterial world behind the phenomenal world (derived through the senses rather than the mind), although he said human beings could not know it. Still, Kant was essentially an optimist and thought of the noumenal world as benign. Schopenhauer agreed with Kant that there was a reality behind the apparent world, but for him it was not pretty. Rather, he posited an inexorable force called &ldquo;will&rdquo;—both a creator and destroyer—which always want more and more. This <em>will</em> drives human beings in the service of procreation and destruction. Moreover, they are forever at its mercy. The best a human being can do in the face of this <em>will</em> is to get away from it briefly with respites of &ldquo;disinterested contemplation.&rdquo; For Schopenhauer, this can be accomplished by listening to certain types of music. Nietzsche uses Schopenhauer&rsquo;s concept of the will to fashion his own ideas about the will to power, which is also an inexorable force. However, Nietzsche posits it as something positive that should be embraced by human beings. He also does not attribute metaphysical qualities to the will to power, although it can be argued that the will to power has the scent of Kant&rsquo;s noumenal world. In a sense Nietzsche&rsquo;s philosophy is largely a counter-statement against Schopenhauer&rsquo;s pessimism.</p><a href=#british-utilitarians><h4 id=british-utilitarians><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>British Utilitarians</h4></a><p>The first of the British Utilitarians was Jeremy Bentham, followed by John Stuart Mill and others. Utilitarian philosophy was a system of ethics based on the principle that the best action is the one that is most useful to the greatest number of people. Utilitarianism presupposes the idea that happiness (well-being) is the highest value. Utilitarian ideas are diametrically opposed to Nietzsche&rsquo;s idea about the value of suffering as well as his dislike of herd morality. Nietzsche accuses the Utilitarians of being hypocrites and simply wanting to impose English morality on the world.</p><a href=#will-to-power-1><h2 id=will-to-power-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Will to Power</h2></a><p>A key idea in <em>Beyond Good and Evil,</em> as well as in many of Nietzsche&rsquo;s other works, is that the will to power is the driving force behind all of life and the most powerful instinct in a human being; the philosopher even gives it precedence over self-preservation, which he sees as merely an effect or by-product of the will to power. All living things seek &ldquo;above all to <em>discharge</em> [their] strength,&rdquo; says Nietzsche. &ldquo;Life itself is <em>essentially</em> appropriation, injury, overpowering of what is alien and weaker, suppression, hardness, imposition of one&rsquo;s own forms, in-corporation,&rdquo; according to the philosopher. The will to power wishes to &ldquo;grow, spread, seize, become predominant,&rdquo; not out of any feelings of morality or immorality but because it is natural for it to do so. Based on this idea that people naturally wish to predominate, he fashions the theory of master and slave moralities. The master morality reflects early aristocratic societies in which the strong had full rein to exercise their will to power, while the slave morality arose from the weaker people who were subjugated.

Traits such as &ldquo;independent spirituality&rdquo; or the cultivation of solitude that puts a person above the herd also &ldquo;intimidates the neighbor,&rdquo; and such qualities are called &ldquo;evil.&rdquo; Meanwhile, mediocrity, in the form of submissive, conforming behavior, is honored.</p><p>In Nietzsche&rsquo;s view &ldquo;the democratic movement is the heir of the Christian movement,&rdquo; which promulgates the herd morality. Nietzsche classifies the anarchists and socialists as part of the herd, noting that when all become equal no one has rights. All three—democrats, anarchists, and socialists—share the &ldquo;religion of pity&rdquo; and threaten Europe with &ldquo;a new Buddhism.&rdquo; They put their faith in the community, in the herd. Nietzsche wants to throw down herd morality and have free spirits come forward who will cultivate leaders to take humanity to a higher level—they will create the conditions for the higher man to emerge.</p><hr><a href=#summary><h1 id=summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-1><h2 id=summary-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><a href=#preface><h3 id=preface><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Preface</h3></a><p>The preface begins by asking a question: suppose truth were a woman? If she were, then philosophers who are dogmatists have done a poor job of winning her heart. Dogmatic philosophers lay down principles of truth and never stop to examine their own assumptions. Dogmatic philosophizing is childish and has used popular superstitions, such as religion and personal prejudices, to build philosophical edifices. The fault is with metaphysical philosophers who believe in an immaterial reality behind the material world. Such classical metaphysicians invent timeless principles that never change. To overcome these philosophical errors, it will be necessary to stand truth on her head and deny her a perspective. The fight against old ideas has created a tension in Europe, and it is now possible to use that tension to create something new—to use that tension like a bow to send a metaphorical arrow into a target in the future. 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/author/ rel=noopener>Nietzsche</a> implies that good Europeans—people willing to move beyond conventional notions of truth—and new philosophers may be able to reach the target; they may be able to create something new.</p><a href=#part-1-on-the-prejudices-of-philosophers><h3 id=part-1-on-the-prejudices-of-philosophers><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 1: On the Prejudices of Philosophers</h3></a><p>So far conventional philosophers put their faith in an either/or way of looking at life to assess value: good/bad, right/wrong, black/white, and so forth. Most conventional philosophers are advocates for their own prejudices, baptizing them as truths and not having the courage to admit they are merely preferences. In fact, every great philosophy is &ldquo;a kind of involuntary and unconscious memoir,&rdquo; based on the moral preferences of the philosopher.</p><p>After introducing the idea of a will to power without yet defining it, Nietzsche debunks the idea of both &ldquo;free will&rdquo; and &ldquo;unfree will&rdquo;—calling the first concept &ldquo;monstrous&rdquo; and the second &ldquo;a misuse of cause and effect.&rdquo; He concludes that there are only strong wills and weak wills. Some people cannot give up the idea that they are entirely free agents, while others wish to blame everyone but themselves when things go wrong. In these two extremes can be seen the two types of wills.</p><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/part-1-summary/ rel=noopener>Part 1</a> ends with the idea that psychology has gotten stuck in moral prejudices. In Nietzsche&rsquo;s view, a more balanced psychology would take into consideration the investigator&rsquo;s natural tendency to shy away from the idea that good and wicked drives might be interdependent. Nietzsche makes use of the metaphor of a boat sailing into dangerous and uncharted territory, sailing &ldquo;right <em>over</em> morality,&rdquo; yet entering a world of profound insight.</p><a href=#part-2-the-free-spirit><h3 id=part-2-the-free-spirit><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 2: The Free Spirit</h3></a><p>In 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/part-2-summary/ rel=noopener>Part 2</a> Nietzsche describes the qualifications of the true philosopher, whom he also calls the free spirit. &ldquo;Independence is for the very few; it is a privilege of the strong,&rdquo; Nietzsche says. The truth at times can be harmful and even kill a person, thus the strength of a person&rsquo;s spirit may be measured according to how much truth they can endure. The philosopher needs hardness and cunning, while the mere scholar can afford the luxury of being gentle and good-natured. Moreover, profound spirits need masks, meaning they must be able to disguise themselves, since what they say and do is often distorted, misunderstood, and misinterpreted. The test of the profound spirit includes the ability to detach themselves from loved ones, fatherland, pity, science, and even their own detachment or virtues. Generosity can be turned into a vice, for example, since the free spirit must conserve himself. Today&rsquo;s free spirits guard their solitude and hope that the new philosophers who succeed them will be kindred souls.</p><a href=#part-3-what-is-religious><h3 id=part-3-what-is-religious><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 3: What Is Religious</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/part-3-summary/ rel=noopener>Part 3</a> explains why Nietzsche thinks religion is pernicious, even though he also allows that religion can be useful. The philosopher calls the Christian religion a &ldquo;continual suicide of reason.&rdquo; The &ldquo;religious neurosis&rdquo; often manifests as &ldquo;extravagant voluptuousness,&rdquo; followed by remorse and &ldquo;denial of the world and will.&rdquo; In Nietzsche&rsquo;s view, religious people indulge themselves emotionally by carrying out religious cruelty, even as they turn their backs on the world and their natural desires. Thus Nietzsche says religion is a &ldquo;ladder of religious cruelty,&rdquo; in which first human beings were sacrificed to God, then sacrificed their &ldquo;animal&rdquo; nature, and finally sacrificed God himself, which Nietzsche sees as an ultimate act of nihilism—or the rejection of all human meaning. In the last part of this statement he is referencing Christianity and the death of Jesus on the cross, but he has equal contempt for Buddhism and faults the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer for being influenced by Eastern religious ideas.</p><p>Nonetheless, Nietzsche observes that religion serves multiple purposes. For example, asceticism and puritanism are means for religious aspirants to educate and ennoble themselves—even overcome themselves by internalizing the will to power. But religion for the majority of people teaches them to be contented with their lot in life.</p><p>Nietzsche maintains that Christianity and Buddhism side with suffering mankind and promote the idea that life is a sickness while attempting to suppress any other orientation toward life. In comforting the suffering, giving courage to the despairing, and supporting the dependent, these religions have preserved the worst in humanity. Nietzsche says that Christianity has turned man &ldquo;into a <em>sublime miscarriage</em>&rdquo; and Christian leaders of men have turned the European man into a &ldquo;herd animal, something eager to please, sickly, and mediocre.&rdquo;</p><a href=#part-4-epigrams-and-interludes><h3 id=part-4-epigrams-and-interludes><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 4: Epigrams and Interludes</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/part-4-summary/ rel=noopener>Part 4</a> of <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> is a series of 125 aphorisms (concise statements or observations) on a variety of subjects. The aphorism, a device frequently used by Nietzsche, is a seed thought from which many ideas can grow—in the mind of both the reader and the writer. The aphorisms for the most part stay on the subject matter of the overall text and often startle the reader into thinking about a belief or idea in a new way. These short, pithy maxims showcase the range and depth of the philosopher&rsquo;s thinking.</p><a href=#part-5-natural-history-of-morals><h3 id=part-5-natural-history-of-morals><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 5: Natural History of Morals</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/part-5-summary/ rel=noopener>Part 5</a> discusses the pros and cons of moral laws. Prior to Nietzsche&rsquo;s writings, philosophers have foolishly insisted on supplying &ldquo;a <em>rational foundation</em> for morality&rdquo; instead of attempting to describe types of moral behavior. Moreover, they tend to limit their moral investigations to their own experience and environment rather than compare moralities. Perhaps their biggest fault in their assessment is the fact that they never look at &ldquo;the problem of morality itself.&rdquo;</p><p>According to Nietzsche, every morality is a tyranny against nature and reason. Nonetheless, everything worthwhile about human culture owes its existence to &ldquo;capricious laws&rdquo;—laws and rules handed down by society. Obedience over a long period of time is necessary to develop virtue, art, music, dance, reason, and spirituality, as well as all other artifacts of culture. Moralities also serve to curb people&rsquo;s destructive passions. However, all moralities—regardless of time, place, and culture—generalize when people should not view themselves as &ldquo;unconditional.&rdquo; In Nietzsche&rsquo;s view, a herd morality was created in Europe by Christianity, and the democratic movements of his era are based on that same morality. Nietzsche wants to cast off herd morality and see free spirits come forward to take humanity to a higher level.</p><a href=#part-6-we-scholars><h3 id=part-6-we-scholars><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 6: We Scholars</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/part-6-summary/ rel=noopener>Part 6</a> compares scholars to philosophers and finds the scholars wanting. While genius &ldquo;<em>begets</em> or <em>gives birth</em>,&rdquo; a scholar is like an old maid—remaining respectable but barren. The ideal scholar is nothing more than an instrument, not an end in himself. Such people are mirrors and passageways; they avoid taking a definitive stand on a subject because they are fragile and inauthentic. The scholar is a &ldquo;sublime type of slave,&rdquo; but a slave nevertheless. While a philosopher sets aside skepticism when necessary, the scholar doubts everything and turns to a jellyfish in the face of <em>No</em> or even an emphatic <em>Yes</em>. The skeptic suffers paralysis of the will. The philosophers of the future will not be skeptics in this weak-willed sense. Rather, they will be able to say <em>No</em> and take things apart, know how to &ldquo;handle a knife,&rdquo; and use critics and scholars as their instruments.</p><p>Nietzsche says that genuine philosophers are commanders and legislators, and their will to truth is a will to power, meaning that they wish to impose their views on the world. Such philosophers will always find themselves in contradiction with the thinking of their own time period, in which they will appear as &ldquo;disagreeable fools and dangerous question marks.&rdquo; The philosopher holds as ideals a strong will and the ability to stand alone against the herd. Nietzsche calls such a person the &ldquo;higher man.&rdquo; Such a human being is &ldquo;beyond good and evil, the master of his virtues, he that is overrich in will.&rdquo;</p><a href=#part-7-our-virtues><h3 id=part-7-our-virtues><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 7: Our Virtues</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/part-7-summary/ rel=noopener>Part 7</a> raises questions about what is generally thought to be good or virtuous. Philosophies that measure the value of things in accordance with how much pleasure or pain they provide are misguided. To want to &ldquo;<em>abolish suffering</em>&rdquo; is &ldquo;insane,&rdquo; in Nietzsche&rsquo;s view. The new philosopher would rather heighten suffering; so-called &ldquo;well-being&rdquo; is not a noble goal, but rather makes man &ldquo;ridiculous and contemptible.&rdquo; All improvements in human beings so far have been achieved through &ldquo;the discipline of suffering.&rdquo; Through suffering the soul gathers strength, along with other virtues, and &ldquo;<em>creature</em> and <em>creator</em> are united,&rdquo; so that a person might fashion himself or herself according to their own preferential image. Nietzsche means that suffering is the crucible in which human beings may create and perfect a self. In his view, those who simply wish to have a comfortable life are simply contemptible; the philosopher or free spirit nobly pursues knowledge, even if that pursuit is accompanied by suffering.</p><p>Nietzsche says, honesty is a virtue from which free spirits—true philosophers—cannot escape. Therefore, he recommends that true philosophers perfect honesty, the only virtue left to them. Nietzsche admits that while learning changes a seeker, there is always something incorrigible in a human being that refuses education. One way to solve this problem is to find workarounds that people label &ldquo;convictions.&rdquo; Later they might realize those convictions were only the first steps to self-knowledge, &ldquo;signposts&rdquo; pointing to the &ldquo;problem&rdquo; that is each individual person.</p><a href=#part-8-peoples-and-fatherlands><h3 id=part-8-peoples-and-fatherlands><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 8: Peoples and Fatherlands</h3></a><p>Chapter 8 is a discourse on ethnicities and nationalities. After some preliminary statements about nationalism, which he calls &ldquo;fatherlandishness&rdquo; and &ldquo;soil addiction,&rdquo; Nietzsche turns to the democratization of Europe. This &ldquo;<em>democratic</em> movement&rdquo; is causing Europeans to become more like one another. These new conditions are leading to the &ldquo;leveling&rdquo; of the European, who is becoming more mediocre, but also more useful as a &ldquo;herd animal&rdquo;—easier to control and manipulate. At the same time this leveling will also produce some free spirits, &ldquo;exceptional human beings of the most dangerous and attractive quality.&rdquo;</p><p>The first group Nietzsche considers in depth is the Germans, and much of what he says is not flattering. Nietzsche continues with a number of sweeping statements about other European ethnicities and spends time condemning anti-Semitism and praising the Jews of Europe. Nietzsche ends these sketches of various ethnic groups by saying that despite people&rsquo;s nationalist feelings, there is a historical current afoot to meld the nations into one people. The most profound men of the century have prepared for this &ldquo;new <em>synthesis</em>&rdquo; of Europeans, he says, mentioning Napoleon, the French novelist Stendhal, and the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer among them, and even composer Richard Wagner, an ex-friend and mentor from whom he had become estranged.</p><a href=#part-9-what-is-noble><h3 id=part-9-what-is-noble><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 9: What Is Noble</h3></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/part-9-summary/ rel=noopener>Part 9</a> of <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> parses Nietzsche&rsquo;s ideas about order and rank in human society. He begins by declaring that any improvement in the human species has been made possible by an aristocratic society in which order of rank were assigned, along with value differences among people and the imposition of a form of slavery. Next Nietzsche asks the reader to face the truth about how culture began and how it progresses. He then lays out his analysis of how master and slave moralities evolved in ancient times, noting that the master morality promoted the exercise of the will to power, while slave morality promoted virtues such as compassion, pity, kindness, and humility because subjected people wish to stay alive.</p><p>After an extended discourse on this subject, Nietzsche asks what the word &ldquo;noble&rdquo; can mean in modern society now that democratic movements are following upon Christianity to further spread slave morality throughout Europe. He then applies his ideas of nobility to questing philosophers who use the will to power to overcome themselves in order to rise above their own prejudices and character weaknesses and discover new truths about life through their solitary endeavors.</p><p>Part 9 ends with a prose poem to the god Dionysus, &ldquo;the genius of the heart,&rdquo; who, among other things, &ldquo;smooths rough souls and lets them taste a new desire—to lie still as a mirror, that the deep sky may mirror itself in them.&rdquo; Dionysus is the Greek god of ecstatic vision. Nietzsche ends by comparing himself to a Chinese painter who attempts to immortalize the flight of a captured bird—but captures merely a shadow of the original once the image has been committed to paper. Such is also the case with his thoughts—the words that he writes can never reflect the true glory of his ideas.</p><a href=#from-high-mountains_aftersong_><h3 id=from-high-mountains_aftersong_><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>From High Mountains: <em>Aftersong</em></h3></a><p>The final part of <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> is a poem expressing Nietzsche&rsquo;s loneliness as he waits for kindred spirits to join him in the high mountains of his philosophical thoughts. When his old friends arrive, they cannot stay because they lack the capacity to live in his realm. They are not strong enough to endure the new philosophy. He continues to wait for new, stronger friends. Finally, Zarathustra, the sage of his previous book, arrives, and together they prepare to attend the wedding &ldquo;of light and dark,&rdquo; presumably relegating the philosophies of opposites to the dustbin of history.</p><hr><a href=#preface--summary><h1 id=preface--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Preface | Summary</h1></a><p>Nietzsche divides each Part into numbered sections. The author makes liberal use of italics and quotation marks in <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em>, so any italicized text that is enclosed in quotation marks or that is part of a quotation reproduces Nietzsche&rsquo;s original italics. Any text that uses single and double quotation marks reproduces words or phrases that Nietzsche himself had enclosed in quotation marks. Thus the single quotation marks represent Nietzsche&rsquo;s use of quotation marks in the original text.</p><a href=#summary-2><h2 id=summary-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p>Friedrich 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/author/ rel=noopener>Nietzsche</a> wrote <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> as a more straightforward, direct explication of many of the philosophical ideas that appeared in the earlier, allegorical <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em>, written in 1885. <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> also revisits the ideas that appeared in <em>Human, All-Too-Human</em> (1878). According to the <em>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</em>, the table of contents and themes in both texts are quite similar.</p><p><em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> asserts that it is the job of philosophers to use their imaginations and wills to create new values rather than simply follow &ldquo;mere scholars&rdquo; who continually regurgitate the same tired ideas. The narrator speaks directly to readers, often including them in his musing by using the first-person plural pronoun <em>we</em>.</p><p>The preface begins by asking a question: suppose truth were a woman? If she were, then philosophers who are dogmatists have been inexpert, attempting to use &ldquo;awkward and very improper methods&rdquo; for winning her heart. Dogmatic philosophizing is childish and has used popular superstition (for example, religious ideas or flimsy ideas hidden in words or grammar, or generalizations based on personal prejudices) to build its edifices. It seems that all worthwhile endeavors, such as philosophy, must first appear &ldquo;in monstrous and frightening masks&rdquo; to make an impression on humanity.</p><p>By dogmatic philosophers Nietzsche means metaphysical philosophers who posit there is an immaterial reality behind the material world. Such classical metaphysicians propose timeless principles that never change. The most dangerous error is that of the dogmatist—such as Plato&rsquo;s idea of &ldquo;pure spirit and the good as such.&rdquo; To overcome such an error requires &ldquo;standing truth on her head and denying <em>perspective</em>.&rdquo; The fight against Plato and Christianity—which is &ldquo;Platonism for &rsquo;the people&rsquo;"—has created in Europe a &ldquo;tension of the spirit&rdquo; that is new in history. To describe the situation in Europe, Nietzsche uses the metaphor of a very tense bow now capable of shooting an arrow at a very distant target. Europeans have previously responded to this tension with &ldquo;Jesuitism,&rdquo; and more recently with &ldquo;democratic enlightenment,&rdquo; but for &ldquo;we good Europeans&rdquo; and &ldquo;very free spirits,&rdquo; Nietzsche says, the tension has not abated. And perhaps such people—good Europeans and new philosophers—may be able to reach the target, the philosopher implies. This is a metaphorical target that exists in the future, and it represents the possibility of creating a higher man.</p><a href=#analysis><h2 id=analysis><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p>The opening question of <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> indicates that 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/author/ rel=noopener>Nietzsche</a>, like all philosophers, is concerned with truth—the age-old preoccupation of his occupation. But for Nietzsche, his colleagues by and large are dogmatists, and he sees himself as a prophet of sorts who has come to break the old mold of philosophy and usher in new ways of thinking. Sofia, or wisdom, is often personified as a woman, and she has been dealt with inexpertly and is not likely to yield to buffoons.</p><p>Nietzsche immediately identifies the &ldquo;popular superstitions&rdquo; upon which philosophy has relied and that he has spent a great deal of his career debunking: religion, for example, or any sort of metaphysics proposing a supersensible (above the senses) world beyond the palpable nuts-and-bolts world that people live in. Thus, Plato, whom Nietzsche admires to some degree, gets a drubbing for inventing the &ldquo;pure spirit,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the good as such,&rdquo; which he believed existed in the perfect world of forms upon which the real world is based. Nietzsche also objects to the idea of an &ldquo;objective&rdquo; good. Christianity is merely an extension of Platonism, in his view, and in fact Christianity owes its idea of a transcendent God to the philosophy of the Neo-Platonists of the first centuries of the Common Era.</p><p>In his writing Nietzsche also criticizes the religious ideas of the East. According to Vedanta philosophy, the world is unreal in the sense that the things of the world are subject to death, decay, and destruction. Additionally, Vedantins believe human beings can experience eternal and metaphysical oneness behind apparent creation through certain practices, something that Nietzsche would call a religious fiction. He objects to any view that disparages the sensible world while elevating a hypothetical metaphysical realm.</p><p>Nietzsche also attacks generalizations of other philosophers based on their pet ideas and personal preferences, something he will elaborate on later in the text. He notes that grammar and language itself create untruths, merely by coloring ideas with historical prejudices and falling short, because of their inherent limitations, of entirely conveying the nature of experience. He returns to these ideas in this text and elsewhere. In fact, Nietzsche was the first philosopher to emphasize the problem that language presents in a person&rsquo;s attempting to understand the nature of reality. For Nietzsche it will be necessary to stand truth on her head because he will argue that there is not one truth but only many perspectives. By denying truth a perspective, she will have to tell the truth. At the same time, she will be unable to do so without a perspective—at least if she is telling the truth according to the old rules. Thus, the preface introduces Nietzsche&rsquo;s <em>perspectivism</em>, which will be given considerable attention in the pages that follow.</p><p>Also introduced in the preface is the metaphor of the mask, which recurs throughout <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em>. Nietzsche argues that often what is valuable for humanity or an individual must be disguised with a mask, and he sees true philosophy as having been disguised for millennia by metaphysical thinking. Metaphysics is the branch of philosophy that explores &ldquo;first principles&rdquo; or fundamental reality. In Nietzsche&rsquo;s day it was closely aligned with religious assumptions that unseen, immaterial forces were at work in the universe. But he asserts that it is time to take off the mask. Nietzsche includes his readers, whom he imagines as sympathetic to his way of thinking, by using the pronoun &ldquo;we&rdquo; in his discourse. By referring to his readers, Nietzsche also sets up the expectation that they will immediately agree with him. He calls these kindred souls &ldquo;good Europeans&rdquo; and &ldquo;free spirits,&rdquo; terms that also become a kind of extended metaphor in <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em>. Together with the philosopher of this text, these free spirits may yet be able to release the tension created by false philosophy, sending forth an arrow that may reach the goal of a more clear-sighted, mature understanding of life.</p><hr><a href=#part-1--on-the-prejudices-of-philosophers--summary><h1 id=part-1--on-the-prejudices-of-philosophers--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span> Part 1 : On the Prejudices of Philosophers | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-3><h2 id=summary-3><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/author/ rel=noopener>Nietzsche</a> begins 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/part-1-summary/ rel=noopener>Part 1</a> by saying that &ldquo;the will to truth&rdquo; has laid many questions before philosophers. But who asks these questions, and what aspect of a human being wants truth? In essence where does this will to truth come from? Is it valuable? What if people preferred untruth instead? Can the opposite of something originate from its source—for example, can truth arise out of error or &ldquo;selfless deeds out of selfishness?&rdquo; Conventional philosophers claim that a thing of value must arise from &ldquo;the lap of Being.&rdquo; Such metaphysical thinking is at the root of philosophers&rsquo; &ldquo;logical procedures,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the fundamental faith of the metaphysicians is <em>the faith in opposite values</em>.&rdquo; The term <em>opposite values</em> refers to the either/or way of looking at life and assessing value: good/bad, right/wrong, black/white, and so forth. Nietzsche begs to differ, saying the conventional valuation of opposites are &ldquo;frog perspectives,&rdquo; meaning limited views of a small creature looking upward.</p><p>In Section 3 Nietzsche proposes that the &ldquo;greater part of conscious thinking must still be included among instinctive activities &mldr; even &mldr; philosophical thinking.&rdquo; Logic is guided by a desire to preserve &ldquo;a certain type of life.&rdquo; Judgment is only as good as the extent to which it is &ldquo;life-preserving&rdquo; and &ldquo;species-preserving&rdquo;; it matters less whether a particular judgment is true or not. To wit, without &ldquo;the fictions of logic &mldr; man could not live.&rdquo; A philosophy acknowledging the necessity of &ldquo;untruth,&rdquo; he writes in Section 4, would put itself &ldquo;beyond good and evil.&rdquo; On the other hand, most conventional philosophers advocate their own prejudices, baptizing them as truths and not having the courage to admit they are preferences. Nietzsche then cites the Tartuffery (hypocrisy) of Emmanuel Kant&rsquo;s &ldquo;categorical imperative,&rdquo; which is central to his moral philosophy, and the &ldquo;hocus-pocus of mathematical form&rdquo; claimed by Baruch Spinoza, who sought to justify his metaphysics with mathematical principles.</p><p>Similarly, the Stoics pretended to want to live according to nature, but Stoicism, like all philosophy that &ldquo;begins to believe in itself,&rdquo; wanted to recreate nature in its own image. For that reason, the discipline of philosophy is &ldquo;the most spiritual will to power,&rdquo; Nietzsche says. In fact, every great philosophy is &ldquo;a kind of involuntary and unconscious memoir,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the moral (or immoral) intentions in every philosophy&rdquo; are the seeds from which &ldquo;the whole plant [has] grown.&rdquo; Nietzsche does not believe &ldquo;&lsquo;a drive for knowledge&rsquo; is the father of philosophy&rdquo; but that, rather, other drives that wish to &ldquo;be master&rdquo; are behind philosophical speculation. Moreover, the morality of philosophers bears witness to who they are and what drives them.</p><p>Section 11 critiques portions of Kant&rsquo;s philosophy, and Nietzsche sarcastically references his <em>a priori</em> synthetic truth—a meaningful statement about reality whose truth may be known without observing empirical facts. Nietzsche makes fun of Kant and other German philosophers who were so pleased that Kant had &ldquo;discovered a moral faculty in man.&rdquo; Rather than ask Kant&rsquo;s question—&ldquo;How are synthetic judgments <em>a priori</em> possible?"—a better question is &ldquo;Why is belief in such judgments <em>necessary</em>?&rdquo; Nietzsche answers that the reason is for the sake of preserving &ldquo;such creatures like ourselves,&rdquo; even if these judgments are false. He then switches to a critique of &ldquo;atomism,&rdquo; specifically the &ldquo;<em>soul atomism</em>&rdquo; of Christianity, which claims the soul is eternal and indivisible, a belief that should be &ldquo;expelled from science!&rdquo; Nonetheless, the concept of a &ldquo;mortal soul&rdquo; or a &ldquo;soul as subjective multiplicity&rdquo; or &ldquo;a soul as social structure of drives and affects&rdquo; should not be banished.</p><p>Physiologists are wrong to think the instinct of self-preservation is most prominent in a human being; rather, it is the <em>will to power.</em> Will to power is the cause, and self-preservation is an effect. In this regard Nietzsche warns against superfluous teleological principles. Teleology is a method of attempting to understand something according to its ultimate goal or purpose. Nietzsche moves on to assert that science, like philosophy, is also an interpretation of the world, and it is not possible to grasp &ldquo;a thing in itself,&rdquo; or pure knowledge without the interference of either subject or object. Further, to say &ldquo;I think&rdquo; is customarily followed with a series of &ldquo;daring assertions&rdquo; that would be hard to prove: that it is &ldquo;I who think&rdquo;; that something is thinking; that thinking activity is created by a being who acts as a cause, and much more. Better to ask questions such as, &ldquo;From where did I get this concept of thinking? Why do I believe in cause and effect?&rdquo; and similar interesting questions that may be easily answered with glib metaphysics—but that do not uncover the truth.</p><p>In Section 19 Nietzsche attacks German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer&rsquo;s idea that the entirety of the will can be absolutely known to a person. While willing encompasses one ruling thought and has the effect of command, Nietzsche says it is &ldquo;a plurality of sensations.&rdquo; Further, the one who responds to the command experiences &ldquo;constraint, impulsion, pressure, resistance, and motion,&rdquo; but this multiplicity of &ldquo;I&rdquo; in that response is generally ignored and conflated into a &ldquo;synthetic concept of &lsquo;I&rsquo;.&rdquo; Thus, will and action appear together as one thing, but in fact they are not. In <em>willing,</em> there is commanding and obeying—whether of others or oneself. In both cases willing involves a &ldquo;social structure composed of many &lsquo;souls,&rsquo;&rdquo; and for that reason should be included &ldquo;within the sphere of morals.&rdquo; Nietzsche then defines morals as &ldquo;the doctrine of the relations of supremacy under which the phenomenon of &ldquo;life&rdquo; comes to be.&rdquo;</p><p>In Section 21 Nietzsche debunks the idea of both &ldquo;free will&rdquo; and &ldquo;unfree will&rdquo;—calling the first concept &ldquo;monstrous&rdquo; and the second &ldquo;a misuse of cause and effect.&rdquo; He concludes that &ldquo;in real life it is only a matter of <em>strong</em> and <em>weak</em> wills.&rdquo; Some people cannot give up their grandiose belief in themselves as free agents, while others wish to blame others for their actions, and in these two extremes can be seen the two types of wills.</p><p>Part 1 ends with the idea that psychology has gotten stuck in &ldquo;moral prejudices and fears&rdquo; and does not dare to &ldquo;descend into the depths.&rdquo; In Nietzsche&rsquo;s view a more balanced psychology must &ldquo;contend with unconscious resistance in the heart of the investigator,&rdquo; who will shy away from such ideas as &ldquo;the reciprocal dependence of the &lsquo;good&rsquo; and the &lsquo;wicked&rsquo; drives&rdquo; or the idea that &ldquo;the affects of hatred, envy, covetousness, and the lust to rule&rdquo; are &ldquo;conditions of life &mldr; [and] must be present in the general economy of life,&rdquo; meaning that these qualities also must be enhanced to enhance life. Nietzsche makes use of the metaphor of a boat sailing into dangerous and uncharted territory, sailing &ldquo;right <em>over</em> morality,&rdquo; yet entering a world of profound insight.</p><a href=#analysis-1><h2 id=analysis-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/author/ rel=noopener>Nietzsche</a> begins by interrogating the received notion, or an idea that is taken for granted, that human beings, particularly philosophers, desire truth. To do so Nietzsche must get underneath this idea, which is why he asks where the will to truth comes from and whether perhaps people prefer untruth—not exactly lies, but rather their biased assumptions that may not be borne out by the facts. This part is titled &ldquo;The Prejudice of Philosophers&rdquo; to point out that the so-called seekers of truth do not begin with a clean slate. In fact, they generally start with some sort of metaphysical agenda, in which all things that are good and have value must have an origin in something transcendent—an immaterial source, force, or being that is behind the manifest world.</p><p>By Nietzsche&rsquo;s time, in the last quarter of the 19th century, religion and philosophy had already parted ways enough to produce an empiricist philosopher like David Hume, who argued that all anyone could know was the data collected by the senses and that everything else was speculation, including the idea of selfhood. But metaphysics—the branch of philosophy that explores first principles or the ground of reality—still permeated philosophy and for the most part viewed first principles as unchanging. Nietzsche is at war with this view, which in his estimation blocks philosophical inquiry. The truth as such does not exist in Nietzsche&rsquo;s view, and those who wish to know reality should acknowledge that each interpretation of reality or each truth is merely a perspective. This notion, called perspectivism, can be said to be part of Nietzsche&rsquo;s metaphysics. Moreover, traditional metaphysical thinking has nurtured &ldquo;the faith of opposites&rdquo;—moral and immoral, good and evil, real and apparent, immanent and transcendent (material and immaterial), truth and falsehood. This is a &ldquo;frog perspective,&rdquo; the view from the ground. Nietzsche believes that it is time for philosophers to get above frog perspective and beyond the false polarities of opposites in attempting to understand the world.</p><p>Nietzsche doesn&rsquo;t mind the &ldquo;fictions of logic,&rdquo; but he would rather philosophers were more honest about their fictions, which they need to render life coherent and meaningful, and that they would create fictions that are &ldquo;life-preserving&rdquo; and &ldquo;species-preserving.&rdquo; He attacks certain philosophers particularly on the first count. Emmanuel Kant, for example, refashioned a key concept in David Hume&rsquo;s philosophy. Hume had argued that analysis was either <em>a priori</em> analytic (derived from reasoning or knowledge gained through theoretical deduction) or <em>a</em> <em>posteriori</em> synthetic (derived from reasoning or knowledge gained through observation and experience). Kant agreed with Hume but added a new category of <em>a priori</em> synthetic truths—meaningful statements about reality that could be known without observation. The faculty of reason is able to produce pure concepts, untainted by the senses, in Kant&rsquo;s view. Kant&rsquo;s metaphysics also includes the categorical imperative, which is an unconditional requirement that remains the same in all circumstances—in essence, a universal law—such as people should refrain from killing or stealing. Nietzsche is not entirely fair in representing Kant, who does admit that &ldquo;higher truths&rdquo; about reality are unknowable; Kant argues, however, that a belief in such truths is necessary to make existence bearable. Nonetheless, Kant&rsquo;s philosophy aligns perfectly with his Christian religious beliefs, which seems to support Nietzsche&rsquo;s assertion that the moral intentions of every philosophy are the seeds from which the system is grown.</p><p>Not surprisingly, thinking about Kant leads Nietzsche to think about Christianity and the fiction, in his view, that the soul is immortal and eternal. However, in typical Nietzschean fashion, the philosopher has it both ways and does not completely jettison the idea of an individual essence—although he thinks of the soul as finite and as a multiplicity of <em>drives</em> and <em>affects</em>, two words that he uses throughout <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em>. According to translator Walter Kaufmann, &ldquo;affekt&rdquo; (affect) in German means feeling, but in a philosophical text carries the overtones of Spinoza&rsquo;s &ldquo;affectus,&rdquo; which is a motivation to act stimulated by a feeling.</p><p>Nietzsche also introduces the &ldquo;will to power&rdquo; in this first section, which is a second important concept in his metaphysics. He argues that self-preservation is merely the effect of the cause—will to power. In Section 13 he says that all living things &ldquo;seek above all to <em>discharge</em> &mldr; [their] strength&rdquo; and that &ldquo;life itself is <em>will to power</em>.&rdquo; In Section 9 he says that philosophy is the most spiritual expression of the will to power. Nietzsche explicitly lays out his will-to-power doctrine for the first time in <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em>, according to the <em>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</em>, although his &ldquo;crusade against morality&rdquo; (Nietzsche&rsquo;s words in <em>Ecce Homo</em>) began earlier. Philosophers have continued to argue about the meaning of Nietzsche&rsquo;s doctrine, which seems to indicate everything in the world rests on a power base continually pursuing an expansion of its power. Another idea, says the <em>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</em>, is that the will to power is the drive to overcome resistance.</p><p>Nietzsche himself expresses his own will to power and desire to overcome his fellow philosophers by faulting them for presenting certain concepts as truths when they are no more than beliefs—for example, ideas about free will and polar opposites and an unwavering &ldquo;I&rdquo; consciousness. Although he doesn&rsquo;t mention René Descartes directly—famously known for coining the aphorism, &ldquo;I think, therefore I am&rdquo;—Nietzsche indirectly criticizes him and his followers for not locating self-consciousness in a matrix that includes both what is inside and outside the self. He scoffs at the notion of proving that the &ldquo;thinker&rdquo; is the cause of action or that it is &ldquo;I&rdquo; who thinks. For Nietzsche, I-consciousness is neither static nor unitary, and he asserts that each person is a plurality of conflicting thoughts and desires, just as will is a &ldquo;plurality of sensations.&rdquo; Similarly, obedience involves many parts of both <em>Yes</em> and <em>No</em>. Thus, it is not possible to talk about free will, but its so-called opposite of &ldquo;unfree will&rdquo; is not more helpful. Rather, Nietzsche finds it more useful to think about strong wills and weak wills, with the strong will able to overcome what is weaker.</p><p>Nietzsche ends this section by emphasizing that it is no small thing to transcend &ldquo;moral prejudices and fears&rdquo; and descend into depth psychology. Humans would prefer not to believe that so-called good and bad drives depend on each other, or that base emotions, such as hatred and envy, might actually play a role in enhancing life. Indeed, only the most fearless and intrepid philosophers can sail their boats beyond good and evil and enter into deeper waters—and a more complex apprehension (understanding) of reality.</p><hr><a href=#part-2--the-free-spirit--summary><h1 id=part-2--the-free-spirit--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 2 : The Free Spirit | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-4><h2 id=summary-4><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/author/ rel=noopener>Nietzsche</a> begins 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/part-2-summary/ rel=noopener>Part 2</a> by asserting that one thing may arise from its opposite; in fact, the will to knowledge has risen on the foundation of the will to ignorance, &ldquo;Not as its opposite, but—as its refinement!&rdquo; Having said that, Nietzsche warns philosophers to &ldquo;beware of martyrdom &mldr; of suffering &lsquo;for truth&rsquo;s sake &mldr; [and] of defending yourselves.&rdquo; In fact, truth does not require protectors; no philosopher &ldquo;so far has been proved right,&rdquo; and they would do well to put question marks after their favorite doctrines. They should conceal themselves and wear masks, veiling their true thoughts. They should avoid moral indignation and martyrdom, which can only end in degeneration and farce.</p><p>Every exceptional human being &ldquo;strives instinctively&rdquo; for a personal, secret citadel far from the madding crowd where they may forget ordinary people. But knowledge requires mixing with the unwashed masses, so it is necessary for the philosopher to come down from the citadel. Of special interest to the &ldquo;higher man&rdquo; are the cynics, who recognize their own animal nature and the &ldquo;commonplace&rdquo; in themselves. They are a worthy subject of study.</p><p>Section 27 distinguishes between those who think and live <em>gāngāsrotagati</em> (a Sanskrit term in essence meaning &ldquo;as the river current moves&rdquo;) from those who move like the turtle (<em>kūrmagati</em>) or the frog (<em>mandūkagati</em>). Nietzsche sees himself as a fast-tempo thinker, moving like the river. In the next section, he continues a discussion of tempo and accuses the Germans, generally, of being incapable of a rapid tempo: &ldquo;Everything ponderous, viscous, and solemnly clumsy, all long-winded and boring types of style are developed in profuse variety among Germans.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Independence is for the very few; it is a privilege of the strong,&rdquo; begins Section 29. If independence is attempted without &ldquo;inner constraint,&rdquo; a person enters &ldquo;a labyrinth&rdquo; of danger and may lose their way, become lonely, or may be torn apart by the &ldquo;minotaur of conscience.&rdquo; Moreover, there will be no pity for such a one who cannot be comprehended by the masses. The insights of such exceptional people should sound &ldquo;like follies and sometimes like crimes&rdquo; when inadvertently heard by the uninitiated with shallow understanding. Similarly, there are books meant for higher natures, and if they get into the hands of those with a &ldquo;lower soul&rdquo; they can cause &ldquo;crumbling and disintegration.&rdquo;</p><p>In the &ldquo;pre-moral&rdquo; period of humankind, the value of an action was determined by its consequences. Today, in certain parts of the world, the origin of an action determines it value—a step forward and an &ldquo;aftereffect of the rule of aristocratic values.&rdquo; Humankind is now paused on a threshold of the &ldquo;extra-moral,&rdquo; in which the value of an action lies in &ldquo;what is <em>unintentional</em> in it.&rdquo; According to Nietzsche, traditional morality judging intentions is merely a prejudice and something to be overcome. Also, to be &ldquo;taken to court&rdquo; must be the &ldquo;morality of self-denial&rdquo; and the &ldquo;aesthetics of &lsquo;contemplation devoid of all interest.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>According to Nietzsche today&rsquo;s thinking person knows that much of what they believe about the world is false. &ldquo;Faith in &lsquo;immediate certainties&rsquo; is a moral naïveté.&rdquo; While for an ordinary bourgeois (middle-class person), constant suspicion may be a sign of bad character, philosophers have &ldquo;a right to &lsquo;bad character&rsquo;&rdquo; and a duty to be suspicious. For example, that truth is worth more than appearance cannot be proved, nor can the idea that true and false are opposites. It would be better to acknowledge &ldquo;degrees of apparentness.&rdquo; Moreover, philosophers should be allowed &ldquo;to rise above faith in grammar.&rdquo;</p><p>Nietzsche asks the reader to imagine nothing else as a given except desires and passion—would this be enough to understand the world? In this thought experiment, the world is imagined as &ldquo;affects in which everything still lies contained in a powerful unity before it undergoes &mldr; developments in an organic process.&rdquo; The purpose of this experiment is to determine whether the will is recognized as &ldquo;efficient,&rdquo; whether or not it is believed to be causal. In fact, people do believe will is causal, but perhaps one underlying will affects all acts of will. Thus, perhaps instinctive life proceeds from this one will—the will to power.</p><p>The truth at times can be harmful and dangerous, and it could be that if a person knew the entire truth they might die; in that case, &ldquo;strength of spirit&rdquo; may be measured according to how much truth a person can endure. No doubt evil and unhappy individuals are more likely to discover parts of the truth. Perhaps the philosopher must be hard and cunning, while the mere scholar can afford the luxury of being gentle and good-natured. Nietzsche then quotes the French writer Stendhal who says that a good philosopher must be &ldquo;dry, clear, without illusion.&rdquo; Moreover, &ldquo;every profound spirit needs a mask: even more, around every profound spirit a mask is growing continually, owing to the constantly false, namely <em>shallow</em>, interpretation of every word, every step, every sign of life he gives.&rdquo; The tests of the profound spirit include not remaining attached to loved ones (&ldquo;every person is a prison&rdquo;), fatherland, pity, science, their own detachment, or their virtues, particularly generosity, which can be turned into a vice: &ldquo;One must know how <em>to conserve oneself</em>: the hardest test of independence.&rdquo;</p><p>The free spirits, the philosophers of the future, will be thoroughly different from their predecessors. They should not be mistaken for the current &ldquo;levelers&rdquo; who call themselves free spirits but are &ldquo;scribbling slaves of democratic taste.&rdquo; They may be &ldquo;good fellows,&rdquo; but they are &ldquo;unfree and ridiculously superficial.&rdquo; They wish to make life easier for the masses, believe in equal rights, and want to end suffering. Today&rsquo;s free spirits, however, believe that &ldquo;hardness, forcefulness, slavery, danger in the alley and the heart,&rdquo; and the like enhance the species as much as their opposites. Today&rsquo;s free spirits avoid the snares of the world—such as money and honors—and are grateful for all manner of experience furthering their knowledge. They guard their solitude and hope those new philosophers who will succeed them will be kindred souls.</p><a href=#analysis-2><h2 id=analysis-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/author/ rel=noopener>Nietzsche</a>&rsquo;s style of writing sometimes makes it difficult to immediately see how his thoughts are connected, since he doesn&rsquo;t bother to write transitions from section to section, and he doesn&rsquo;t use headings. Difficult, idiosyncratic, and dense, his writing is also layered and lucid. His ideas are organized, although that organization may not be immediately apparent. Now that he has critiqued the prejudices of philosophers in 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/part-1-summary/ rel=noopener>Part 1</a>, he sets out to draw a portrait of the new philosophers—the free spirits, himself among them—and how they will differ from the old philosophers.</p><p>First, free-spirited philosophers should not feel sorry for themselves. If the free spirit suffers, they suffer not for the truth but for themselves as they quest for knowledge because their task is not easy. If they are virile, they keep their suffering quiet. Free spirits are strong and should not waste time feeling indignant about what ordinary people say or do—otherwise they belittle their own vocation. Rather, they should conceal themselves as they work and find joy in their quest. While such people—Nietzsche&rsquo;s so-called exceptional human beings or the higher souls—may be tempted to shun society, their quest for knowledge requires that they study ordinary humans, and if they are fortunate enough to become acquainted with a cynic, all the better, since a cynic does not hide their worst side and can provide good intelligence on seamy part of human nature.</p><p>The free spirit&rsquo;s thought processes move like a quickly flowing river, and Nietzsche, an atypical German thinker in his own estimation, pauses to make a joke about his fellow Germans, who are ponderous and long-winded and proceed slowly, step-by-step. Nietzsche is taking a sideswipe at the German philosophers Emmanuel Kant and Arthur Schopenhauer—giants in the field of philosophy to whom Nietzsche is indebted, despite the fact that he unceremoniously kicks them to the curb. Nietzsche, who is not without a sense of humor, obliquely acknowledges his debt at the beginning of 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/part-2-summary/ rel=noopener>Part 2</a> when he says that the will to knowledge can rise out of the will to ignorance and is not its opposite but a refinement. Clearly, he sees himself as refining the thinking of those other ponderous Germans.</p><p>The philosopher now homes in on the free spirit, whose independence marks them among the few and the strong. Independent thinking is dangerous because it separates the free spirit from the herd. With few or no kindred spirits to commiserate with, the free spirit must battle their internal demons—the &ldquo;minotaur of conscience.&rdquo; The minotaur represents the unconscious mind or those thoughts that usually stay just below the surface of consciousness—often not very pretty and primitive thoughts, sometimes ugly emotions and desires. A free spirit willingly faces such thoughts, but without help in parsing the unconscious mind, he or she might be overwhelmed or &ldquo;torn apart.&rdquo; Not surprisingly, their insights may seem like crimes to the uninitiated—the ignorant who live on the surface of their minds and never plumb its dark depths. They can neither understand the insights of the exceptional person nor bear the truths the free spirit may bring back from the labyrinth after battling the minotaur.</p><p>Continuing on this train of thought, Nietzsche notes that in the days of pre-morality, the result of an action was the measure of its value. In a modern society imbued with moral values, the motive behind human action takes precedence. Thus, people will be punished for crimes according to their intentions. For example, someone who deliberately kills someone will get a much harsher punishment than someone who causes a death by accident. What Nietzsche says, however, is that such judgments are mere prejudices, that the true meaning of an action lies in the unconscious mind, beyond conscious intent. Almost everything people believe about the world is false, in the sense that people cling to a single perspective and therefore deprive themselves of a multitude of alternative truths that would become visible if they were not stuck in one way of seeing. Here Nietzsche is obliquely referring to perspectivism, which stresses the limitations of one point of view. Also limiting is a morality of self-denial or disinterested contemplation, because both activities are life-denying in Nietzsche&rsquo;s worldview. Disinterested contemplation is a Schopenhauerian idea that a person can have an aesthetic experience by suspending the will—an idea Nietzsche thought absurd. The free spirit embraces life and engages with it—there is no room for denial or detachment in this approach to living.</p><p>Since the free spirit starts with the notion that what they believe is likely false, they seem suspicious and lacking in good character, according to a conventional point of view. Why wouldn&rsquo;t they take things at face value unless they themselves could not be trusted at face value? But the free spirit reserves the right to interrogate received notions. Furthermore, such people understand how language itself becomes a barrier to truth, since it carries in its very grammar and syntax the prejudices and presumptions of a culture. Nietzsche was among the first philosophers to tackle the problem of language—specifically its role in shaping belief systems. Language assumes certain religious ideas and is laden with religious associations as well as primitive human psychology. This is something free spirits understand, which is why Nietzsche says they can rise above their faith in grammar—even if they can&rsquo;t rise above the grammar itself.</p><p>In Section 36 Nietzsche proposes a thought experiment to consider whether his will to power might in fact be a primary driver behind even will itself, presenting his concept in this instance as almost a metaphysical principle, similar to Kant&rsquo;s categorical imperative. But he does not repeat this formulation of the will to power elsewhere and perhaps realizes he has drifted into the metaphysical realm. The last sections of Part 2 reiterate that truth can be harmful and dangerous, yet the free spirit is free to pursue it to its end. The free spirit affirms all of life, even its dark underbelly.</p><hr><a href=#part-3--what-is-religious--summary><h1 id=part-3--what-is-religious--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 3 : What Is Religious | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-5><h2 id=summary-5><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/author/ rel=noopener>Nietzsche</a> slyly turns to an interrogation of the soul in Part 3—but in fact, what he means to do is interrogate religion and the religious sensibility. The soul is &ldquo;the predestined hunting ground for a born psychologist and lover of the &lsquo;great hunt,&rsquo;&rdquo; he says.</p><p>Section 46 tackles the Christian faith, and Nietzsche notes that what he has in mind is the original Western faith of Catholicism, which he says is a &ldquo;continual suicide of reason.&rdquo; The Christian faith is &ldquo;a sacrifice of all freedom, all pride, all self-confidence of the spirit; at the same time, enslavement and self-mockery, self-mutilation.&rdquo; According to Nietzsche the Modern European has become immune to the &ldquo;gruesome superlative that struck a classical taste in the paradoxical formula &lsquo;god on the cross.&rsquo;&rdquo; Nietzsche means that the central Christian image of Jesus on the cross would have been repulsive to the classical Greek or Roman sensibility. In Nietzsche&rsquo;s view, there has never been anything that has struck such a bold inversion, which &ldquo;promised a revaluation of all the values of antiquity.&rdquo;</p><p>The &ldquo;religious neurosis&rdquo; often manifests as &ldquo;extravagant voluptuousness,&rdquo; followed by remorse and &ldquo;denial of the world and will.&rdquo; But Nietzsche asks how it is possible to deny the will, and this seemed to be the question that made Schopenhauer a philosopher. Nietzsche again reminds the reader that he is talking primarily about Catholicism, not Protestantism. The religiosity of ancient Greece is touched on, and the he notes that the Greek religion included an &ldquo;abundance of gratitude,&rdquo; which is a noble attitude toward life. Unfortunately, at some point &ldquo;the rabble gained the upper hand in Greece, <em>fear</em> became rampant in religion, too—and the ground was prepared for Christianity.&rdquo; Nietzsche moves on to fault Saint Augustine for exhibiting an &ldquo;Oriental ecstasy worthy of a slave who, without deserving it, has been pardoned and elevated,&rdquo; and he ridicules the desire for mystical union with God. He juxtaposes these comments with praise for the &ldquo;Jewish &lsquo;Old Testament,&rsquo;&rdquo; for its grand speeches rivaling Greek and Indian literature, and faults Christians for creating the Bible from Christian and Jewish texts because their values are diametrically opposed. This leads him to think about the &ldquo;ladder of religious cruelty&rdquo; (referencing the &ldquo;voluptuousness&rdquo; he spoke about earlier) in which first human beings were sacrificed to God. This cruelty was followed by people&rsquo;s sacrifice of their &ldquo;animal&rdquo; nature to God. Last, they sacrificed God himself, which Nietzsche sees as an ultimate act of nihilism—or the rejection of all human meaning.</p><p>In Section 56 Nietzsche criticizes Schopenhauer for introducing the 19th century to his &ldquo;half-Christian, half-German&rdquo; pessimism—a &ldquo;world-denying&rdquo; philosophy. Nietzsche claims to have thoroughly thought through this pessimism, which has broken the spell of morality. He has &ldquo;opened his eyes to the opposite ideal.&rdquo; His ideal is &ldquo;world-affirming&rdquo; and accepts whatever is, so much so that a person holding this position wants to have &ldquo;<em>what was and is</em> repeated into all eternity&rdquo; because &ldquo;he needs himself—and makes himself necessary.&rdquo;</p><p>Nietzsche notes that religious life requires leisure, and the industriousness of modern people actually encourages &ldquo;unbelief.&rdquo; Modern people have other commitments—to business, pleasure, family, and the &ldquo;fatherland,&rdquo; with no time left for religion. Mostly they are no longer sure of religion&rsquo;s purpose. That being said, pious people do not realize how hard it is for German scholars &ldquo;to take the problem of religion seriously.&rdquo; Generally, the scholars exhibit tolerance and condescension when studying religion, but their tolerance is a form of naïveté, and Nietzsche implies that, in fact, such people are inferior to their religious counterparts.</p><p>On the other hand, there is much wisdom in superficiality, which is an instinct of self-preservation. Fear and pessimism are at the root of the religious worldview—&ldquo;fear of that instinct which senses that one might get hold of the truth <em>too soon</em>, before man has become strong enough, hard enough.&rdquo; Piety results from the fear of truth and the desire to invert the truth, no matter what it takes. Piety is the surest means for human beings to adorn themselves. Nietzsche says piety &ldquo;can turn man into so much art, surface, play of colors, graciousness that his sight no longer makes one suffer.&rdquo;</p><p>Religion serves multiple purposes. For example, small religious communities can give their rulers and disciples peace &ldquo;from the noise &mldr; of <em>cruder</em> forms of government.&rdquo; Asceticism and puritanism, says Nietzsche, are &ldquo;indispensable means for educating and ennobling a race that wishes to become master over its origins among the rabble.&rdquo; But religion teaches the majority of people to be contented with their lot in life. Religion and &ldquo;religious significance&rdquo; make human beings &ldquo;tolerable&rdquo; in their own sight. &ldquo;Perhaps nothing in Christianity or Buddhism is as venerable as their art of teaching even the lowliest how to place themselves through piety in an illusory higher order of things and thus to maintain their contentment with the real order,&rdquo; Nietzsche concludes.</p><p>Nietzsche ends his discourse on religion in Section 62 by pointing out how humanity pays terribly when religion is not kept in check by philosophers and becomes a ruling force—acting to become the &ldquo;ultimate ends and not means among other means.&rdquo; Among human beings, as with other animals, failure is the rule rather than the exception. In response to that fact Christianity and Buddhism side with suffering mankind and promote the idea that life is a sickness while attempting to suppress any other orientation toward life. The &ldquo;sovereign religions &mldr; have preserved too much of <em>what ought to perish</em>.&rdquo; In comforting the suffering, encouraging the despairing, and supporting the dependent, they have preserved &ldquo;all that was sick and that suffered&rdquo; and therefore worsened the European race. Thus, religion stood &ldquo;all valuations on their head,&rdquo; destroying what was strong and calling into question the joy that arises from experiencing beauty. Religion transformed traits like manliness and the will to conquer into insecurity and &ldquo;agony of conscience.&rdquo; According to Nietzsche Christianity has turned man &ldquo;into a <em>sublime miscarriage</em>&rdquo; and has been &ldquo;the most calamitous kind of arrogance yet.&rdquo; As a result, Nietzsche says that Christian leaders of men have turned the European man into a &ldquo;herd animal, something eager to please, sickly, and mediocre.&rdquo;</p><a href=#analysis-3><h2 id=analysis-3><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/author/ rel=noopener>Nietzsche</a> has already declared that the so-called soul is mortal in 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/part-1-summary/ rel=noopener>Part 1</a>, and in 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/part-3-summary/ rel=noopener>Part 3</a> he examines &ldquo;the human soul and its limits,&rdquo; ironically juxtaposing his own &ldquo;history of the soul&rdquo; with the tenets of two major religions West and East—Christianity and Buddhism. Thus, Nietzsche pits his atheism and mortal soul against the immortal soul of Christian belief and the timeless consciousness posited by Buddhist doctrine. More specifically, as he reminds the reader more than once, he interrogates Catholicism, not because he thinks it is worse than Protestantism but because it is more representative of the values that have shaped Europe.</p><p>Nietzsche specifically chooses Buddhism as the Eastern counterpart of Christianity because one of his major philosophical opponents is Arthur Schopenhauer, whom Nietzsche identifies with the Buddha. He has good reason to do so since Schopenhauer was much enamored with Eastern philosophy, particularly Buddhism. Schopenhauer also respected Plato and Emmanuel Kant. He followed Kant&rsquo;s lead in saying there was a noumenal (immaterial) world behind the phenomenal world, breaking with Kant to say the noumenal world was not something peaceful or benign but rather quite ominous—a relentless force he named &ldquo;will.&rdquo; This will always wants &ldquo;more,&rdquo; in Schopenhauer&rsquo;s view, and requires either procreation or destruction. Moreover, the &ldquo;objective&rdquo; world (world perceived by the senses) is a manifestation of this will. It is easy to see how Schopenhauer became pessimistic in the face of his own philosophy, which is centered on the idea that life is continually shaped by a perverse, irrational force. Human beings are held in thrall by this meaningless will, and the only thing they can do in the face of their predicament is to minimize their desires and cultivate asceticism.</p><p>Schopenhauer&rsquo;s philosophy has some correspondence with Buddhist ideas—for example the idea that life is suffering and it is possible to end suffering through the practice of detachment—and the philosopher noted these correspondences himself. But he was initially influenced by the Upanishads of Hinduism in writing his most important work, <em>The World as Will and Representation.</em> The Upanishads are Indian texts on which Hindu Vedanta philosophy is partially based. Buddhism is based on earlier ideas found in Hinduism. Although Schopenhauer became more identified with Buddhism than Hindu Vedanta, he actually read the Vedanta first and the Buddhist texts later. Nonetheless, by Nietzsche&rsquo;s time Schopenhauer was more identified with Buddhism, so Nietzsche specifically attacks this religion.</p><p>Nietzsche began his philosophical life as a disciple of Schopenhauer and was particularly drawn to his concept of will, although he later repudiated this philosophy. Nietzsche came to dislike Schopenhauer&rsquo;s pessimistic attitude that life was a burden to be carried. Nor did he like the idea that the best approach to living was to minimize the influence of the inexorable will by withdrawing as much as possible from the phenomenal world. Thus, Nietzsche turns Schopenhauer&rsquo;s philosophy on its head. He exhorts the reader to embrace life in its totality. In Section 56 he introduces another of his key ideas, &ldquo;eternal recurrence,&rdquo; which in other parts of his body of work appears to become a metaphysical belief (although many Nietzsche scholars doubt he believed in such a doctrine). In <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> Nietzsche proposes that a true world-affirmer loves life so much that he wants everything that he ever experienced repeated into eternity—because &ldquo;he needs himself—and makes himself necessary.&rdquo; In this statement, Nietzsche prefigures the existential idea that existence precedes essence—or to put it more simply, people determine who and what they are, and they create their life&rsquo;s meaning and their own necessity. To wish for eternal recurrence, as Nietzsche does in <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em>, is to unconditionally affirm life as it appears and life as it is lived—which is in direct opposition to Schopenhauerian philosophy.</p><p>Nietzsche repudiates Christianity for the same reasons he rejects Schopenhauer and all his works—including his affinity to Eastern philosophy. In Nietzsche&rsquo;s view the Christian faith begins with &ldquo;god on a cross,&rdquo; an image of the torture and humiliation of a god-man, which becomes the basis for a religion that elevates martyrdom. In common with Schopenhauer and Eastern philosophy is the Christian view that life in the phenomenal world is unsatisfying and corrupting and that it ought to be rejected in some fashion. While the Greeks were grateful for life, the Christians look forward to a life in the hereafter. Nietzsche praises the Old Testament of the Jews over the New Testament of the Christians because it is more in keeping with what he considers to be classical values in its stories of noble heroes who exert their will to power.</p><p>Christianity embraces people at their worst or in their most dejected state, partially as an echo of the worship of Christ on the cross. Nietzsche references the increasing &ldquo;cruelty&rdquo; of religion, in which more and more must be sacrificed—ultimately even God, in a final act of nihilism. For Christians the cross may be an emblem of compassion, but for Nietzsche it is a symbol of inverted values in which noble human traits such as strength, pride, and the desire to conquer are replaced by humility, weakness, and insecurity. God himself is sacrificed so that human beings may enter a metaphysical heaven, conceived as much superior to earthly life. In that sense, the Crucifixion can be seen as the ultimate rejection of the phenomenal world.</p><p>On the whole, the atheistic Nietzsche finds value in religion. While he sarcastically berates shallow bourgeois scholars who can hardly take religion seriously but are happy to live on the surface of life, he gives religion credit for making life bearable for those who more clearly see their predicament. That is, they consciously admit they are fated to suffer and die and seek relief in a religious solution. This is the &ldquo;truth&rdquo; he is referring to when he says that piety is the offspring of fear. Religion provides the promise of immortality and a meaning and purpose for living. Religion can also be the inspiration for great art. When it is used as a tool to elevate individuals or the species, Nietzsche doesn&rsquo;t mind religion. But in his view religion in the West in the form of Christianity has become a sovereign philosophy used to recreate the masses as herd animals. In Europe the religious view keeps people fearful and in their place, but worst of all, it teaches them to hate life and to hold in high esteem the worst traits of human beings, even while they destroy all that is good and noble in themselves.</p><hr><a href=#part-4--epigrams-and-interludes--summary><h1 id=part-4--epigrams-and-interludes--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 4 : Epigrams and Interludes | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-6><h2 id=summary-6><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/part-4-summary/ rel=noopener>Part 4</a> of <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> is a series of 125 aphorisms, or concise statements or observations, on a variety of subjects. While various critics have found connections among some groups of aphorisms and others have attempted to discern a pattern, the aphorisms are not actually organized in any consistent or discernible scheme. According to 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/author/ rel=noopener>Nietzsche</a> scholar Laurence Lampert, 100 of the maxims were taken from one notebook and written in the summer or fall of 1882, when Nietzsche had not even begun <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em>. The aphorisms appear to be an interlude between the two major divisions of the work, says Lampert: Parts 1 through 3 on philosophy and religion, and parts 5 through 9 on morality and politics.</p><p>The aphorism, a device frequently used by Nietzsche, is a seed thought from which many ideas can grow—in the mind of both the reader and the writer. Another metaphor that might be useful in understanding the purpose of the aphorisms is that they are mental &ldquo;search engines&rdquo; that can pull up several trains of thought, which the reader and the writer can synthesize to create a more sustained analysis. The aphorisms, for the most part, stay on the subject matter of the overall text and often startle the reader into thinking about a belief or idea in a new way. Many of these short, pithy maxims are intellectually dazzling and showcase the range and depth of Nietzsche&rsquo;s thinking. Some examples follow.</p><p>On love:</p><ul><li>&ldquo;Love of <em>one</em> is a barbarism; for it is exercised at the expense of all others. The love of God, too.&rdquo; Section 67</li><li>&ldquo;Whatever is done from love always occurs beyond good and evil.&rdquo; Section 153</li></ul><p>On the unconscious mind:</p><ul><li>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have done that,&rsquo; says my memory. &lsquo;I cannot have done that,&rsquo; says my pride, and remains inexorable. Eventually—memory yields.&rdquo; Section 68</li><li>&ldquo;When we are awake we also do what we do in our dreams: we invent and make up the person with whom we associate—and immediately forget it.&rdquo; Section 138</li></ul><p>On the will to power:</p><ul><li>&ldquo;Under peaceful conditions a warlike man sets upon himself.&rdquo; Section 76</li></ul><p>On morality:</p><ul><li>&ldquo;There are no moral phenomena at all, but only a moral interpretation of phenomena.&rdquo; Section 108</li><li>&ldquo;What a man <em>is</em> begins to betray itself when his talent decreases—when he stops showing what he <em>can do</em>. Talent, too, is finery; finery, too, is a hiding place.&rdquo; Section 130</li><li>&ldquo;To our strongest drive, the tyrant in us, not only our reason bows but also our conscience.&rdquo; Section 158</li></ul><p>Nietzsche also included some sexist and misogynistic aphorisms. Perhaps he is at times lampooning stereotypes and traditional views. At other times, he may be getting even with the women who disappointed, hurt, or annoyed him. Here are a few examples of such maxims:</p><ul><li>&ldquo;When a woman has scholarly inclinations there is usually something wrong with her sexually. Sterility itself disposes one toward a certain masculinity of taste; for man is, if I may say so, &rsquo;the sterile animal.&rsquo;&rdquo; Section 144</li><li>&ldquo;Comparing man and woman on the whole, one may say: woman would not have the genius for finery if she did not have an instinct for a <em>secondary</em> role.&rdquo; Section 145</li></ul><a href=#analysis-4><h2 id=analysis-4><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p>Section 67 calls love a barbarism, an idea that upends conventional thinking on the subject. Barbarism is the absence of refinement or the collapse of civilization. A barbarism can also be an extremely cruel act. 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/author/ rel=noopener>Nietzsche</a> could intend any number of meanings by his assertion: love grants undue entitlement to one person or entity while neglecting others and that exclusion is barbaric. Or exclusive love is a distortion of reality so great as to be barbaric. Or it is barbaric to cut off other avenues of possibility, even if this is a necessity of love. Finally, devoting oneself to God cuts off the possibility of other types of love. Section 153, the next aphorism on love, makes an interesting juxtaposition with Section 67, putting the act of love beyond conventional morality and in that sense negating Section 67 altogether.</p><p>Section 68 on the unconscious mind pierces the reader to the core, succinctly describing the necessary hypocrisy of the defense mechanism of repression. This behavior would be so named by Sigmund Freud after Nietzsche died. A person&rsquo;s self-image requires they deny anything they are ashamed of that does not live up to their notions about themselves. Thus, when people do something &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; in their own estimation, they either forget it, justify it, or turn it into something else to let themselves off the hook. Section 138 describes another classical psychological defense mechanism later named by Freud—projection. People project their own thoughts, values, and ideas onto other people, sometimes because they can&rsquo;t face up to them or sometimes because they need to have them embodied in someone else to see or experience them. Thus, from one perspective, all human interaction involves a series of projections.</p><p>In Section 76 Nietzsche describes the process of turning the will to power on oneself in an effort of self-overcoming. A warlike man will fight external enemies, but with no adversaries will become his own enemy. If the warrior fights simply out of perversity or hatred, that person will destroy themselves. However, if the warrior extends the will to power in a purposeful way, then an internal battle has the potential to raise that person to the level of an &ldquo;overman&rdquo;: Nietzsche&rsquo;s term for a human being who has gone beyond good and evil and has become part of higher humanity.</p><p>Section 108 clearly encapsulates one of Nietzsche&rsquo;s main ideas in <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em>—that there is no objective morality as a metaphysical given; rather there are only interpretations of acts or other phenomena according to an invented moral or conceptual scheme. Section 130 insightfully shows how every activity a human being engages in is a mask. Talent, for example, is a hiding place. On the surface, Nietzsche seems to be saying that the true measure of a man can be taken when all the masks are stripped off. But if the reader thinks more deeply about the aphorism, it will become apparent that—when everything is stripped away—a man is left with nothing. Thus, human beings are constructed personas. What appears to be an aphorism about morality is actually a maxim about the illusory nature of selfhood.</p><p>Finally, Section 158 brings several ideas together. The tyrant within a human being—the strongest drive—can be something &ldquo;negative,&rdquo; such as a drug addiction, or something &ldquo;positive,&rdquo; such as the desire to penetrate the nature of existence. Nietzsche says people have no control over that tyrant, which undermines the notion of free will. While Nietzsche did not put much stock in free will, he did believe in a will to power, an irresistible human drive to thrive, expand, and conquer, expressed weakly in some and much stronger than others.</p><p>Nietzsche&rsquo;s aphorisms on women are at times almost comical, as are these two. While he is clearly insulting the intellectual woman in Section 144, he is also insulting men in general, whom he calls sterile. The same man who wrote this aphorism also fell madly in love—and had his heart broken—by a brilliant intellectual woman whom he thought could become his disciple and carry on in his philosophical line. Section 145 pairs a taste for finery (something likely acquired) to an instinctive <em>secondary</em> role and draws an illogical conclusion—using logical fallacies such as hasty generalization, <em>post hoc ergo propter hoc</em> (a conclusion that assumes that if A happened after B then B must have caused A), and the genetic fallacy (an assumption that a person&rsquo;s sex determines character). It is hard to believe that someone as brilliant as Nietzsche could seriously believe such a statement. Moreover, Nietzsche&rsquo;s entire philosophy undermines the idea that truth or reality can be pinned down with certainty, and he would have applied that philosophy to himself.</p><hr><a href=#part-5--natural-history-of-morals--summary><h1 id=part-5--natural-history-of-morals--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 5 : Natural History of Morals | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-7><h2 id=summary-7><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p>Until now philosophers have foolishly insisted on supplying &ldquo;a <em>rational foundation</em> for morality&rdquo; instead of attempting to describe types of moral behavior. Moreover, they tend to limit their moral investigations to their own experience and environment rather than compare moralities. Also missing from their questionable &ldquo;&lsquo;science of morals&rsquo;&rdquo; is &ldquo;the problem of morality itself.&rdquo; 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/author/ rel=noopener>Nietzsche</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;&lsquo;rational foundation&rsquo;&rdquo; has been nothing more than the scholar&rsquo;s &ldquo;common <em>faith</em> in the prevalent morality&rdquo; and denial that it was at all problematic. This is the very opposite of a true analysis and a &ldquo;vivisection&rdquo; of their faith.</p><p>The philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer once again takes a drubbing, as Nietzsche scoffs at his idea that all moral philosophers agree on the &ldquo;fundamental proposition&rdquo; to &ldquo;hurt no one; rather, help all as much as you can.&rdquo; Neither Schopenhauer nor anyone else was able to put a rational foundation underneath this principle. Nietzsche calls the principle itself &ldquo;insipidly false and sentimental &mldr; in a world whose essence is will to power.&rdquo; He also criticizes philosopher Emmanuel Kant&rsquo;s categorical imperative, which claims that there is are certain unconditional moral obligations that never vary, regardless of time or place. Such pronouncements say more about the moral prejudices of philosophers than anything else, as Nietzsche pointed out in 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/part-1-summary/ rel=noopener>Part 1</a>.</p><p>According to Nietzsche in Section 188, &ldquo;every morality is &mldr; a bit of tyranny against &rsquo;nature&rsquo;; also against &lsquo;reason.&rsquo;&rdquo; Nonetheless, &ldquo;the curious fact&rdquo; is that all &ldquo;on earth of freedom, subtlety, boldness, dance, and masterly sureness,&rdquo; whether in government, rhetoric, the arts, or in ethics has developed &ldquo;only owing to the &rsquo;tyranny of &mldr; capricious laws.&rsquo;&rdquo; What Nietzsche means is that civilization as we know it is based on several layers of laws, and these laws may, at times, seem arbitrary to an individual who is obliged to follow the law. Moreover, such tyranny is probably more &ldquo;natural&rdquo; than &ldquo;<em>laisser aller</em>&rdquo; (letting go). For example, an artist obeys a thousand laws in the process of creating a work of art. Specifically, they might use three-point perspective to create the illusion of three dimensions on a two-dimensional surface or use shading to create a dramatic effect in a drawing or painting. According to Nietzsche, &ldquo;obedience over a long period of time and in a single direction&rdquo; is necessary to develop something that makes life worth living—&ldquo;virtue, art, music, dance, reason, spirituality—something transfiguring, subtle, mad, and divine.&rdquo; Even if this &ldquo;unfreedom of the spirit&rdquo; is at times gruesome or anti-rational, it has been the means by &ldquo;which the European spirit has been trained to strength, ruthless curiosity, and subtle mobility,&rdquo; even if that spirit has also been partially stifled and crushed. Nietzsche says that slavery in all its forms is &ldquo;the indispensable means of spiritual discipline and cultivation, too.&rdquo; Morality instills the idea that people need &ldquo;limited horizons&rdquo; and a &ldquo;<em>narrowing of our perspective</em>, and &mldr; in a certain sense stupidity, as a condition of life and growth.&rdquo; To replace Kant&rsquo;s categorical imperative, Nietzsche proposes nature&rsquo;s moral imperative—to obey someone for a long time.</p><p>Nietzsche spends a few sections on side roads to his main argument that morality is a way to control people and then returns to it in Section 198, noting that all moralities address individual happiness and offer counsel in protecting oneself against one&rsquo;s own &ldquo;dangerousness.&rdquo; Moralities are &ldquo;recipes against [man&rsquo;s] passions, his good or bad inclinations insofar as they have the will to power and want to play the master.&rdquo; All moralities generalize all people when they should rather take themselves as &ldquo;unconditional.&rdquo; Nietzsche says that for the entire history of humanity, there have been herds of people—clans, states, churches, etc.—representing the majority but commanded by the minority. Thus, it can be assumed that most people have an innate need to obey, having developed a sort of &ldquo;<em>formal conscience</em>&rdquo; telling them to do so. This conscience somewhat arbitrarily &ldquo;seizes upon things &mldr; shouted into its ears by someone who issues commands.&rdquo; Nietzsche claims that the herd instinct has so taken hold of humanity that even the commanders must find a justification for their right of precedence, citing such reasons as God or ancestors, or even that they are the servants of the people. Meanwhile, herd men wallow in their tameness. The herd extols the virtues of benevolence, consideration, moderation, pity, and the like. Sometimes the herd tries to use &ldquo;clever herd men&rdquo; to replace &ldquo;commanders,&rdquo; and this results in such phenomena as &ldquo;parliamentary constitutions.&rdquo; Nonetheless, herd man is relieved when someone who &ldquo;commands unconditionally&rdquo; arises, as was seen when Napoleon Bonaparte made his appearance in Europe in the beginning of the 18th century.</p><p>So long as the good of the herd is the first consideration of moral judgments, &ldquo;there can be no more morality of &rsquo;neighbor love,&rsquo;&rdquo; Nietzsche says in Section 201. The love of one&rsquo;s neighbor in any society must go hand-in-hand with the fear of one&rsquo;s neighbor, which creates new moral valuations. What Nietzsche means is that in a democratically minded society or herd, the individual is always a threat to other individuals unless every individual agrees to abide by the rules that have been established by the herd. Traits such as daring, enterprise, and shrewdness, previously cultivated to protect the community against its enemies, become immoral, since these traits are uncommon and can be used against other herd members. Now opposite drives are cultivated that cannot pose a danger to the community, since fear becomes &ldquo;the mother of morals&rdquo; and the most highly valued trait. Traits such as &ldquo;independent spirituality&rdquo; or &ldquo;the will to stand alone&rdquo; put a person above the herd and thus intimidate the herd (and can pose a threat). Not surprisingly, according to Nietzsche these qualities become &ldquo;evil&rdquo; qualities. Meanwhile, mediocrity, in the form of submissive, conforming behavior, is honored.</p><p>In Section 202 Nietzsche says Europe&rsquo;s morality is herd animal morality, one morality among many. This morality could be succeeded by higher moralities, although the current morality recognizes none but itself. In Nietzsche&rsquo;s view &ldquo;the democratic movement is the heir of the Christian movement,&rdquo; which promulgates the herd morality. Nietzsche classifies the anarchists and socialists as part of the herd, noting that &ldquo;once all are equal nobody needs &lsquo;rights&rsquo; anymore.&rdquo; All three—democrats, anarchists, and socialists—share the &ldquo;religion of pity&rdquo; and threaten Europe with &ldquo;a new Buddhism.&rdquo; They have faith &ldquo;in the community as the savior,&rdquo; which means they have faith in the herd.</p><p>The last section, 203, is a call to &ldquo;new philosophers.&rdquo; Nietzsche calls to them to stimulate opposite values and teach people that the future of mankind depends on human will. The &ldquo;dominion of nonsense and accident that so far has been called &lsquo;history&rsquo;&rdquo; must be put aside. More specifically, Nietzsche wants to throw down herd morality and see free spirits come forward who will cultivate leaders who can take humanity to a higher level—they will create the conditions for the higher man to emerge. His focus is not on any solution, but on the problem he sees as the basis for what he despises in society. Nietzsche&rsquo;s art is in destroying, not creating.</p><a href=#analysis-5><h2 id=analysis-5><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p>In this chapter on the natural history of morals, 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/author/ rel=noopener>Nietzsche</a> picks apart a number of related threads as he parses the evolution of morality. He will revisit this evolution in more depth in <em>The Genealogy of Morals</em> (1887), but his first outline of the subject appears here. It is important for the reader to remember that Nietzsche is not making value judgments in a conventional way—after all, the title of this book is <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em>. Rather, he is interpreting the facts as he sees them; it helps if readers remind themselves of that so that they can more clearly consider whether they agree with what he is saying.</p><p>This section explicates Nietzsche&rsquo;s ideas about herd morality, which evolved from Christian morality. He will discuss the noble man (person) in the last part of <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em>—who, for him, is much preferable to the herd man. Nietzsche uses a kind of shorthand for what he sees as master and slave morality. The original masters in Europe were the Roman aristocrats who had full scope to exercise their will to power. The slaves were the oppressed and persecuted Christians. They expressed their _ressentiment—_a psychological state of suppressed hatred and envy—against their masters by imagining they would be rewarded in the afterlife for their virtue while their masters would be punished. The Christian <em>ressentiment</em> also expresses itself as apparent love and charity for one&rsquo;s oppressor, an expression of bad faith (hypocrisy). Eventually, the slave morality won over the master morality as all of Europe became Christianized. These are ideas that can be found in other works by Nietzsche and can help the reader as background to understand this part.</p><p>Nietzsche begins 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/part-5-summary/ rel=noopener>Part 5</a> by debunking the notion that there can be a rational foundation for morality. The philosophers before him wished to find rational reasons for why people have determined some behaviors are good and others are bad. In general, human beings feel intuitively that people have innate or intuitive knowledge of morality, which Nietzsche did not believe. In more recent times, scientists have found that both aggressive and cooperative behavior is innate in primates, including humans, and that even other species (such as dogs) have an innate sense of fairness. While &ldquo;proto-morality&rdquo; or some basic sense of right and wrong may be innate, Nietzsche is not wrong to think morality is relative, given the range of behaviors that have been deemed acceptable by human societies. With the advent of science in the West, philosophers had sought to provide a &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; underpinning for moral aspects of their philosophies that were essentially religious ideas. This is why Kant discovers the &ldquo;categorical imperative,&rdquo; which provides a rational reason for the Christian idea to not harm others. But in Nietzsche&rsquo;s view this is no more than a prejudice.</p><p>He moves on to say that every morality is a tyranny against nature because it imposes rules on people&rsquo;s natural inclinations. At the same time, he fully acknowledges the importance of morality. Without &ldquo;capricious laws&rdquo; there would be no possibility of freedom or mastery because people who live together must necessarily be governed by rules; without them society would fall into chaos and destruction. Even on a micro-level, tyranny is necessary—and Nietzsche makes a subtle switch away from moral law to the imposition of rules and structure in his example of what artists do. Artists must obey laws, and in fact people in civilizations learn the habit of obedience, which allows for the creation of everything worthwhile about human culture—including the traits he later ascribes to the noble man. On the other hand, a habit of obedience crushes the spirit. At the end of this part of his discussion, Nietzsche turns Kant on his head, opining that his &ldquo;categorical imperative&rdquo; should be replaced with a &ldquo;moral imperative,&rdquo; which is an inclination for slavery created by the habit of obedience.</p><p>Moralities—Nietzsche acknowledges that there is more than one kind—are also useful to rein in people&rsquo;s passions, which are exhibitions of will to power and are often dangerous to themselves. For example, some people have a passion for food that, if left unchecked, can kill them. Nietzsche sees morality as useful, although he objects to the fact that one system of morality is imposed on everybody as unconditional. This unconditional morality can also be called &ldquo;herd morality,&rdquo; and Nietzsche says people&rsquo;s desire to be led and to follow the herd is so strong—having been strengthened by the habit of obedience—that even leaders feel guilty about leading. He posits that a herd must always have commanders, but the &ldquo;herd instinct&rdquo; is even in them, which is why they have to come up with excuses for why they have chosen or have been chosen to lead. In Nietzsche&rsquo;s view, they should need no justification if they are above the herd in some way. He also says that the democratic instinct is a herd instinct, since it is society&rsquo;s way of attempting to get around the necessity of commanders. Nonetheless, the herd mentality necessitates a strong leader, which is why people feel relief when man of action steps forward—such as a Napoleon—and takes charge of them.</p><p>Within herd morality the herd elevates the virtues of kindness, compassion, moderation. Such virtues render people harmless so they cannot hurt others, Nietzsche argues, and preserves society or the herd. In fact, such morality does not promote the Christian idea of loving one&rsquo;s neighbor because the herd morality is actually based on fear of the other—fear of the damage they can do. There is a paradox here: on the one hand herd mentality protects individuals, but on the other, its purpose is to protect the herd. Nietzsche points out a second paradox, which is that the virtues suppressed by the herd—such as foolhardiness (daring or risk-taking), enterprising spirit (initiative and creativity), and craftiness (the ability to strategize and predict)—are the very traits that are needed to protect a society from outside enemies. Thus, herd morality also poses a danger to the herd by suppressing people&rsquo;s anti-social instincts. On the whole, herd morality and a herd mentality promotes mediocrity and conformity and contains the seeds for the ultimate destruction of the herd. In Nietzsche&rsquo;s view herd morality is the product of Christianity—the religion of pity—which he also equates with a &ldquo;new Buddhism&rdquo;—i.e., Schopenhauerian philosophy. He calls for philosophers and free spirits to stimulate opposite values—the cultivation of master morality and the noble man—which is necessary for moving humanity to a higher level, in his view.</p><hr><a href=#part-6--we-scholars--summary><h1 id=part-6--we-scholars--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 6 : We Scholars | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-8><h2 id=summary-8><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p>In

<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/author/ rel=noopener>Nietzsche</a> turns his laser-like intellect on scholars, whom he equates with those who practice science, but it is important for a modern reader to understand, according to translator Walter Kaufmann, that the German term <em>wissenschaft</em> also has the meaning of scholarship and does not primarily refer to the natural sciences as understood in current English usage. Thus, Nietzsche&rsquo;s scholars are more akin to academics and critics who have the temerity to attempt &ldquo;to lay down laws for philosophy.&rdquo; Nietzsche allows that some of recent scholars&rsquo; disgust with philosophy is because of recent bad philosophy, and he again faults Schopenhauer for &ldquo;wrenching the whole last generation of Germans out of the context of German culture&rdquo; and opening &ldquo;the gates to the instinct of the rabble.&rdquo; Philosophy that has been reduced to &ldquo;theory of knowledge&rdquo; is no philosophy at all, in Nietzsche&rsquo;s view.</p><p>Unlike the scholar, a true philosopher lives &ldquo;&lsquo;unphilosophically&rsquo; and &lsquo;unwisely,&rsquo; above all <em>imprudently</em>.&rdquo; While genius &ldquo;<em>begets</em> or <em>gives birth</em>,&rdquo; a scholar is like an old maid—remaining respectable but barren. The &ldquo;scientific man&rdquo; (scholar or critic) is not &ldquo;noble&rdquo;—neither dominant and authoritative, nor self-sufficient. He works hard and is patient, accepting his place in life. He honors the needs of his peers for recognition and a good name, which offsets the &ldquo;<em>mistrust</em> which is the sediment in the hearts of all dependent men and herd animals.&rdquo; Scholars are also envious, however, of their betters, which is why they &ldquo;instinctively [work] at the annihilation of the uncommon man.&rdquo;</p><p>Nietzsche writes that the objective person (&ldquo;the <em>ideal</em> scholar&rdquo;) is an instrument, not an end in themselves. Such people are mirrors that reflect &ldquo;whatever wants to be known.&rdquo; They are passageways who remember themselves &ldquo;only with an effort and often mistakenly.&rdquo; Nietzsche claims that scholars avoid taking a definitive stand on a subject, proving themselves &ldquo;inauthentic, fragile, questionable, and worm-eaten.&rdquo; The scholar is a &ldquo;sublime type of slave,&rdquo; but a slave nevertheless. When a philosopher disavows skepticism, they are criticized because skepticism is the &ldquo;soporific and sedative&rdquo; of scholars and their ilk. The skeptic is &ldquo;a delicate creature &mldr; frightened all too easily; his conscience is trained to quiver at every No, indeed even at a Yes that is decisive and hard.&rdquo; The skeptic is afraid to claim knowledge or to take a stand, an indication of &ldquo;paralysis of the will.&rdquo; According to Nietzsche, the philosophers of the future will not be skeptics, in this weak-willed sense. Rather, they will be able to say <em>No</em> and take things apart, know how to &ldquo;handle a knife,&rdquo; and say that &ldquo;critics are the instruments of the philosopher.&rdquo;</p><p>In Section 211 Nietzsche insists emphatically that people should stop confusing philosophers with philosophical laborers (i.e., scientifically minded scholars and critics as well as philosophers that Nietzsche does not respect as the genuine article). At one time a philosopher may have been a scholar—as was the case for Nietzsche. But his work in that realm was merely a &ldquo;precondition&rdquo; for his task as a philosopher—wholly different—which is the creation of values. Philosophical laborers create formulas within a discipline, which &ldquo;are for a time called &rsquo;truths.&rsquo;&rdquo; According to Nietzsche, their job is to synthesize previous knowledge and make it intelligible and in so doing &ldquo;to <em>overcome</em> the entire past.&rdquo;</p><p>Nietzsche says that &ldquo;genuine philosophers, however, are commanders and legislators.&rdquo; They use the work of the philosophical laborers to look toward the future: &ldquo;Their &lsquo;knowing&rsquo; is <em>creating</em>, their creating is a legislation, their will to truth is—<em>will to power</em>.&rdquo; Such a philosopher will always find themselves in contradiction with the thinking of their own time period, Nietzsche says in Section 212. In their own time, they are &ldquo;disagreeable fools and dangerous question marks&rdquo;; their task is to be the &ldquo;bad conscience&rdquo; of their era. They expose the hypocrisy of contemporary morality and reveal &ldquo;a <em>new</em> greatness of man.&rdquo; Philosophers are &ldquo;compelled to find the greatness of man &mldr; precisely in his range and multiplicity, in his wholeness in manifoldness.&rdquo; They measure a person according to how much they can take on themselves, how far they can &ldquo;extend &mldr; [their] responsibility.&rdquo; For Nietzsche, the philosopher holds an ideal of &ldquo;strength of the will&rdquo; and the ability of the &ldquo;higher man&rdquo; to stand alone against the herd. Such a human being is &ldquo;beyond good and evil, the master of his virtues, he that is overrich in will.&rdquo;</p><a href=#analysis-6><h2 id=analysis-6><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p>In

<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/author/ rel=noopener>Nietzsche</a> discourses on the differences between philosophers and scholars and faults the latter for attempting to reduce philosophy to a mere theory of knowledge (epistemology). He scolds these philosophical laborers for trying to tell philosophers how to do their business and once again blames Arthur Schopenhauer, this time for people&rsquo;s losing faith in philosophy. In Nietzsche&rsquo;s view Schopenhauer further imbued philosophy with nihilistic, life-denying values akin to Buddhism when it was already suffering from the nihilistic influences of Christianity.</p><p>Nietzsche points out several differences between scholars and &ldquo;philosophical laborers&rdquo; and philosophers. First, the scholars are part of the herd and practice slave morality, even if they are a &ldquo;sublime type of slave.&rdquo; By this he means that they ascribe to slave/Christian values such as patience, hard work, and respect for authority. Nonetheless, they are also hypocritical practitioners of <em>ressentiment</em> (suppressed hatred and envy), which is why they would like to smash the &ldquo;uncommon man.&rdquo; These scholars are skeptics in the worse sense of the term, being too cowardly to take a stand on anything. When pushed to the wall, they hypocritically quote Socrates: &ldquo;I know that I know nothing.&rdquo; For Nietzsche, they are unoriginal, and the best of them (and here Nietzsche mentions &ldquo;real&rdquo; philosophers like Kant and Hegel)—philosophical laborers—simply &ldquo;<em>overcome</em>&rdquo; the past (i.e., exercise some degree of will to power) by organizing and synthesizing ideas. On the other hand, the real philosophers create new ways of thinking and being in the world—these are &ldquo;<em>commanders</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>legislators</em>.&rdquo; The translator Walter Kaufmann notes that Nietzsche&rsquo;s appraisal of these so-called philosophical laborers (like Kant and Hegel), as compared to the philosophers (like Nietzsche and the people he imagines following him), is &ldquo;highly questionable,&rdquo; defending Nietzsche&rsquo;s colleagues in the philosophical canon.</p><p>Nietzsche&rsquo;s use of the word <em>wissenschaft</em>, which can be translated as either science or scholarship (as explained by Kaufmann) is important to take into consideration when reading this part on scholars. Nietzsche rails against the scholars who belong to the herd, in the service of raising up the new philosopher—whom he equates with the higher man or &ldquo;overman&rdquo;—a term he has used in other works. That is his primary purpose here. But he anticipates the future, to some degree, in his objection that non-scientific thinkers ought not to appropriate the language of science to justify their positions. For example, current practitioners of the social sciences—particularly psychology—attempt to equate their disciplines with the hard sciences. But theories in the social sciences are mostly unprovable, while scientific theories are continually proved, revised, and changed as new evidence comes to light. Moreover, science actually produces a tangible product—technology. Nietzsche believed religion was losing its authority and that science would become the new &ldquo;religion.&rdquo; Not surprisingly, the scholars he describes are trying to move philosophy toward the scientific paradigm.</p><p>But Nietzsche has full faith in philosophy and wants to rehabilitate it and wrest it away from religious ideas—which it has imbibed since the advent of Christianity. He believes new philosophers, no longer married to the old paradigms, have the ability to put humanity on a new track and bring to birth the &ldquo;higher man.&rdquo; These genuine philosophers will create new values, as opposed to the scholars who can only rework what has already been said. According to the <em>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</em>, Nietzsche&rsquo;s ideas about these new values are much less clear than his critique of the old values. However, critics may be looking at Nietzsche through the wrong lens. According to Robert Wicks, the author of the <em>Stanford Encyclopedia</em>&rsquo;s entry on Nietzsche, his unsystematic philosophy makes it hard to discern a programmatic approach to values. He does make some specific claims, even if he himself was less concerned with creating &ldquo;&lsquo;positive ethics&rsquo; to accommodate certain &lsquo;moral intuitions.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><hr><a href=#part-7--our-virtues--summary><h1 id=part-7--our-virtues--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 7 : Our Virtues | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-9><h2 id=summary-9><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/part-7-summary/ rel=noopener>Part 7</a> seeks to enumerate the virtues of the new philosopher—&ldquo;We Europeans of the day after tomorrow.&rdquo; 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/author/ rel=noopener>Nietzsche</a> asks somewhat ironically whether there is &ldquo;anything more beautiful than looking for one&rsquo;s own virtues.&rdquo; To look for one&rsquo;s virtue presupposes &ldquo;believing in one&rsquo;s own virtue.&rdquo; This puts the new philosopher in the same boat with their grandfathers, he says, wearing &ldquo;the venerable long pigtail&rdquo; of &ldquo;&lsquo;good conscience.&rsquo;&rdquo; With this beginning Nietzsche seems to be warning the reader that he already has suspicions about these virtues.</p><p>Philosophies that &ldquo;measure the value of things in accordance with <em>pleasure</em> and <em>pain</em>&rdquo; are naïve, and anyone with an &ldquo;artistic conscience&rdquo; will scorn and even pity those who hold this viewpoint—but not with the pity of the rabble. Rather, this &ldquo;higher and more farsighted pity&rdquo; is how human beings diminish themselves. According to Nietzsche, to want to &ldquo;<em>abolish suffering</em>&rdquo; is &ldquo;insane.&rdquo;; the new philosopher would rather heighten suffering. &ldquo;Well-being&rdquo; is not a noble goal but rather an end to human dignity—wellbeing &ldquo;makes man ridiculous and contemptible.&rdquo; According to Nietzsche all &ldquo;enhancements to man&rdquo; created so far have been wrought by &ldquo;the discipline of suffering, of <em>great</em> suffering.&rdquo; Through suffering the soul gathers strength along with &ldquo;inventiveness,&rdquo; &ldquo;courage,&rdquo; and &ldquo;perseverance,&rdquo; among other virtues. Nietzsche says that in great suffering, &ldquo;<em>creature</em> and <em>creator</em> are united,&rdquo; and people may fashion themselves.</p><p>Honesty is a virtue from which &ldquo;free spirits&rdquo; cannot escape, says Nietzsche. Therefore, he recommends that true philosophers use their &ldquo;malice and love&rdquo; to perfect the only virtue left to them. Although others may call them immoral, they must &ldquo;remain hard&rdquo; and tell the truth about what they know. They will come to the assistance of their &ldquo;god&rdquo; (honesty) with the help of all their &ldquo;devils&rdquo;—curiosity, courage, and their &ldquo;most spiritual will to power and overcoming of the world.&rdquo;</p><p>For Nietzsche, morality can be &ldquo;dangerous, captious, and seductive.&rdquo; For example, the British Utilitarian philosophers have allowed &ldquo;cant&rdquo; (hypocritical talk) to sneak into their philosophy, masquerading as science, and they are secretly fighting against a &ldquo;bad conscience.&rdquo; The Utilitarians, who began with Jeremy Bentham, created a system of ethics in which right action is what promotes the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. Nietzsche makes fun of these philosophers, saying they want to impose English happiness on everybody. The idea of &ldquo;the general welfare&rdquo; is not a &ldquo;remotely intelligible concept&rdquo; because &ldquo;what is fair for one <em>cannot</em> by any means for that reason alone also be fair for others.&rdquo; One-size-fits-all morality is &ldquo;detrimental for the higher men &mldr; there is an order of rank between man and man, hence also between morality and morality.&rdquo;</p><p>According to Nietzsche, such insipid philosophy as Utilitarianism is the product of fear of the return of the &ldquo;savage cruel beast&rdquo; who has been conquered in the modern era. Nietzsche is referring to the veneer of civilization that has done away with such barbarity as the blood sport of the Roman arena. European civilization protects the weak and promotes the Christian values of love and compassion for one&rsquo;s neighbor. But cruelty needs to be reconsidered, he opines. Almost all of what passes for &ldquo;&lsquo;higher culture&rsquo; is based on the spiritualization of <em>cruelty</em>,&rdquo; says Nietzsche. The &ldquo;painful voluptuousness of tragedy is cruelty.&rdquo; For example, he cites &ldquo;the Christian in the ecstasies of the cross,&rdquo; referencing the fact that Christians pray before the image of a crucified God whom they worship. Two other examples he uses are French nostalgia for the bloody revolutions that toppled the aristocracy and the joy that people feel when watching a Wagnerian operatic tragedy like <em>Tristan und Isolde</em>. Psychology thus far has not provided much insight about people&rsquo;s love of cruelty, Nietzsche says, other than it &ldquo;came into being at the sight of the sufferings of <em>others</em>.&rdquo;</p><p>But what is also enjoyable is one&rsquo;s own suffering—religious or ascetic self-denial or self-mutilation—for example. Moreover, Nietzsche says that the seeker of knowledge &ldquo;forces his spirit to recognize things against the inclination of the spirit, and often enough against the wishes of his heart,&rdquo; in an act of cruelty. This occurs when the seeker says No when he would rather say Yes, or when that person insists on &ldquo;profundity&rdquo; when &ldquo;the basic will of the spirit &mldr; unceasingly strives for the apparent and superficial.&rdquo; Nietzsche further explains that the basic will of the spirit wishes to be master of its own domain, appropriate and assimilate what is foreign, simplify what is complicated, ignore what is contradictory, and so forth, &ldquo;falsifying&rdquo; the world to suit itself. There is also the drive to close one&rsquo;s eyes and say <em>Yes</em> to ignorance, as well as a drive to deceive and conceal using a variety of masks. In summary, people naturally want to make life easier for themselves by reducing complexity and refusing to look at what contradicts their prejudices. To do so they sometimes have to cover up reality through a variety of deceptive strategies. But for the seeker of knowledge, these natural drives to make life easy or pleasant are &ldquo;countered&rdquo; by an insistence on &ldquo;profundity, multiplicity, and thoroughness &mldr; a kind of cruelty of the intellectual conscience.&rdquo; Nietzsche somewhat sarcastically says this might be called &ldquo;extravagant honesty.&rdquo; The free spirits can give other fancy names to this tendency—such as love of wisdom or love of truth—but Nietzsche calls these mere masks, under which the natural man must be recognized. Thus, he is pointing out that the true philosopher is less concerned with parading the virtue of honesty (as a mask) and more interested in seeing the ugly things that might be lurking underneath the mask.</p><p>Nietzsche now admits that although &ldquo;learning changes us&rdquo; there is something &ldquo;&lsquo;deep down&rsquo;&rdquo; that is &ldquo;unteachable&rdquo; and cannot change. At times a person finds certain solutions to problems that inspire them and afterward calls them &ldquo;convictions.&rdquo; Later they might realize they were only &ldquo;steps to self-knowledge,&rdquo; signposts pointing to the &ldquo;problem&rdquo; that is each individual person. Now that Nietzsche has so truthfully shared his heart with the reader, he asks permission to share &ldquo;a few truths about &lsquo;woman as such&rsquo;—assuming that it is now known at the outset how very much these are after all only—my truths.&rdquo;</p><p>The next eight sections consist of what might be called a sexist rant against the feminist movement, the archetype of the eternal feminine (&ldquo;woman as such&rdquo;), and women in general. Nietzsche makes misogynistic statements and repeats stereotypical beliefs about women. He opines that women should be treated as property, kept under control by men. He accuses women of being immodest, stupid, and even bad cooks in the kitchen. Was Nietzsche an unregenerate misogynist, or did he perhaps use his own ambivalent feelings about women to demonstrate to the reader that the honesty of the free spirit requires the dredging up of his own falsified perspective and the embrace of an uncomfortable but richer complexity?</p><a href=#analysis-7><h2 id=analysis-7><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/part-7-summary/ rel=noopener>Part 7</a> begins somewhat ironically, with 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/author/ rel=noopener>Nietzsche</a> informing the reader that he will now turn to the virtues of the new philosophers, sarcastically noting that looking at one&rsquo;s virtue presupposes believing in them. This is ironic and humorous because he has so far spent a lot of time ridiculing the so-called virtues of Europe&rsquo;s &ldquo;grandfathers,&rdquo; and here he is wearing the same &ldquo;pigtail&rdquo; of good conscience, meaning that he is patting himself on the back for being &ldquo;good&rdquo;—the very thing he abhors.</p><p>His main argument begins by first reminding the reader that most philosophy sees value in avoiding pain and maximizing pleasure, but this is a mistake, because wellbeing dooms people to living as herd animals, while suffering builds character. This idea at first seems counterintuitive. Everyone wants to be happy, and people know from experience that they are always chasing pleasure. Yet it is also true that this pursuit leaves them dissatisfied, which seems to indicate that the pleasures they find do not make them happy. In the Buddhist&rsquo;s view, life goes hand and hand with suffering, but a Buddhist practitioner sees no benefit in suffering. Rather, Buddhist practitioners strive to end their suffering through the practices of detachment from desire (consciously curtailing the pursuit of pleasure) and various forms of meditation to reach &ldquo;nirvana,&rdquo; a transcendent state beyond suffering. On the other hand, Nietzsche views suffering as a character-builder and as the means for the free spirit to create a self. While Nietzsche maintained a skeptical attitude about whether an individual has a self, he refers to people&rsquo;s souls and seems to indicate, despite his objections to similar ideas voiced by other philosophers, that the ego has the possibility of transcending—if not ordinary awareness, then at least ordinary limitations. To do so would necessitate a self. Or perhaps in his view, only those who suffer have the fortitude and courage to actually fashion a self.</p><p>In that sense Nietzsche is the first existentialist philosopher, beginning with the idea that existence precedes essence—or more simply, human beings are responsible for creating the meaning of their lives. In fact, what Nietzsche now makes clear in his extended discourse on morality is that the key virtue of free spirits—a.k.a. &ldquo;higher men&rdquo; (and women), <em>übermensch</em> (overmen or supermen, as described in <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em>, the text that precedes <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em>), and real philosophers—is honesty. As the <em>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</em> notes, no other virtue gets Nietzsche&rsquo;s &ldquo;unqualified praise&rdquo; throughout the body of his work. Honesty is the virtue of the few, the brave, and the strong, and as Nietzsche points out in <em>The Gay Science</em>, &ldquo;the great majority of people lacks an intellectual conscience.&rdquo; Nietzsche also raises again the specter of &ldquo;bad conscience&rdquo; in <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em>, or the guilt that arises as a by-product of Christian morality, which goes against a person&rsquo;s natural inclinations. Thus, he calls the Utilitarians hypocritical for trying to provide a scientific underpinning to justify their British morality.</p><p>As Nietzsche has already established, the will to power drives life and is behind people&rsquo;s natural desires and inclinations. Even true philosophers wish to experience mastery in the world in one or more fields of endeavor. They too seek to neutralize what is foreign to their way of thinking and would naturally want to ignore what contradicts their world view, even while &ldquo;falsifying&rdquo; the world by paying attention only to that which confirms what they already believe. This is the way the majority of people live—without an intellectual conscience. Thus, there is a cruelty in heeding one&rsquo;s intellectual conscience, which demands &ldquo;profundity, multiplicity, and thoroughness.&rdquo; The free spirit who makes a conscious decision to live by the demands of their intellectual conscience is deliberately embracing that cruelty—that self-laceration in the service of gaining knowledge. Elsewhere in his canon, Nietzsche will identify this quest for self-knowledge with <em>ressentiment</em> turned inward, against oneself, in the service of fashioning a higher self. Nietzsche identifies <em>ressentiment</em> as the suppressed slave&rsquo;s hatred or spite against their oppressors.</p><p>He goes on to explain that the intellectual conscience demands people examine their prejudices and insists that they look at other points of view. The intellectual conscience admits that, for all the learning a thinking person acquires in a lifetime, &ldquo;deep down&rdquo; there is a part of their nature remaining unwilling to change. Even the free spirit must have their convictions because without any convictions it is impossible to live. Thus, a true philosopher embraces their convictions, even while admitting that they offer only a partial view of reality and are merely signposts along the way, until they reach the next level of understanding.</p><p>It is no coincidence that after this brilliant discourse on intellectual conscience and the price the true philosopher pays for it, Nietzsche unleashes a tirade against the female of the species. There is no doubt that Nietzsche had mixed feelings about women and wrote disparaging comments about them in many of his works. Perhaps he felt oppressed—or at least outnumbered—as the only male growing up in a household of five females (his mother, grandmother, two aunts, and a sister). At one point Nietzsche joked about his theory of eternal recurrence, saying the only argument against it was his mother and his sister—meaning he couldn&rsquo;t tolerate the idea of their existence being repeated, again and again. His sister meddled in his affairs, and they became more estranged after Elisabeth Nietzsche embraced anti-Semitism. The unrequited love of Nietzsche&rsquo;s life was Lou Salomé, a brilliant young Russian who rejected him in 1882 and went on to pursue an intellectual career and friendships with powerful men, including Sigmund Freud, even becoming a psychoanalyst herself. Nietzsche had hoped Salomé would marry him and build on his philosophical ideas as his disciple. Nietzsche also had friendships with women throughout his life and, by their own accounts, always treated them with respect and kindness. At the same time, women in his life were not unaware of his anti-feminist views.</p><p>Nietzsche&rsquo;s feelings about women are complicated. He has his axe to grind, but it seems clear that the sections on women at the end of Part 7 are by way of demonstrating to the reader the part of his nature that has remained fixed. He does this in the interests of full disclosure and honesty to demonstrate his own bona fide membership in club of genuine philosophers, in a manner of speaking. In an article titled &ldquo;Nietzsche&rsquo;s Misogyny,&rdquo; Nietzschean scholar and feminist Maudemarie Clark argues that the misogyny in <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> is &ldquo;on the level of sentiment, not belief,&rdquo; and that Nietzsche uses it to &ldquo;illustrate points he is trying to make about philosophy and the will to truth.&rdquo; She further suggests that Nietzsche is challenging feminists to exhibit the virtue (honesty) he shows in exposing his misogyny. Nietzsche prefaces his statements about women with the caveat that he is expressing &ldquo;my truths,&rdquo; meaning his convictions—which by the tenets of his own philosophy are limited and one-sided.</p><hr><a href=#part-8--peoples-and-fatherlands--summary><h1 id=part-8--peoples-and-fatherlands--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 8 : Peoples and Fatherlands | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-10><h2 id=summary-10><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p>Chapter 8 is a discourse on the &ldquo;races&rdquo; of Europe—but what 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/author/ rel=noopener>Nietzsche</a> means by races is primarily what modern people would call ethnicities and nationalities. He begins with his old sparring partner—the operatic composer and pseudo-philosopher Richard Wagner, about whom Nietzsche has already said many negative things by the time he wrote <em>Beyond Good and Evil.</em> Nonetheless, he accords Wagner qualified praise and says his music &ldquo;expresses best&rdquo; what Nietzsche thinks about Germans: they belong to both the past and the future. After some preliminary statements about nationalism, which he calls &ldquo;fatherlandishness&rdquo; and &ldquo;soil addiction,&rdquo; he turns to the democratization of Europe. This &ldquo;<em>democratic</em> movement&rdquo; is causing Europeans to become more like one another. These new conditions are leading to the &ldquo;leveling&rdquo; of the European, who is becoming more mediocre but also more useful as a &ldquo;herd animal&rdquo;—meaning easier to control and manipulate. At the same time, this leveling will also produce some &ldquo;exceptional human beings of the most dangerous and attractive quality&rdquo;—meaning free spirits.</p><p>The first race Nietzsche considers in depth is the Germans, and much of what he says is not flattering. He calls the German soul &ldquo;manifold, of diverse origins.&rdquo; As a people, they are a &ldquo;monstrous mixture and medley of races,&rdquo; he says, with a &ldquo;preponderance of the pre-Aryan element,&rdquo; meaning barbarian. He jokes that they are incomprehensible and more frightening to themselves than to other people. Germans see themselves as always in the process of becoming or developing. This is a governing concept for them, that &ldquo;united with German beer and German music,&rdquo; is trying to &ldquo;Germanize the whole of Europe.&rdquo; He gives a brief critique of some prominent German musicians but then adds that the German race has no ear for good prose.</p><p>Nietzsche prefaces his remarks about races other than Germans by saying there are two types of geniuses—the one who &ldquo;begets&rdquo; and the one who &ldquo;wants to beget.&rdquo; The same can be said for peoples. Those peoples whom he equates with &ldquo;forming, maturing, and perfecting&rdquo; (as with pregnancy and birth) are the Greeks and the French (the feminine races). He identifies the masculine races (who want to fertilize and create &ldquo;new orders of life&rdquo;) as the Jews, Romans, and possibly the Germans. He stops to single out the Jews, to whom Europe owes many good and bad additions to culture, including &ldquo;the grand style of morality&rdquo; (i.e., the Hebrew Bible, also called the Old Testament by Christians). Nietzsche says he has never met a German &ldquo;well disposed toward the Jews,&rdquo; and that by and large anti-Semitism goes unchecked in Germany. He avows that the Jews are &ldquo;the strongest, toughest, and purest race now living in Europe; they know how to prevail under the worse conditions.&rdquo; He opines that if the Jews desired to (or if they were forced to because of anti-Semitism), they could master Europe, but that is not their aim. Rather, they wish to be assimilated and long to be &ldquo;fixed, permitted, respected somewhere at long last, putting an end to the nomads&rsquo; life,&rdquo; and &ldquo;to that end it might be useful and fair to expel the anti-Semitic screamers from the country.&rdquo; Thus, Nietzsche clearly takes a stand against Europe&rsquo;s, and in particular Germany&rsquo;s, historical anti-Semitism and clearly voices his respect for the Jewish people.</p><p>Next, Nietzsche turns to the English, pronouncing them &ldquo;no philosophical race,&rdquo; and calling out several English philosophers for ridicule. He calls Thomas Carlyle an &ldquo;insipid muddlehead&rdquo; who exemplifies the English in his lack of &ldquo;real <em>power</em> of spirituality, real <em>profundity</em> of spiritual perception.&rdquo; Thus, it is not surprising the English cling to Christianity, he says, because they need its discipline to be &ldquo;humanized.&rdquo; France, on the other hand, is praised for still being &ldquo;the seat of the most spiritual and sophisticated culture in Europe and the foremost school of taste.&rdquo; Nonetheless, he criticizes the French for their taste for democracy (&ldquo;the noisy twaddle of the democratic bourgeois&rdquo;). He singles out for serious praise the French novelist Henri Beyle (whose pen name is Stendhal). He calls Stendhal a &ldquo;discoverer of the soul,&rdquo; no doubt for his sharp psychological insights found in novels like <em>The Red and the Black</em> and the <em>Charterhouse of Parma</em>.</p><p>Nietzsche ends this sketch of ethnic generalizations by saying that despite &ldquo;the insanity of nationality &mldr; <em>Europe wants to become one</em>.&rdquo; The most profound men of the century have prepared for this &ldquo;new <em>synthesis</em>,&rdquo; he says, mentioning Napoleon, Stendhal, and Schopenhauer among them—even Richard Wagner. He cautions the reader not to be &ldquo;led astray&rdquo; about Wagner because of the composer&rsquo;s &ldquo;own misunderstandings,&rdquo; since &ldquo;geniuses of his type rarely have the right to understand themselves.&rdquo;</p><a href=#analysis-8><h2 id=analysis-8><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p>In

<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/author/ rel=noopener>Nietzsche</a> proposes the thesis that nationalist politics should be put aside and all Europe united as a civilization with one identity. According to Nietzschean critic Laurence Lampert, the philosopher begins Part 8 with an overture on composer Richard Wagner to show how people can get carried away with nationalism. Despite the amount of critique and criticism Nietzsche rained down on Wagner, he deeply admired him. Thus, he uses Wagner, says Lampert, to show that at times even good Europeans can get caught up in nationalist sentiment and local pride. This strategy is similar to what he has done in the previous part—to show how a true philosopher gets to the bottom of his prejudices.</p><p>Nietzsche quickly overcomes his nationalistic lapse, however, and turns to the pros and cons of establishing democratic rule in various European countries. Democracy is a great leveler, and the more distinguishing marks of privilege are abolished, the fewer differences there will be among classes of people. Along with increased opportunity, democracy also creates sameness. Nietzsche could have predicted the ubiquitous presence of certain fast-food chains in democratic countries, along with the sameness in the clothing people wear or the music to which they listen. Paradoxically, democracy also creates sameness in ideas and an environment in which it is easier to control the masses—the herd. At the same time democracy leaves room for extraordinary people to move to the head of the herd. Moreover, the free spirit is not as readily crushed in an open society.</p><p>Nietzsche&rsquo;s generalizations about the various ethnicities and nationalities that he mentions in Part 8 have provoked a variety of responses among critics and remain somewhat puzzling. It is hard to believe he expects the reader to take his sweeping statements entirely seriously, and it is important to look at the tone and &ldquo;listen&rdquo; to the way he sounds in various parts of the text—after all, he does fault the Germans for being tone deaf when it comes to prose. The remarks about Germans seem to be, for the most part, comic. Nietzsche appears to be very serious in his defense of the Jews. His assertion that Germans are a mixed race, mostly pre-Aryan, is a barb aimed at anti-Semites. By the time Nietzsche wrote <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em>, anti-Semitism and nationalism were rife in Europe and, to some degree, went hand in hand. As the Jews gained full rights as citizens, they were more economically active across national boundaries and thus held in suspicion because of growing nationalism among European countries. Besides, the Jews had a long and painful history of being marginalized as aliens all over Europe, which also accounts for European anti-Semitism. Nietzsche had broken with the Wagners—both Richard Wagner and his wife Cosima—at least partially because of their anti-Semitism. Moreover, Nietzsche&rsquo;s sister, also close to the Wagners, was anti-Semitic and became virulently so after marrying an anti-Semite in 1885; she and her brother became estranged as a result. Thus, Nietzsche may be going out of his way to disavow the anti-Semitism of his sister and ex-mentor and friend while poking fun at German anti-Semites.</p><p>Nietzsche also criticizes or praises other ethnic groups for various imagined virtues or flaws, but given what he has said so far about the need for truth seekers to constantly question their presuppositions and look at a variety of perspectives, it seems unlikely that he took his own generalizations to heart. He also contradicts himself in places—for example, both praising the French for their refinement and damning them for their penchant for democracy. He is particularly hard on the British philosophers, yet he allows that the utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill and the biologist Charles Darwin, although mediocre in Nietzsche&rsquo;s view, have their use for uncovering certain types of truth. Nietzsche&rsquo;s praise of Stendhal certainly seems genuine, along with his calibrated assessment of Wagner. His generalizations about whole nations, however, seem ridiculous and parodic and have the same flavor as his earlier comments about women in 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/part-7-summary/ rel=noopener>Part 7</a>. For example, he accuses the English of causing an &ldquo;an over-all depression of the European spirit&rdquo; with their &ldquo;profound normality,&rdquo; while railing against the French for being &ldquo;apes and mimes&rdquo; of British ideas. Perhaps he is lampooning the stereotyping of national character and even thinking of his own grandiose generalizations that form the basis for parts of his philosophy—specifically what he says about the Greeks, the Christians, the Romans, and the Germans. Nietzsche has taken as his work the deconstruction of received notions and unexamined prejudices, especially the prejudices of philosophers, so perhaps he is deconstructing himself in Part 8.</p><hr><a href=#part-9--what-is-noble--summary><h1 id=part-9--what-is-noble--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part 9 : What Is Noble | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-11><h2 id=summary-11><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p>The culminating part of <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> parses 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/author/ rel=noopener>Nietzsche</a>&rsquo;s ideas about order and rank in human society. Most of the ideas in 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/part-9-summary/ rel=noopener>Part 9</a> go against the grain of readers who have grown up in a representative democracy or subscribe to the Jeffersonian ideals of the American Constitution, but it is important when reading Nietzsche to attempt to put preconceived notions aside to properly give the philosopher a hearing. Rather than think about whether what he says is good or bad or whether the reader agrees with him, it might be better to look for what is <em>true</em>, if anything, in what he says.</p><p>Nietzsche begins by declaring that any improvement in the human species has been made possible by &ldquo;an aristocratic society,&rdquo; one in which order of rank was assigned, along with value differences among people and the imposition of a form of slavery. Moreover, such societies have also nurtured inner order of rank—&ldquo;the craving for an ever new widening of distances within the soul itself.&rdquo; In other words, according to Nietzsche, only in societies that enforce social and political distinctions is there a corresponding longing for certain individuals to &ldquo;overcome&rdquo; themselves and become a higher type of human being.</p><p>Next, Nietzsche asks the reader to face the truth about how &ldquo;higher culture on earth so far has begun.&rdquo; Strong warrior cultures with a lust for power took over weaker peoples who were perhaps farmers or traders. A healthy aristocracy &ldquo;experiences itself <em>not</em> as a function (whether of the monarchy or the commonwealth) [as was true in France, before the French Revolution] but as their <em>meaning</em> and highest justification.&rdquo; Thus, in a true aristocracy, all of society exists only for the sake of the aristocracy. Any number of slaves, used as instruments, can &ldquo;in good conscience&rdquo; be sacrificed so that &ldquo;a choice type of being&rdquo; might fulfill its destiny to rise to a &ldquo;higher state of being.&rdquo; Aristocrats naturally refrain from hurting and exploiting one another, in a show of &ldquo;good manners&rdquo; among equals, but if this courtesy is extended to everyone, &ldquo;as the <em>fundamental principle of society</em>,&rdquo; it becomes &ldquo;a will to the <em>denial</em> of life, a principle of disintegration and decay.&rdquo; This is because &ldquo;life itself is <em>essentially</em> appropriation, injury, overpowering of what is alien and weaker, suppression, hardness, imposition of one&rsquo;s own forms, in-corporation.&rdquo; Even the aristocratic &ldquo;body&rdquo; (community) is &ldquo;an incarnate will to power,&rdquo; which will &ldquo;grow, spread, seize, become predominant,&rdquo; not out of any feelings of morality or immorality but because it is a living body and &ldquo;life simply <em>is</em> will to power.&rdquo;</p><p>Section 260 is a key passage in <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em>, wherein Nietzsche explains master and slave moralities, which he has touched upon in an earlier work and explains in even more depth in <em>The Genealogy of Morals</em>, published in 1887. Two moralities exist in the world, of master and slave, and in all higher and &ldquo;mixed&rdquo; cultures there is a &ldquo;mediation between these two moralities &mldr; and at times they occur directly alongside each other—even in the same human being.&rdquo; Moral discrimination began with the rulers, who were delighted to be different from the slaves they ruled. The noble, exalted ones separated themselves from the slaves, whom they despised. In this stage &ldquo;good&rdquo; and &ldquo;bad&rdquo; meant the same as &ldquo;noble&rdquo; and &ldquo;contemptible.&rdquo; Thus, the nobles felt contempt for &ldquo;the cowardly, the anxious &mldr; those who humble themselves &mldr; the begging flatterers, above all the liars.&rdquo; The noble ones believe they never lie, says Nietzsche.</p><p>Gradually, the terms good and bad, first applied to people, came to be applied to actions. The noble ones experience themselves as &ldquo;determining values&rdquo;—which is to say that if it is bad for them, then it is bad. The noble ones are sometimes charitable, but not out of pity, but rather as an expression of an &ldquo;excess of power.&rdquo; The noble ones delight in being hard on themselves, as an expression of having power over themselves. Most distasteful to modern man, says Nietzsche, is the idea that the ruling group feels no obligation to any but its own class and can behave as it sees fit toward those of lower ranks.</p><p>On the other hand, the slave is skeptical about what the noble calls <em>good</em>. Slave morality is &ldquo;a morality of utility.&rdquo; Qualities that are honored include &ldquo;pity &mldr; patience, industry, humility, and friendliness,&rdquo; which can help the slave endure their life. For the slaves &ldquo;those who are &rsquo;evil&rsquo; &mldr; inspire fear,&rdquo; while a good person is &ldquo;<em>undangerous</em>&rdquo; and perhaps &ldquo;good-natured, easy to deceive, a little stupid.&rdquo; The longing for freedom is a key aspect of slave morality, just as reverence and devotion are key to aristocratic ways of thinking.</p><p>Beginning in section 268, Nietzsche raises the problem of language—or communication between those of different ranks or sensibilities. It is important to have experience in common with others to understand their language. Language here is used in both the literal and metaphorical sense: people may have a language in common, but they understand each other best if they share a common world of experience, embedded in the layers of linguistic meaning. Thus, average people who have common experiences encounter more people who understand them because there are more <em>others</em> like them. Those out of the norm find themselves alone and isolated and not easily understood, and they have a difficult time finding mates. The &ldquo;spiritual haughtiness and nausea&rdquo; of people who have experienced deep suffering also determines rank order, and those who have suffered profoundly disguise themselves and their suffering. They pride themselves on being &ldquo;the elect of knowledge&rdquo; but protect themselves from the pity of those who have not suffered. &ldquo;Profound suffering makes noble; it separates.&rdquo;</p><p>In section 287 Nietzsche turns to ask what the word &ldquo;noble&rdquo; can mean in modern society, now that &ldquo;the beginning rule of the plebs&rdquo; has made &ldquo;everything opaque and leaden?&rdquo; Nietzsche answers, &ldquo;<em>The noble soul has reverence for itself</em>.&rdquo; This is true, regardless of whether the noble one earns name and fame. When a person has been sitting alone in their metaphorical cave, &ldquo;year in and year out,&rdquo; they become a dragon of sorts, guarding his treasure. Such a hermit does not believe that any philosopher &ldquo;expressed his real and ultimate opinions in books.&rdquo; Rather they write books to conceal what they know. What philosopher can have &ldquo;ultimate and real&rdquo; opinions, Nietzsche asks, when behind every one of their caves is &ldquo;another deeper cave—a more comprehensive, stranger, richer world beyond the surface, an abysmally deep ground behind every ground, under every attempt to furnish &lsquo;grounds.&rsquo; Every philosophy is a foreground philosophy &mldr; [and] <em>conceals</em> a philosophy; every opinion is also a hideout, every word also a mask.&rdquo;</p><p>In contrast to the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes, Nietzsche does not find laughter suspect. Rather, he would &ldquo;risk an order of rank among philosophers depending on the rank of their laughter—all the way up those capable of <em>golden</em> laughter.&rdquo; 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/symbols/#Laughter rel=noopener>Laughter</a> for Nietzsche is a symbol of the joyous affirmation of life. According to Nietzsche&rsquo;s Dionysian vision, the free spirit must say <em>Yes</em> to everything, even the tragic, and sometimes to say <em>Yes</em> to tragedy a little seasoning of laughter is in order.</p><p>Section 295 of Part 9 is a beautiful, haunting prose poem to Nietzsche&rsquo;s god Dionysus, &ldquo;the genius of the heart,&rdquo; who, among other things &ldquo;smooths rough souls and lets them taste a new desire—to lie still as a mirror, that the deep sky may mirror itself in them.&rdquo; Dionysus is the Greek god of ecstatic vision. In <em>The Birth of Tragedy</em> Dionysus stands for &ldquo;uncontrolled, frenzied, intoxicated passion and is contrasted to Apollo,&rdquo; the god of reason, translator Walter Kaufman says. But in <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> he stands for &ldquo;controlled and creatively employed passion.&rdquo; Nietzsche says he has learned a lot about &ldquo;the philosophy of this god [Dionysus]&rdquo; as his &ldquo;last disciple and initiate,&rdquo; and he offers to readers—addressing them as &ldquo;my friends&rdquo;—&ldquo;a few tastes of this philosophy, insofar as this is permitted to me.&rdquo; He admits it concerns much that is &ldquo;secret, new, strange, odd, uncanny.&rdquo; In section 296 Nietzsche ends by sadly addressing his &ldquo;painted&rdquo; thoughts, which he fears are ready &ldquo;to become truths.&rdquo; He compares himself to a Chinese painter who attempts to immortalize the flight of a captured bird—but captures merely a shadow of the original once the image has been committed to paper. Such is also the case with Nietzsche&rsquo;s thoughts—the words that he writes can never reflect the true glory of his ideas.</p><a href=#analysis-9><h2 id=analysis-9><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p>While 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/author/ rel=noopener>Nietzsche</a>&rsquo;s explanation of how master and slave morality evolved may at first seem far-fetched, a look at history confirms his essential correctness, if the reader steps back and does not superimpose a value judgment on the word &ldquo;morality.&rdquo; That is, the reader ought to suspend the modern definition of treating all people fairly, or following the laws of the reader&rsquo;s country, or following the tenets of the reader&rsquo;s religion. When Nietzsche says &ldquo;master morality,&rdquo; he is referring to the traditional code of behavior of ancient rulers, and when he says &ldquo;slave morality,&rdquo; he is referring to the enforced code of behavior of subjected peoples in those same eras. However, master and slave moralities still exist, in that there are still rulers and subjected peoples in the world.</p><p>Returning to the origin of these moralities, the reader can think about ancient Rome, for example, or ancient Egypt, in which aristocratic rulers lorded over large groups of subjected peoples—many of them literally slaves with very little control over their own lives. For example, in ancient Rome, a slave might be a gladiator doomed to an early death in the Roman arena or a female slave forced to be the concubine of a powerful person. The Roman Empire had a complex, hierarchical class structure in which a person&rsquo;s rights and duties, as modern people would understand them, differed according to rank. Patricians, the highest class of Romans, wore special clothing to denote their rank, and other classes had to publicly show them deference. Slaves had no rights at all and were of no concern to the government. They could be punished in any way deemed appropriate by their masters, and slaves who killed or revolted against masters were severely tortured before being killed. While Nietzsche may exaggerate the degree to which aristocrats could do what they liked (since they governed themselves according to a set of rules), they had enormous power and complete power over slave populations. Further, their idea of duty to other people extended only to members of their own class and those they had chosen to patronize. Thus, what was good for them was good for society, as Nietzsche argues. Clearly, for a slave to stay alive in the Roman Empire, they would need to constantly practice the &ldquo;virtues&rdquo; of kindness, patience, humility, and the like with regard to their &ldquo;betters.&rdquo;</p><p>This type of behavior—the unbridled seizing of privilege on the part of a ruling class—has not disappeared from the world. First, there is more than one totalitarian regime today in which the majority of people are not free. In these countries, the ruler or rulers have the power to do as they like and force &ldquo;laws&rdquo; on the populace that they themselves do not follow. Totalitarian regimes sometimes force a population into virtual slavery, disguising it as dedication to the state and pretending that the toil of the people benefits everyone. Even in representative democracies there is a ruling class of people with financial resources an ordinary person would find staggering, and the ruling class is continually trying to grab more power to increase their wealth and influence. Although they may pay lip service to democratic values, they are mainly interested in working the system to accumulate more power, and there is a constant battle going on between this ruling class and the forces in representative democracies that attempt to preserve benefits and freedoms for the working and middle classes and the poor.</p><p>Nietzsche believes that this will to dominate, seize, control, and extend oneself and one&rsquo;s influence is natural, and that to pretend otherwise is to be in &ldquo;bad faith,&rdquo; which is an existentialist term for the refusal to confront the facts at hand or the choices they indicate. While Nietzsche condones this natural &ldquo;will to power&rdquo; in human beings and all that it implies, he does so mostly to shake people up so that they may realize that their morality is not based on some universal metaphysical principle that applies for all time, in all places in the universe. Rather, human ideas about morality have mostly emerged as a result of human necessity (there is some evidence that basic concepts of fairness are genetically determined) and a way to negotiate power relations among people. Thus, in an aristocratic society, what is moral is determined by the rulers, according to what benefits them, and the subjected people create a morality that will allow them to survive in their conditions. This includes naming their persecutors as evil, which affords them some measure of psychological solace. In societies in which power is shared, it becomes necessary to make people as harmless as possible. This is done by enacting and enforcing codes of law and rewarding people for following the rules while punishing law breakers. In a democratic society, what is good is that which allows individuals to exercise as much freedom as possible without infringing on the freedom of others, while evil is defined as persons and forces that take away that freedom.</p><p>Nietzsche expresses skepticism about future enhancements of society in which exploitation will be abolished, since he doesn&rsquo;t view it as &ldquo;corrupt or imperfect,&rdquo; but rather as &ldquo;a basic organic function.&rdquo; The reader may find Nietzsche hard-hearted in this regard, but consider that, as a truth-teller, he clearly saw what people are like; and as perhaps the first existential philosopher, he took a stand to determine the meaning of his life by defining himself and his mission. He determined that life is good and worth living and must be embraced without reservation. He took his mission to be telling the truth and exposing the lie. For Nietzsche, embracing life meant embracing humanity as it is, with all its ugliness. For the centuries after Christianity displaced the religions of the Roman Empire, Christianity enforced the morality of subjugation (in Nietzsche&rsquo;s view) and kept people in line. But as religion lost its hold, philosophers sought to create a secular underpinning and justifications for the prevailing morality. This is where Nietzsche objects: for him moral philosophy and metaphysical justifications for the existence of &ldquo;the good&rdquo; are no more than religion warmed over. Nietzsche also sees the down side of democratic flattening. Democracy tends to impose its own brand of rigid conformity through the popular vote and popular opinion, ostracizing (excluding) people who do not agree. Public opinion and majority rule tend to give pride of place to the lowest common denominator. Or to put it another way, the vast majority of people are not exceptional, and when the unexceptional rule, they do not encourage humanity to move in the direction of self-overcoming, according to Nietzsche&rsquo;s definition.</p><p>Nietzsche also applies nobility to the internal world and shows how it is possible to be a free spirit in the worst conditions. He himself faced the pain of being ahead of his time and misunderstood and unappreciated by his peers. He also suffered loneliness and did not succeed in finding a spouse to share his life with. He says in this last part that this is often the fate of the free spirit—the person who suffers profoundly to uncover the truth. Further, he suffered terrible debilitating illness for most of his life and yet was able to maintain his cheerfulness and produce brilliant books of philosophy. Most tragic, he spent the last 11 years of his life in madness, at the mercy of his caretakers—and not all of them had his best interests at heart. Yet, while he still had his faculties, he maintained reverence for himself, as a noble soul ought to do, according to his philosophy. Such exceptional individuals are brave enough to face up to the fact that their toil in the realm of the mind is on some level futile—even though necessary. Like Sisyphus of Greek myth, who must continue to roll his boulder up the hill every day even though it falls down every night, the free spirits and philosophers must continue to say their partial truths, fully knowing that &ldquo;every philosophy is a foreground philosophy &mldr; [and] <em>conceals</em> a philosophy; every opinion is also a hideout, every word also a mask.&rdquo;</p><hr><a href=#from-high-mountains-aftersong--summary><h1 id=from-high-mountains-aftersong--summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>From High Mountains: Aftersong | Summary</h1></a><a href=#summary-12><h2 id=summary-12><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Summary</h2></a><p>The final part of <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> is a poem expressing his loneliness as he waits for kindred spirits to join him in the high mountains of his philosophical thoughts. &ldquo;Higher than mine no table has been set,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;My realm, like none, is almost infinite.&rdquo; When his old friends arrive, they do not recognize him at first. That is because he has perhaps &ldquo;become a ghost that wanders over glaciers.&rdquo; He tells these old friends they can leave, since they can&rsquo;t live with him among the &ldquo;ice and rock,&rdquo; where he has learned to bend a bow and strike with an arrow that no one else can send. The poet does not shut his gate, however, hoping &ldquo;new friends may come along.&rdquo; While the poet was once young, he has grown younger, while the friends of old have aged &ldquo;and lost our old affinity: /One has to change to stay akin to me.&rdquo; He continues to wait for new friends, who still have not arrived. Finally, &ldquo;one turned into two,&rdquo; and they celebrate with a feast. &ldquo;Friend Zarathustra&rdquo; has arrived, &ldquo;the guest of guests! &mldr; The wedding is at hand of dark and light.&rdquo;</p><a href=#analysis-10><h2 id=analysis-10><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Analysis</h2></a><p>In this epilogue of sorts 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/author/ rel=noopener>Nietzsche</a>, the speaker of the poem, casts himself in the role of the overman. He has come by his truths honestly, through pain and suffering, and he is like a ghost who has been wandering among glaciers. His quest for knowledge, however, has made him younger, while his old friends have grown old because they have stayed in one place. He, on the other hand has kept moving mentally, unafraid of new ideas and insight. He has grown strong enough to bend the bow and send the arrow, which he spoke about in the prologue, into the future where the arrow has finally hit its target. The profound loneliness that Nietzsche has felt in being a thinker ahead of his time comes through in the poem, even if it is not equal to his prose writing in terms of sophistication, style, or profundity. Still, it is straight from the heart. Nietzsche was not wrong to think he was a philosopher of the future, only appreciated after his death. In the poem, he imagines his kindred spirit as Zarathustra, a Beloved of sorts, and also the sage of his previous book. No longer alone, he and Zarathustra together await the marriage of dark and light, and the dawning of the era beyond good and evil.</p><hr><a href=#quotes><h1 id=quotes><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Quotes</h1></a><ol><li></li></ol><p> > Every great philosophy &mldr; [is an] unconscious memoir &mldr; [and] the moral &mldr; intentions in every philosophy [are] the germ &mldr; from which the whole plant [has] grown. </p><p>Narrator, 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/part-1-summary/ rel=noopener>Part 1</a></p><p>Nietzsche argues that every philosopher has an unconscious, moral agenda. Philosophy itself is an unconscious memoir because it reflects the authors&rsquo; view of the meaning of life, based on their experience. Their philosophy is, in some sense, an extension of religion, in that it always has a moral intent—philosophy is a spiritual pursuit. Thus, Nietzsche does not believe that &ldquo;a drive for knowledge&rdquo; is at the root of philosophy, but rather a desire to represent the purpose of existence as the philosopher sees it.</p><ol start=2><li></li></ol><p> > Life itself is <em>will</em> to power; self-preservation is only one of the indirect and most frequent <em>results</em>. </p><p>Narrator,

Will to power, the desire to discharge strength, is the &ldquo;cardinal instinct of the organic being,&rdquo; Nietzsche says. Therefore, self-preservation—which is needed to exercise will to power—is merely a by-product of will to power.</p><ol start=3><li></li></ol><blockquote><p> Independence is for the very few; it is a privilege of the strong. </p></blockquote><p>Narrator,

Nietzsche borrows the image from Greek mythology, in which the hero Theseus entered the labyrinth and slew the monster, the minotaur. The labyrinth symbolizes the depths of the mind, including unconscious thoughts and desires. It takes a strong person to turn their back on conventional thought and explore the truths about life and the self, which can be found in one&rsquo;s own mind.

In his view these religions create a metaphysical higher order that simply does not exist and promise their followers a place in this fake realm. For Christians this is heaven, after death. For Buddhists it is nirvana, reached upon enlightenment (a state of mind beyond sorrow).

<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/part-5-summary/ rel=noopener>Part 5</a></p><p>Nietzsche prefigures modern neuroscience in this quote, although he does not realize that the image is actually produced in the brain. But what he gets right is his observation that people often don&rsquo;t see what they are looking at—rather they see an old image already in their brain and don&rsquo;t take in the new impression. For example, sometimes it takes a few days before people realize a person they are close to shaved their beard or cut their hair because people often don&rsquo;t look at each other but rather at the image in their mind of the other person.</p><ol start=9><li></li></ol><blockquote><p> No father contests his own right to subject [his child] to <em>his</em> concepts and valuations. </p></blockquote><p>Narrator,

Here he opines that parents believe a child is their possession, and they can thus subject the child to their own worldviews and values and essentially brainwash the child.

In the preface 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/author/ rel=noopener>Nietzsche</a> notes that all worthwhile endeavors, such as philosophy, must first appear &ldquo;in monstrous and frightening masks&rdquo; to make an impression on humanity. In this instance, he is referring to dogmatic philosophy, which masks higher philosophy.</p><p>In 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/part-9-summary/ rel=noopener>Part 9</a>, at the end of his treatise, Nietzsche says free spirits and philosophers must continue to say their partial truths, fully knowing that &ldquo;every philosophy is a foreground philosophy &mldr; [and] <em>conceals</em> a philosophy; every opinion is also a hideout, every word also a mask.&rdquo; In this instance words mask the truth because words can never fully explain a philosophical realization in its fullness, which is beyond words. In between, Nietzsche notes that people use masks to hide the truth and philosophers use masks to protect profound thoughts from those not prepared to hear them. They also use masks to protect themselves, these profound spirits, from all who would misunderstand them.</p><a href=#mirror><h2 id=mirror><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Mirror</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/author/ rel=noopener>Nietzsche</a> uses the mirror to symbolize the mind&rsquo;s reflection of the sensible world. This symbol is both positive and negative. In 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/part-6-summary/ rel=noopener>Part 6</a> the mirror turns the scholar into an instrument who merely reflects what wants to be known. The mirror represents the scholar&rsquo;s limitations; they can merely regurgitate what other people have said and fear taking a stand on any subject. In 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/part-9-summary/ rel=noopener>Part 9</a>, however, the mirror is a gift from Dionysius in which the free spirit and true philosopher can observe the manifest world and reflect the &ldquo;deep sky&rdquo; of knowledge. Nietzsche refers to Dionysius as &ldquo;the genius of the heart [who] smooths rough souls and lets them taste a new desire—to lie still as a mirror, that the deep sky may mirror itself in them.&rdquo; Thus, the mirror becomes a metaphor for the still mind that can see clearly.</p><a href=#laughter><h2 id=laughter><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Laughter</h2></a><p>For 
<a href=https://www.coursehero.com/lit/Beyond-Good-and-Evil/author/ rel=noopener>Nietzsche</a>, laughter symbolizes an openness to life and an unconditional <em>Yes</em> to what is. In <em>Human, All-Too-Human</em>, Nietzsche says: &ldquo;The more joyous and certain his spirit becomes, the more man unlearns loud laughter; instead a more spiritual smile constantly wells up in him.&rdquo; Moreover, according to translator Walter Kaufmann, Nietzsche&rsquo;s celebration of laughter can also be found in <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em>. Kaufmann singles out three important references in that text: the first mentions laughter as a way to &ldquo;kill the spirit of gravity.&rdquo; In another passage, an inability to laugh is equated with tense souls, particularly someone who has just returned from &ldquo;the woods of knowledge.&rdquo; In a third passage, Zarathustra pronounces laughter as &ldquo;holy.&rdquo; Kaufmann says that for Nietzsche laughter &ldquo;is a symbol of the joyous affirmation of life and of the refusal to bow before the spirit of gravity.&rdquo;</p><p>In <em>Beyond Good and Evil,</em> Nietzsche specifically mentions Aristophanes, the author of the Greek comedies, whose &ldquo;transfiguring, complementary spirit&rdquo; is enough to forgive &ldquo;everything Hellenic for having existed.&rdquo; He also mentions how he reconsidered Plato after learning that underneath Plato&rsquo;s pillow after he had died was found a volume of the great dramatist. Plato famously denounced the theater, and yet, as Nietzsche points out, &ldquo;How could even Plato have endured life—a Greek life he repudiated—without an Aristophanes?&rdquo; Comedy is the flip side of tragedy, after all, and according to Nietzsche they are not so much opposites as moments on the same continuum. Life is tragic and necessitates laughter.</p><hr><a href=#glossary><h1 id=glossary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Glossary</h1></a><p><strong>affects:</strong> <em>(n)</em> feelings; in this text, overtones of Baruch Spinoza&rsquo;s &ldquo;affectus,&rdquo; which is a motivation to act stimulated by a feeling</p><p><strong>cant:</strong> <em>(n)</em> hypocritical talk about religion, politics, or social issues; phony pronouncements</p><p><strong>categorical imperative:</strong> <em>(n)</em> universal law; a specific term in Kantian philosophy referring to an unconditional requirement that remains the same in all circumstances</p><p><strong><em>causa prima</em>:</strong> <em>(n)</em> first cause; prime mover; God; creation of the world</p><p><strong><em>causa sui</em>:</strong> <em>(n)</em> self-generated cause; self-designated purpose of existence</p><p><strong>dialectical:</strong> <em>(adj)</em> relating to the juxtaposition of opposing forces</p><p><strong>epiphenomenon:</strong> <em>(n)</em> a secondary phenomenon and therefore a secondary effect</p><p><strong>metaphysical:</strong> <em>(adj)</em> relating to metaphysics, i.e., something that does not appear in the material realm but is thought to belong to or exist in the immaterial realm</p><p><strong>phenomenon:</strong> <em>(n)</em> an object or action of perception that the mind notices</p><p><strong>philology:</strong> <em>(n)</em> the branch of knowledge that deals with the structure, historical development, and relationships of a language or languages</p><p><strong>reify:</strong> <em>(v)</em> to bestow form and content; to make something more concrete or real</p><p><strong>supersensible:</strong> <em>(adj)</em> above or beyond what is perceived by the senses</p><p><strong>Tartuffery:</strong> <em>(n)</em> hypocrisy; based on a character in a play by French playwright Molière who is a pious (religious) fraud</p><p><strong>teleological:</strong> <em>(adj)</em> relating to the explanation of phenomena by looking at end purposes, functions, or goals</p><hr><a href=#biography><h1 id=biography><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Biography</h1></a><p>The son and grandson of Lutheran clergymen, Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche was born October 15, 1844, in the small Prussian village of Röcken, southwest of what is now Leipzig, Germany. Karl Ludwig, Nietzsche&rsquo;s father, died before the philosopher was five, and his younger brother Ludwig Joseph died shortly after. After Karl Ludwig&rsquo;s death, the family left the house that had been earmarked for the deceased pastor and his family and moved to Naumburg, a town on the river Saale in rural Saxony. Nietzsche grew up in a household of women that included his mother, grandmother, two of his father&rsquo;s sisters, and his younger sister Elisabeth. He attended a private preparatory school and in 1858 was admitted to Schulpforta, a prestigious Protestant boarding school. There he met his lifelong friend Paul Deussen, who would later become a historian of philosophy and religion. From Deussen, Nietzsche would later learn Indian Vedanta, a philosophy based on the sacred Hindu Veda texts, and then critique it as a nihilist philosophy based on a denial of objective truth, along with Platonism and Christianity.</p><a href=#university-education><h3 id=university-education><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>University Education</h3></a><p>In 1864 he graduated from Schulpforta and entered the University of Bonn, majoring in theology and classical philology, which is the study of language in historical texts, combining literary criticism, history, and linguistics. As a student of classical philology, Nietzsche studied classical Greek, Latin, and Biblical texts. In 1865 he transferred to the University of Leipzig and discovered the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer. Nietzsche became a disciple of this atheist German philosopher for a time but later repudiated him. Nonetheless, Schopenhauer&rsquo;s philosophy certainly had an impact on his thinking, particularly on his theory of the &ldquo;will to power.&rdquo; Nietzsche&rsquo;s education was briefly interrupted with mandatory military service, beginning in October 1867. Assigned to an equestrian artillery unit, Nietzsche seriously hurt himself while trying to run and mount a horse. A chest injury that would not heal allowed him to return to school in 1868. He met the great German composer Richard Wagner in that same year, and the two became close friends. Wagner was something of a father figure to Nietzsche, coincidentally born in the same year as Nietzsche&rsquo;s late father, and they shared a passion for Schopenhauer as well as music. Nietzsche was an amateur composer.</p><a href=#professor-of-philology><h3 id=professor-of-philology><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Professor of Philology</h3></a><p>In 1869 Nietzsche&rsquo;s classics professor and mentor Friedrich Wilhelm Ritschl recommended him for a professorship in Basel, Switzerland, even though he had not completed his doctoral dissertation. The school in Basel asked him to renounce his Prussian citizenship, and Nietzsche did so, although he never became a Swiss national. Thus, he was a man without a country from 1869 until the end of his life. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Leipzig that same year, based on his published writings, and he was appointed to the University of Basel as a professor in classical philology. Despite renouncing his Prussian citizenship, Nietzsche served briefly as a volunteer medic when the Franco-Prussian (1870–71) war broke out, but he got sick almost immediately with dysentery and diphtheria and was sent back to Basel, where he resumed teaching. There Nietzsche met historian Franz Overbeck, who became a lifelong friend. Although an excellent teacher, Nietzsche was already tired of philology and university life and had turned toward philosophy by 1871.</p><p>Starting in 1871 the Nietzsche began to suffer serious, debilitating illnesses. He had suffered from debilitating headaches since childhood, but now they kept him in bed for days and caused him to be absent from the university. Nonetheless, he completed his first major work, <em>The Birth of Tragedy</em>, which was published in 1872. This work was poorly received by academia because it did not meet traditional standards of academic rigor and was a philosophical rather than philological work. Some 40 years later, this early foray into philosophy was called &ldquo;a work of profound imaginative insight&rdquo; by the British classicist F.M. Cornford, according to Nietzsche scholar Bernd Magnus. Nonetheless, <em>The Birth of Tragedy</em> was condemned by a leading philologist of Nietzsche&rsquo;s era, and others followed suit. This did not help Nietzsche&rsquo;s career as either a writer or teacher. At the same time, he was spending less and less time at his job because of illness. From 1873 to 1876 Nietzsche published a series of essays that came to be known as the <em>Untimely Meditations.</em> By 1876 his relationship with Wagner and his family had run its course. Nietzsche became disillusioned with Wagner&rsquo;s nationalism, embrace of Christianity, and perhaps his anti-Semitism, and they grew further apart philosophically because Nietzsche had turned his back on Schopenhauer.</p><a href=#nietzsches-decade-of-genius><h3 id=nietzsches-decade-of-genius><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Nietzsche&rsquo;s Decade of Genius</h3></a><p>Nietzsche received sick leave from the university in 1877 and wrote a second volume, <em>Human, All-Too-Human</em>, in 1878. His health continued to deteriorate, and he ended up resigning his chair at the university in 1879 and was granted a pension. For the next decade, he suffered continuous pain caused by his various illnesses and lived as an intellectual vagabond, moving from place to place in Switzerland, southern France, and Italy, in search of a hospitable climate. He lived alone for the most part, and although he had friends, he spent most of his time in his own company. During this period, he was introduced to Lou Salomé, a brilliant young Russian woman, by his Swiss friend Paul Rée. Nietzsche fell madly in love with her, and although she appreciated Nietzsche&rsquo;s intellect, Salomé did not return his romantic feelings. In any case, Rée was already in love with her, and the younger couple ended up moving away together, leaving Nietzsche alone.</p><p>In this decade Nietzsche produced <em>The Dawn</em> (1881), <em>The Gay Science</em> (1882), and <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em> (1883–85), a masterpiece cast in four volumes. <em>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</em> imitates sacred texts and waxes poetic, parodic, and satirical while laying out all the philosopher&rsquo;s major ideas. He also rewrote <em>The Gay Science</em> in 1887 and provided new introductions for some of his older books as his philosophical thought evolved. Nietzsche produced <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> (1886) and <em>On the Genealogy of Morals</em> (1887) as alternative texts presenting the key concepts in <em>Zarathustra</em> in a more straightforward and accessible format. Nonetheless, his works continued to go unread and were largely unappreciated in his own lifetime. In his last year before his decent into madness in 1889, he produced <em>Twilight of the Idols</em>, <em>The Antichrist,</em> <em>The Case of Wagner</em>, <em>Nietzsche contra Wagner</em>, and <em>Ecce Homo</em>_,_ an intellectual autobiography.</p><a href=#descent-into-madness><h3 id=descent-into-madness><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Descent into Madness</h3></a><p>Nietzsche collapsed in Turin, Italy, in 1889, and his friend Overbeck took him back to Basel after this complete mental breakdown, from which he never recovered. He lived first in an asylum and then moved back to Naumburg with his mother. When she died in 1897, he was moved to Weimar to live with his sister Elisabeth. Until recently Nietzsche&rsquo;s loss of his mental faculties during the last 11 years of his life has been attributed to an atypical paralysis caused by a dormant form of syphilis. It was assumed he had picked up this sexually transmitted disease from a prostitute in a brothel during his student days, which added to his other illnesses and became active in the last part of his life. However, more recently it has been argued that he likely had retro-orbital meningioma, or a slow-growing tumor on the brain surface behind his right eye, which might account for his partial blindness and headaches.</p><p>When Nietzsche&rsquo;s sister Elisabeth assumed care of her brother, she gained control over his literary works and began publishing sections from his voluminous unpublished notes and materials—called the <em>Nachlass</em>. These were writings from Nietzsche&rsquo;s notebooks, and she compiled one volume titled <em>The Will to Power</em>. She further fostered misleading ideas about the content of the rest of his unpublished works and even produced some minor forgeries. In fact, Elisabeth excised portions of his work and deliberately linked her brother with her own anti-Semitic views. She established an archive of Nietzsche&rsquo;s work in Naumburg, the town where they had grown up. This place became a sort of museum in which the mad philosopher himself was shown as an exhibit to certain important visitors. Elisabeth, who had married an anti-Semite who killed himself in 1889, grew rich on her brother&rsquo;s writings and misrepresented them by plundering and publishing work that he never meant to share with the public. She even gave him a Lutheran funeral when he died on August 25, 1900, something that would have horrified the man who had charged religion, particularly Christianity, with creating a slave morality. He had, in fact, asked for a pagan burial.</p><p>The influence of Friedrich Nietzsche on philosophy, psychology, and the arts has been incalculable, and it is not an exaggeration to say that he has influenced—both directly and indirectly—most of the important thinkers and artists of 20th and 21st centuries. Some of the towering figures of the 19th and 20th century influenced by his ideas include the father of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud; the father of analytical psychology, Carl Jung; Prussian philosopher Karl Marx; the early existentialist philosophers, including Martin Heidegger, Jean Paul Sartre, and Hannah Arendt; literary and social critic Jacques Derrida; theologians Martin Buber and Paul Tillich; and literary giants such as Thomas Mann and Rainer Maria Rilke. The majority of his ideas remain fresh and startling today despite the passage of time and the corrections that have been made to parts of his philosophy by those who followed him.</p><hr><a href=#10-things-you-didnt-know><h1 id=10-things-you-didnt-know><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>10 Things You Didn&rsquo;t Know</h1></a><p>Friedrich Nietzsche, one of the most renowned philosophers in history, was a 19th-century German philosopher who wrote on existentialism and promoted of atheism. One of his masterworks, <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em>, is a fundamental text of philosophical thought that many scholars consider to be truly ahead of its time. Published in 1886, it challenges many preconceived notions of philosophy that had been in place for millennia.</p><p>As the title suggests, <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> encourages readers to ponder life&rsquo;s greatest questions outside the constraints of commonly accepted morality. Nietzsche takes aim, in particular, at Christian morality, which he considered outdated, abused, and misinformed. Since the vast majority of continental European philosophy in previous centuries had been written in a Christian framework, <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em> was truly a groundbreaking work.</p><a href=#1-although-he-was-german-nietzsche-thought-the-french-were-more-culturally-advanced-than-germans><h2 id=1-although-he-was-german-nietzsche-thought-the-french-were-more-culturally-advanced-than-germans><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>1.

The philosopher once famously declared: &ldquo;There have been two great narcotics in European civilization: Christianity and alcohol.&rdquo; He believed Christianity was harmful because it encouraged repression, which he thought led to moral cowardice and stifled creativity. Nietzsche&rsquo;s disdain for alcohol and religion apparently didn&rsquo;t extend to opium, an actual narcotic, which he

Nietzsche viewed the rapid democratization of European states as a void in which tyrants (such as German dictator Adolf Hitler and Italian dictator Benito Mussolini) could easily rise to power. He also viewed it as a potential source for an increase in the disparity between rich and poor classes. Nietzsche explains:</p><blockquote><p> The democratization of Europe will lead to the production of a type prepared for slavery in the subtlest sense: in individual and exceptional cases the strong man will be found to turn out stronger and richer than has perhaps ever happened before &mldr; What I mean to say is that the democratization of Europe is at the same time an involuntary arrangement for the breeding of tyrants—in every sense of that word, including the most spiritual. </p></blockquote><a href=#5-as-a-youth-nietzsche-had-a-strange-relationship-with-a-drunken-poet><h2 id=5-as-a-youth-nietzsche-had-a-strange-relationship-with-a-drunken-poet><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>5.

Ortlepp became a father figure to Nietzsche, helping him develop his writing. However, Ortlepp was also a notorious drunk and would stumble around town singing blasphemous tunes, occasionally spending his nights in the drunk tank, where authorities placed intoxicated people found to be disturbing the peace. Scholars have speculated on the strange relationship between Nietzsche and his mentor.
