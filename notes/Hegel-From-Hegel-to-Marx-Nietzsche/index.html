<strong>contingency</strong> however and this is important to understand Hegel&rsquo;s quest for necessity unlike perhaps from an analytic perspective does not mean that he has the intention to sort of speak out
do away with anything that is contingent and then end up only with that which is necessary, instead by understanding <em>the equal necessity of each moment of a living whole by understanding the equal necessity which alone constitutes the life of the whole</em>.
what we have to do is more precisely, in a scientific system in philosophy as a science, to transform that which seems to be contingent into something that we understand as being actually necessary. so in this sense i think the <em>task of the phenomenology of spirit is to transform our understanding of that which in the first place seems to be merely coincidental merely contingent to something that of which we recognize its necessity</em> - the transformation of contingency into necessity.</p><p>let me try to explain this with two examples that are not from hegel:</p><ul><li><p><strong>first one would be a soccer game</strong>. if we are at any moment in a soccer game and we look forward to the future of the soccer game then everything seems and actually is contingent, right? anything can happen in the future of that game. so however if at the end of the game we look backward, in order to completely understand analyze the actual game as it really [virklish] actually took place, we need to understand how and in which way each moment each move of the game was equally necessary to constitute make this specific game that we just watched. so in hindsight we can transform that which was contingent into something that now we understand was somehow necessary. so hegel calls this the rational and the rhythm of the organic whole, that&rsquo;s the organism this is what philosophy does in hindsight, it transforms that which once was contingent into something that now because of the actuality of the reality we understand as necessary.</p></li><li><p>so the same thing can be explained with a love song by slavo zizek that you can find on youtube falling in love. it&rsquo;s some lecture or speech by Zizek which then someone transformed into a song and in this song zizek talks about in his own words about a totally contingent encounter with someone saying you might stumble on the street and then someone helps you and then you fall in love with that person. and then it this is as Zizek says <em>the love of your life</em>. so this is like a typical way of how people can fall in love with one another now and as Zizek says it is grounded in a total contingency. however once the falling in love has happened and then, Zizek says interestingly, <em>you perceive your entire past life as leading to this moment and you say to yourself something like i was waiting all my life for you right and so here</em>.</p></li></ul><p>exactly the same thing happens as that would hegel does in the phenomenology of spirit: <em>you transform that which has been entirely contingent into something that now totally makes sense and is necessary and seems as somehow the logical conclusion of that which happened before and led up to this event</em>. so again we have the transformation of contingency into necessity.</p><p>so this is why going back to hegel he speaks in the phenomenology of spirit: of the necessity of progression and interrelation. this means to make sense of an event by understanding the dynamic necessity in the context of an organic whole, of the life of the whole of a certain rhythm of a certain progress and process.</p><p>now to go a step further i want to talk about in addition to the dynamic organic meaning of necessity, about its existential meaning it&rsquo;s another layer of necessity in hegel. and in order to do this we going to look at <strong>necessity</strong> in german the actual word that hegel is using which is <strong>Notwendigkeit</strong>. that&rsquo;s an interesting term it&rsquo;s a perfectly common german word and it is linguistically composed of three elements the first one is <strong>Not</strong> and <strong>Not</strong> is the same etymologically shares the same etymological root with the english word <strong>need</strong> so it refers to a kind of a moment of need where you&rsquo;re in need of help like a moment of crisis or more precisely an emergency. Now the second element of Notwendigkeit is <strong>wendig</strong> and <strong>wendig</strong> means to turn around to change and. the third element is <strong>Keit</strong> which is just the suffix for nouns so it&rsquo;s like <strong>-ity</strong>.</p><p>in english so if we put all these three elements together, Notwendigkeit something like an existential state of being in need of something that brings about a critical or crucial turnaround so that you&rsquo;re no longer in need, so that the emergency is resolved. so in this sense we can also understand and might even translate Notwendigkeit in hegel&rsquo;s usage as:</p><a href=#critical><h3 id=critical><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Critical</h3></a><p>&mldr;so, understanding necessity rather than contingency of something in this sense means to understand why something was critical in a given situation. and this is another way of understanding hegel&rsquo;s project in the phenomenology of spirit - <em>understanding what is critical, understanding how every moment of the life of the whole is somehow equally critical element of moment of the life of the whole</em>. so what hegel does in the phenomenology of spirit is reconstructing the history of the spirit of humankind, so that the critical significance of basically every critical moment in history is understood. so similarly for an individual this would mean to understand the critical significance of every moment in your own individual development that necessarily contributed to the person you are right now.</p><blockquote><p>whatever, it was critical that you studied philosophy. of course you could have studied something else all other contingencies would have been open at the moment. but you studied philosophy and that you decided to study philosophy was critical for becoming the person that you are right now. and you can do this with every other single moment of your life. whatever, again referring to Zizek, it was critical that you fell in love with this person at that time there was a certain need for this that was then resolved precisely through falling in love with that person at that time. of course you could have also met someone else but then meeting this other person would have been an equally necessary moment of what actually took place and made you into the person that you are now.</p></blockquote><p>and in the same way it is even though you could have now been watching a totally different video and not watch this video or do something altogether different and not watch any video at all after you have watched this video, watching this video will also be a critical moment in your life that made you into the person that you are after watching this video. also watching this video will change your self-building in a specific way. and if you want to have a complete understanding of yourself after watching this video you need to understand why in which way watching this video was a critical experience for you.</p><a href=#how-marx-transforms-hegel><h2 id=how-marx-transforms-hegel><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>How Marx Transforms Hegel</h2></a><a href=#necessity-in-marx><h3 id=necessity-in-marx><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Necessity in Marx</h3></a><p>now let&rsquo;s move on from hegel to marx with this concept of necessity in mind. now what marx takes from hegel is a lot of things</p><p>first of all it&rsquo;s philosophy as the systematic science. marx too regards himself first and foremost as a scientist, and <strong>science for hegel and marx means a sort of reconstruction of what is ecessary for the dynamic or organic development not of the human mind but for marks of human society</strong> and equally what marx takes from hegel is to look at this development by no means as a merely passive process but, and i talked about this in the first video, as rather than having experience making experiences. so <strong>crucial for this process of social development is subjective engagement with the objective world and with other subjects which transforms both the objects that you engage with and the subjects that you engage with AND yourself through this engagement</strong>.</p><p>so like for hegel for marx development is first and foremost to use the hegelian term <em>buildung</em> - building/production and it is first and foremost building oneself through what one builds, through building relationships. so reality is activity. it&rsquo;s somehow how we work in actuality. and like for hegel what is crucial for marx in the context of this process is the function of negation, so <strong>building or producing something also involves the destruction of what was before not only objectively but also subjectively</strong>. you destroy certain objects in order to build other objects and by destroying certain objects to build other objects you also build yourself and thereby somehow destroy your former self and build your future self. so there&rsquo;s a growth process here, and this growth process, like with hegel also for marx, includes an increase of productivity - you become more and more productive, you become at the same time also more and more subjective and you become more and more in control or to use the core enlightenment term you <em>mature</em> right so there is a process of development the process of growth is also a process of maturation and this means that you become less and less dependent and more and more independent.</p><a href=#bildung-buildingproduction><h3 id=bildung-buildingproduction><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>&ldquo;Bildung&rdquo; (building/production)</h3></a><p>now importantly of course when we get to marx there is a decisive shift from hegel&rsquo;s idealism to marx materialism but this shift as radical as it seems and actually is is already very much implied in hegel&rsquo;s own language. basically what marx does he simply takes hegel by the words he use like going back to the notion of bildung, building as production. hegel very often talks of it and he uses the term, somewhat metaphorically, of building as <strong>arbite as labor</strong> of work that&rsquo;s working. so for marx simply the activity of the spirit that the working of the spirit the labor of the spirit that hegel talks about becomes actual physical material labor</p><p>so for marx, <strong>human activity is seen first and foremost as labor but no longer in spiritual sense but in a material sense</strong> . so, simply put for marx: material production, material building is more foundational than spiritual productivity, spiritual building. and there are two famous quotes by marx one in the <code>preface to contribution to the critique of political economy</code> where he says not quite literally but more or less in these words that</p><blockquote><p>social being determines that which is conscious.</p></blockquote><p>so social being determines conscious being. and that&rsquo;s very famous and maybe even more famous is a passage from the <code>afterward to das capital</code> where marx basically alludes that (doesn&rsquo;t say it in exactly these words) that:</p><blockquote><p>he&rsquo;s turning Hegle from his head to his feet</p></blockquote><p>and again of course hegel is always talking about the head of consciousness but marx is basing everything on the earthly ground on actual physical activity so again what marx does is <strong>he regards human productivity and the dialectical process that structures human productivity consists primarily in material and not in spiritual practice</strong>, in labor, in the economy and how we labor and how the economy works. this then somehow determines how we think and how the spirit evolves, so basically what marx does he replaces a phenomenology of spirit with a phenomenology of labor with economics. he&rsquo;s an economic scientist and not a scientist of spirit.</p><p>let&rsquo;s now turn to what i think is a widespread and there&rsquo;s been a lot of discussion on this <em>misreading of marx</em> that is in our times represented by jordan peterson. namely what i would like to call a moralist misreading of marx so simply put in jordan peterson reading (and again he&rsquo;s basically just reformulating positions) that were already brought up by others before: marx is all about making a distinction between the oppressor and the oppressed and then the point is to liberate the oppressed because being oppressed is bad and it&rsquo;s morally bad.</p><p>and so it&rsquo;s kind of a moral demand that those who are oppressed need to be liberated. now crucially i think for marx simply <em>being oppressed or somehow being low in society does not really make someone or a group or class progressive or productive</em> for instance below the proletariat there is famously or infamously for marx and what he calls the <em>lumpenproletariat</em> that&rsquo;s an interesting word it refers to those below the workers the bums so to speak people half criminals or so who don&rsquo;t really have a job who you know just kind
of vagabonds or something like this and the term lumpenproletariat again has like a double meaning lumpin on the one hand means rags so people who don&rsquo;t have proper clothing and on the other hand lum also means a villain a bad guy. <strong>so the lumpenproletariat is for marx actually not at all a class that is progressive or a class that has any revolutionary.</strong></p><p>potential to the country marx is very kind of negative about the proletariat and uses there for a very negative term, so it&rsquo;s not about for marx to really focus on liberating anyone who is low or who is oppressed. <strong>what class struggle means is that the actually building class the actual working class the productive class needs to gain agency and needs to gain control needs to mature.</strong></p><p>now it also very importantly through this process needs to gain self-consciousness of its labor and of its progressive function in society,and again this is for marx and now we get back to the concept of necessity. a necessary event in order to move history forward it is necessary, and as we explained earlier, at the same time a critical so such a necessary and critical function is not ascribed to anyone or any class that is being oppressed but only to that class which is actually the building or the productive class. <strong>and the consequence of this productive class gaining power is supposed to be an increase in productivity</strong>. it&rsquo;s not just a mere moralist liberation but it is that which moves history forward which brings the process of of social evolution to a higher stage and therefore necessarily results in increased productivity and increased subjectivity in increased maturity, in increased independence and (again of course all this comes from hegel) this is based on the labor of the negative there is necessarily a moment of revolution involved in this because that which has been and has to be sublated has to be alpha home with something that represents a higher stage in the development of the whole.</p><a href=#morally-judging-capitalists><h3 id=morally-judging-capitalists><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Morally Judging Capitalists</h3></a><p>so marx highlights development, highlights productivity, highlights progress. i want to just quote one sentence here from my favorite contemporary theorist social theorist nicholas luman from his work <code>theory of society </code>where he writes:</p><blockquote><p>Marx social critique managed to avoid morally judging capitalists</p></blockquote><p>and i agree with that statement. there are many people who disagree with it, but i agree with this assessment. and people who disagree with this assessment probably also <em>people like jordan peterson who imply that marxism and the communist manifesto is about the violent promotion of something like social justice of equality of eliminating the oppressor-oppressed distinction, however disconnected from class struggle, disconnected from this kind of increase in productivity and the building of the productive class, which includes itself building notions such as social justice and equality do not really make sense for marx.</em></p><p>so of course and this is important to highlight <strong>marx is not against justice and equality</strong> that would be absurd but again these moral categories on their own are quite meaningless for marx if they are not understood in the socio-economic and historical context. <strong>so in short marx was not a social justice warrior</strong>, nor a christian nor an american independence fighter.</p><blockquote><p>marxism is not primarily about sympathy with anyone who is somehow weak or oppressed or lacks independence but about understanding the necessary rise of the productive forces in society.</p></blockquote><p>but there&rsquo;s also sort of an existential necessity in marx in the sense that it is for marx very important to understand the critical significance of actual historical events. so marx commented a lot and very in very much detail on the historical events of his time whatever the uprisings in 1848 and so forth of his time in order to identify in which way these events represent necessary critical turning points in history, he wanted to understand to reconstruct what these seemingly contingent events meant in the context of the necessary development of society and productivity that would move history forward.</p><p>marx like Engels aimed at transforming contingency into necessity and in that very sense he also claimed to be a scientist but again not a scientist of the spirit but a social scientist if and how this science was successful is of course a completely different matter and i&rsquo;m not going to discuss this in this video</p><a href=#how-nietzsche-transforms-hegel><h2 id=how-nietzsche-transforms-hegel><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>How Nietzsche Transforms Hegel</h2></a><p>now let&rsquo;s move on to nietzsche and post-modernism. i think it&rsquo;s pretty clear as many people have pointed out that nietzsche is a predecessor of post-modernism that he&rsquo;s a pre-post-modernist .nevertheless nietzsche takes from hegel is like marx historical approach to a certain extent. nietzsche says for instance <em>without hegel, no darwin</em> it says it&rsquo;s for instance in the <code>gay science</code> by the way a gay science could also in german it&rsquo;s the freudenschaft could also be translated to use an old english word which is the same etymologically as the word <em>foolish</em>. in german something like <code>frolicking science</code> nietzsche points out that without hegel there is no darwin, and of course nietzsche also very much focused on history on development, on evolution, and then formulated his own <em>genealogical approach</em> famously in the <code>genealogy of morality </code>.</p><p>there is also this kind of scientific historical genealogical aspect to nature but at the same time nature science and this is the point i want to make is very different from hegel&rsquo;s notion of science. Hegel&rsquo;s notion of science like marx is very much a modern notion of science but <strong>with nietzsche we get to a postmodern notion of science</strong>, a kind of an ironic science in <code>the gay science</code> and the preface that he talks about a great suspicion that underlies that informs nietzsche&rsquo;s approach. he even talks about in the same book uses the expression the incipit parodia/The parody begins. parody begins and this kind of almost ironic transformation of a modern science as we find it in hegel and marx into a gay or frolicking science as we find it in nietzsche i think consists precisely in <strong>the transformation of the central task for hegel and marx, which was transforming contingency into necessity. instead of this nietzsche turns this around and instead his frolicking sciences ironic science transforms that which seems necessary into that which we now understand as being contingent</strong>. and just to give a few quotes from the gay science what nietzsche looks at i&rsquo;m quoting here:</p><blockquote><p>the unconscious disguise of physiological needs in the coat of the objective the ideal the purely spiritual</p></blockquote><p>so purely spiritual of course also alludes to hegel and the objective. and the ideal alludes to kind of a modern notion of science so what nietzsche says here that these are just disguises the objective the ideal the purely spiritual and what they disguise is certain elements that are unconscious that are physiological, and that we somehow cover up with the pseudo objectivity.</p><p>another quote is:</p><blockquote><p>all philosophizing so far was not about truth but about something else let&rsquo;s say about health, future, growth, power, life</p></blockquote><p>so again the scientific focus on truth as that which is necessary true is replaced in nietzsche by saying no the truth <strong>the so-called truth only reveals certain drives certain instincts a certain form of looking for health, of looking for future, looking for growth of expressing power of living</strong>. and he also says</p><blockquote><p>we no longer relish this bad taste, this desire for truth. we are too experienced, too serious, too joyful.</p></blockquote><p>so this quote brings again combines a lot of elements so again the desire for truth is now regarded this kind of modern scientific desire for truth. is is regarded as somehow a bad taste we are too experienced to take this old form of experience as sufficient, we are too serious and too joyful on the one hand we&rsquo;re very serious about the things that inform the desire for truth, but we&rsquo;re also somehow too joyful to really regard this kind of very insipid objective a true search as the whole truth.</p><p>what nietzsche does not only in the gay science but also especially in his later works is that <strong>he reveals the historical, or we may now say cultural, the bodily or we say physiological, the mental or we may say the psychological, the linguistic the ideological or religious contingencies that then philosophy covers up as, or disguises, as objective truth right so objective truths are by no means objective truth but they are contingent on historical events on bodily desires</strong> , on certain mental or psychological needs, on the language that we use on the ideologies that have taken hold of us, or on religious whatever fantasies that we have taken on.</p><p>so and these are all contingencies that then lead us to construct something like objective truth in order to somehow cover up these contingencies, and nietzsche&rsquo;s post-modern science then again re covers this covers these covered up contingencies. <strong>so in this sense objective truth is revealed as something that is a construct which hides something that is much more complex underneath</strong>. in order to give a concrete example i want to return to a section from the twilight of the idols in the four great eras that i also addressed in a previous video and talk about the error of false causality and here nietzsche writes:</p><blockquote><p>The conception of consciousness spirit as cause, and ,still later, of the eye which is the subject as cause. (&mldr;)
Today we no longer believe a single word of all of this (&mldr;)
And the I! it has become a fable fiction a pun, there are no spiritual causes (&mldr;)
The error of the spirit as cause was mistaken for reality</p></blockquote><p>now of course all of this language of the spirit alludes to hegel, and likewise the notion of the i and the subject. so <strong>for nietzsche these concepts central for hegel spirit and subjectivity do not indicate causes they have no necessity</strong>. to the contrary they are contingent upon physiological psychological, historical, linguistic circumstances that could have been otherwise. so precisely this quote shows how that which is deemed to be necessary is actually not necessary but contingent so the error of false causality also implies an error of false necessitty.</p><a href=#false-causality><h3 id=false-causality><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>False Causality</h3></a><p>because of a double meaning of contingency - contingency means of course contingent upon - but <strong>if spirit and subject are not causes then they are effects and thereby contingent upon something else</strong>. and this at the same time also means of course that other options would have been and are possible nothing is necessary everything is somehow coincidental.</p><a href=#conclusion><h2 id=conclusion><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Conclusion</h2></a><p>to sum up the conversions of hegel</p><ul><li>both marx and nature continue hegel&rsquo;s dynamic historical evolutionary approach</li><li>however Marx turns Hegel&rsquo;s science of the experience of the spirit into a science of the experience of material production.</li><li>nietzsche turns hegel&rsquo;s philosophical transformation of contingency into necessity,into a philosophical transformation of necessity, into contingency. it&rsquo;s a kind of a serious parody of the former philosophical science and thereby we end up with a joyful science</li></ul><p>i might do another video on nietzsche in the future to explain these things and other things in more detail thank you for watching/reading</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://potatomat0.github.io/obsidian-public-vault/js/graph.6579af7b10c818dbd2ca038702db0224.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Nhat Hoang Â© 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://potatomat0.github.io/obsidian-public-vault/>Home</a></li><li><a href=http://nhatkothieunang.web.app/>Other hobby links</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/potatomat0/obsidian-public-vault>GitHub</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
