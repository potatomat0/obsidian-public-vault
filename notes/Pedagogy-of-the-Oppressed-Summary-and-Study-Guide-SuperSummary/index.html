Born in 1921, Freire grew up in the northeast of Brazil, where he often came in contact with the poverty that plagued Latin America during the Great Depression. After studying law, he began his career teaching Portuguese in secondary schools. In 1944 he married Elza Oliveira, a primary school teacher who encouraged him to develop his theories on education, and the two had five children together. Freire spent much of the 1950s and 60s implementing literacy programs for poor people in Brazil, often with the support of the Brazilian government, and this work directly informs Freire’s writings. These programs often experimented with their methods, and they saw success in raising Brazil’s literacy rates. In 1964, Brazil’s president was ousted in a coup d’état and replaced by a military government, which found Freire’s programs too subversive. Friere was imprisoned for more than two months as a traitor and exiled soon after. After a short stay in Bolivia, he worked in Chile for five years, where he published Education as the Practice of Freedom (1967) and Pedagogy of the Oppressed (1968). Both books were well received in the academic community, and Freire spent much of the late 1960s and 1970s as a Harvard lecturer and a consultant for the United Nations. After more than a decade in exile, Freire returned to Brazil in 1980 and joined the Worker’s Party. He continued his educational practice late in life, and was eventually appointed Secretary of Education in Sao Paolo. He died in 1997.</p><a href=#historical-context-of_pedagogy-of-the-oppressed_><h2 id=historical-context-of_pedagogy-of-the-oppressed_><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Historical Context of <em>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</em></h2></a><p>During the Cold War, Latin America experienced great political upheaval, as the competing interests of the capitalist United States and the communist Soviet Union fractured the globe. Military coups occurred in Bolivia, Brazil, Argentina, and other South American countries in the 1960s and 1970s, sometimes backed by the United States, and the new authoritarian governments in these countries were often explicitly opposed to communist ideas. Brazil’s coup, in particular, impacted Freire’s perspective in his writings: military leaders ousted left-leaning president João Goulart in 1964 and began to purge the government of programs and people deemed too radical (including Freire and his literacy efforts). It’s within this context that Freire writes Pedagogy of the Oppressed: exiled from his native country as it experienced an anti-communist regime change, Freire’s ground-up approach to education critiques the rise of authoritarianism and right-wing policies in Latin America at that time. In contrast, Freire lived in Chile while writing the book, which had begun to implement land and education reform under president Eduardo Frei Montlava. By 1973, five years after the publication of Pedagogy of the Oppressed, Chile was struck by its own US-backed coup.</p><a href=#other-books-related-to_pedagogy-of-the-oppressed_><h2 id=other-books-related-to_pedagogy-of-the-oppressed_><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Other Books Related to <em>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</em></h2></a><p>Freire’s work, which is concerned with political and economic inequality, is in the Marxist philosophical tradition. In Pedagogy of the Oppressed, he quotes several essays and letters of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, whose work promotes a materialist view of history and critiques the structure of Western capitalism. In some places, like his discussion of dialectics, Freire invokes Marx and Engel’s influences, like Georg Hegel’s The Phenomenology of Mind (1807)—a wide-spanning theoretical text about human consciousness and knowledge. Freire also draws from the writings of leftist thinkers and revolutionaries who followed them, like Vladimir Lenin’s political pamphlet “What Is To Be Done?” (1902), Frantz Fanon’s 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/the-wretched-of-the-earth rel=noopener>The Wretched of the Earth</a> (1961), and The Diary of Che Guevara (1968). Fanon and Guevara, who respectively worked in Africa and Latin America, are particularly important because both explicitly sought to challenge European and American colonialism. Although Pedagogy of the Oppressed is his most famous book, Freire wrote several other texts expanding on his educational approach, including Education as the Practice of Freedom (1967), Education for Critical Consciousness (1973), and The Politics of Education (1985).</p><a href=#key-facts-about_pedagogy-of-the-oppressed_><h2 id=key-facts-about_pedagogy-of-the-oppressed_><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Key Facts about <em>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</em></h2></a><ul><li>Full Title: Pedagogy of the Oppressed (Pedagogia do Oprimido)</li><li>When Written: 1967-68</li><li>Where Written: Santiago, Chile</li><li>When Published: 1968 (Portuguese), 1970 (English)</li><li>Literary Period: Postcolonial Latin American literature</li><li>Genre: Education Philosophy</li><li>Setting: Cold War Brazil and Chile</li><li>Climax: Freire boils down human existence to a process of dialogue, through which people turn thoughts and words into action: “To exist, humanly, is to name the world, to change it.”</li><li>Antagonist: Oppressive societies and the oppressors within those societies.</li><li>Point of View: Third-person, though Freire occasionally uses the first-person.</li></ul><a href=#extra-credit-for_pedagogy-of-the-oppressed_><h2 id=extra-credit-for_pedagogy-of-the-oppressed_><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Extra Credit for <em>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</em></h2></a><p>Bad Timing. When Freire was exiled by Brazil’s military coup in 1964, he was first granted asylum in Bolivia. But he wouldn’t stay for long: less than a month after Freire arrived, Bolivia was also struck by a military coup.</p><p>Delayed Reception. Although Pedagogy of the Oppressed was first published in Portuguese in 1968, it did not appear on bookshelves in Brazil until 1974, when a new Brazilian president began to relax the government’s stance toward political opponents. In fact, it was published in both English and Spanish first, receiving wide acclaim outside of Freire’s homeland.</p><a href=#book-summary><h1 id=book-summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Book summary</h1></a><a href=#a-brief-summary><h2 id=a-brief-summary><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>A brief summary</h2></a><p>Paolo Freire’s <em>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</em> develops a theory of education fitted to the needs of the disenfranchised and marginalized members of capitalist societies. Combining educational and political philosophy, the book offers an analysis of oppression and a theory of liberation. Freire believes that traditional education serves to support the dominance of the powerful within society and thereby maintain the powerful’s social, political, and economic <em>status quo</em>. To overcome the oppression endemic to an exploitative society, education must be remade to inspire and enable the oppressed in their struggle for liberation. This new
<a href=https://www.supersummary.com/style/ rel=noopener>style</a> of education focuses on consciousness-raising, dialogue, and collaboration between teacher and student in the effort to achieve greater humanization for all.</p><p>For Freire, education is political and functions either to preserve the current social order or to transform it. The theories of education and revolutionary action he offers in <em>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</em> are addressed to a radical
<a href=https://www.supersummary.com/audience/ rel=noopener>audience</a> committed to the struggle for liberation from oppression. Freire’s own commitment to this struggle developed through years of teaching literacy to Brazilian and Chilean peasants and laborers. His efforts at educational and political reform resulted in a brief period of imprisonment followed exile from his native Brazil for fifteen years.</p><p><em>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</em> begins with a preface in which Freire asserts the importance of consciousness-raising, or <em>conscientização</em>, as the means enabling the oppressed to recognize their oppression and commit to the effort to overcome it, taking full responsibility for themselves in the struggle for liberation. He addresses the “fear of freedom,” which inhibits the oppressed from assuming this responsibility. He also cautions against the dangers of sectarianism, which can undermine the revolutionary purpose as well as serve as a refuge for the committed conservative.</p><p>The struggle for liberation is a struggle to reclaim our humanity. By objectifying and debilitating the oppressed, oppression dehumanizes them as well as their oppressor. Conditioned by oppression to mistrust and undervalue themselves, the oppressed languish, submerged in the concrete reality of their oppression, thereby developing a false consciousness that is politically immobilizing.</p><p>Freire claims, however, that humanization is the vocation of human beings. We are challenged to fully develop our humanity and this entails the exercise of free will in creating ourselves and transforming the world through our labor. The historical task of the oppressed is to liberate themselves and their oppressors by becoming subjects in the historical process and surmounting the social institution of domination. The pedagogy of the oppressed, therefore, aims to overcome the false consciousness of the dispossessed by penetrating the “culture of silence” that afflicts them, and unveiling the structures and causes of oppression.</p><p>Freire attacks traditional education, which he calls the “banking” method. In this form of education, the teacher “deposits” information in the student, who serves as a passive receptacle for knowledge. A strict hierarchy prevails between the authoritarian teacher who possesses knowledge and the receptive student who is presumed by the educational system to be ignorant. By denying creativity and agency to the student, this type of education serves to disempower and indoctrinate the student in the ideology of the dominant elite, adapting her to the oppressive social order.</p><p><a href=https://www.supersummary.com/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/symbols-and-motifs/#50874 rel=noopener>Problem-posing education</a>, by contrast, encourages students to think and collaborate with their teachers in the process of acquiring knowledge. A humanist form of education, it relies on dialogue, which requires love, humility, faith, and hope, and results in the mutual trust of educator and student. These qualities enable problem-posing education to be an instrument of social transformation. The task of the educator is to facilitate the development of critical awareness among the oppressed, focusing on the concrete conditions of their existence and posing these as problems to the students. In dialogue, teacher and students share in the act of creating knowledge in which each teaches the other. This process of education leads to the development of the revolutionary
<a href=https://www.supersummary.com/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/symbols-and-motifs/#50877 rel=noopener>praxis</a> of the oppressed, in which critical reflection and liberatory action cooperate and influence each other in the emancipatory struggle.</p><p>Freire provides an example of how teachers can undertake problem-posing education with a group of people. Observing the population from a sociological and anthropological viewpoint, educators work with the people to identify “themes” that reflect the conditions of their existence—their hopes, beliefs, fears, and challenges. These themes are re-presented to the group in codified form, using pictures, films, audio recordings and other media to stimulate discussion of their significance. The aim is to enable the public to discover the relation of these themes as dimensions of a larger totality of oppression, and recognize the contradictions underlying the social structure of domination.</p><p>Freire concludes by offering a theory of revolutionary action that counters the oppressor’s cultural tactics to preserve his dominance. The oppressor attempts to dominate the oppressed through conquest, division, manipulation and cultural invasion. The revolutionary responds to these “antidialogical” forms of action with “dialogical” forms: cooperation, unification, organization, and cultural synthesis, all of which reflect the communion of the revolutionary leadership with the oppressed in the joint struggle for liberation.</p><a href=#chapter-1><h2 id=chapter-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 1</h2></a><p>At the start of the chapter,

Though both humanization and dehumanization are possible for all people, people naturally strive to become more humanized, a process that is constantly undermined by “injustice, exploitation, and…violence.”  Dehumanization is not our destiny as people, but rather the product of an unfair social order. Because of this, the most important task of oppressed people is to

<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/the-oppressor rel=noopener>oppressors</a>) from an unjust system. When oppressors appear to help oppressed people, Freire argues that they often harbor a “false generosity” that relies on oppression to work. To truly help oppressed people, one must join the struggle to destroy oppression entirely.</p><p>Freire grounds his approach to Pedagogy of the Oppressed in how we understand ourselves as human beings: he directly links liberation with human identity, and oppression with a damaged sense of self. There is a constant tension between people struggling to become themselves, and an enemy who actively hinders them. Oppressors are standing in the way of what human beings naturally want out of life. It’s worth noting that this idea of oppressors having false generosity is a somewhat severe viewpoint—he assumes that most people who try to help oppressed people do so in bad faith, rather than trying to help earnestly but not knowing the best way to do it.

Freire asserts that an oppressive system shapes the attitudes of oppressed people, and makes them believe that they should become just like oppressors. This means that oppressed people do not always see themselves as “oppressed” at first, holding onto the “fear of 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/d487450e-aa7a-4100-b4d9-93e6af0b9b71 rel=noopener>freedom</a>” mentioned in the Preface. Freire boils down the oppressor/oppressed relationship to one of “prescription”: oppressed people behave in ways prescribed to them by their oppressors. Freire suggests that oppressed people fear freedom because it requires them to reject these internalized ideals and behaviors. Nevertheless, freedom is a constant goal for all people, “the indispensible condition” for feeling complete as a person.</p><p>Freire continually stresses the need for oppressed people to lead their own struggle for freedom. However, oppressed people have to first shift from their traditional ideas of how to live—ideas that are based in the hierarchical system of oppression. Since oppressed people learn that this hierarchy is the natural and moral way to organize society, they may have to relearn long-held beliefs and attitudes toward society and each other. As his discussion of sectarianism points out, Freire argues that non-oppressors can hinder their struggle for freedom when they hold on to the values and methods of the oppressors.</p><p>To overcome

<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/the-oppressed rel=noopener>the oppressed</a>”: to help the oppressed critically examine the nature of oppression, and take action to change their conditions. This pedagogy should also be led, at least in part, by oppressed people, so that they play an active role in their own 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/726418a8-2e2e-4c98-b880-8e1322c50636 rel=noopener>liberation</a>. Beginning the struggle for liberation in this way is difficult, for both oppressed people and 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/the-oppressor rel=noopener>oppressors</a> who become aware of their problematic role in society. But Freire argues that the concrete work of helping people become free is a vital way to overcome these challenges.</p><p>Education, to Freire, has the potential to be a tool for human transformation. But this requires us to consider what education could look like if we remodeled it to specifically address the needs of oppressed people, instead of serving the interests of oppressors. Freire’s use of the term “pedagogy of the oppressed” points to this theoretical question, which ultimately guides much of the text.</p><p>The results of 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/726418a8-2e2e-4c98-b880-8e1322c50636 rel=noopener>liberation</a> should be twofold (and, to

Both are necessary because Freire sees the relationship between people and the world as interconnected: human action has created our society, and human action can change it for the future. These changes can only occur through “
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/b2610d27-8e32-44ae-974d-50cbe9826a00 rel=noopener>praxis</a>,” the combination of reflection and action aimed at transforming the world. When only one occurs, true liberation is not possible. Freire points out that 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/the-oppressor rel=noopener>oppressors</a> use a variety of techniques to dissuade 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/the-oppressed rel=noopener>oppressed people</a> from critical reflection: if oppressed people realize that they live in an oppressive system, more will be spurred to take action against it. For this reason, a

In Chapter 3, Freire goes into more detail about the relationship between human beings and the world, in his discussions of history and dialogue. Oppressors have a vested interest in keeping human action separate from the world of oppression, so that oppressed people cannot remove the oppressors from power.</p><p>&ldquo;My students can&rsquo;t get enough of your charts and their results have gone through the roof.&rdquo; -Graham S.</p><p>A 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/37bc5b1c-15c4-46f5-9de9-0a9f84edaa45 rel=noopener>pedagogy</a> of

<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/paulo-freire rel=noopener>Freire</a>, is designed to help people regain their humanity. A pedagogy led by 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/the-oppressor rel=noopener>oppressors</a>, like traditional Western education, cannot truly help oppressed people because it is a product of the oppressive system that must be overthrown. All the same, only the oppressors have the political power to implement a pedagogy on a large scale—which is why Freire recommends using smaller “educational projects” to introduce liberating ideas to the people. More broadly, Freire sees his pedagogy in two stages. In the first stage, oppressed people become aware of their status as “oppressed people,” and commit to changing their conditions. When the oppressed have succeeded in freeing themselves, the second stage expands the pedagogy’s scope to include all people—not just the oppressed.</p><p>Much of Freire’s work is based on the smaller “educational projects” he conducted in South America. Importantly, Freire emphasizes the inadequacy of traditional education in helping oppressed people achieve freedom, and he sees his theories as a necessary counterpoint to that tradition. The text primarily focuses on the first stage of Freire’s pedagogy, though—he spends much more time going into what his pedagogy should look like because we have not reached the second stage yet.</p><p>A key part of the first stage of 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/paulo-freire rel=noopener>Freire</a>’s 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/37bc5b1c-15c4-46f5-9de9-0a9f84edaa45 rel=noopener>pedagogy</a> involves understanding the consciousnesses of 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/the-oppressor rel=noopener>oppressors</a> and 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/the-oppressed rel=noopener>oppressed people</a>, and especially the inner conflicts of oppressed people. Freire defines 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/726418a8-2e2e-4c98-b880-8e1322c50636 rel=noopener>oppression</a> as an act of exploitation, violence, and a failure “to recognize others as persons.” Not only do oppressors commit violence against the oppressed by keeping them from being fully human, they often stereotype oppressed people as “violent” for responding to oppression. Because of this, the struggle of 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/726418a8-2e2e-4c98-b880-8e1322c50636 rel=noopener>liberation</a> is an act of love, an attempt to restore the humanity of all people. True liberation does not only remove oppressors from power, but also creates a society in which the role of “oppressor” does not exist—which will feel like a kind of oppression to them.</p><p>Freire points out several contradictions between oppressed people’s lived experience and how oppressors talk about them. For example, oppressed people are stereotyped as “violent,” when Freire would say they are responding to violence that comes from society. In contrast to this, he characterizes liberation (and working with oppressed people) as a loving act that directly combats violence.</p><p><a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/paulo-freire rel=noopener>Freire</a> then examines the 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/the-oppressor rel=noopener>oppressor</a> consciousness in greater detail. More than anything, oppressors prioritize “their right to live in peace”—but concede that they also depend on 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/the-oppressed rel=noopener>oppressed people</a>’s existence to hold power. Oppressors have a “materialistic” view toward their lives: through 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/726418a8-2e2e-4c98-b880-8e1322c50636 rel=noopener>oppression</a>, they attempt to transform the world, people, and time into objects that can be owned. And because oppressors feel that they can own humanity, they see the fight for 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/eca1109e-2274-4059-b14c-4ff827804cdd rel=noopener>humanization</a> and

Oppressors also rely on controlling others, to the point that Freire calls them “necrophilic” or life-killing. Freire acknowledges that oppressors can join the fight for 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/726418a8-2e2e-4c98-b880-8e1322c50636 rel=noopener>liberation</a> with oppressed people, but he argues that the oppressors often bring oppressive beliefs and perspectives with them. These converts can also practice “false generosity,” that relies on oppression to be meaningful.</p><p>One potentially contentious part of Freire’s argument is that oppressed people have to liberate their oppressors while liberating themselves. Freire explains this by analyzing the oppressors’ values: since oppressors are opposed to freedom and humanization, they try to prevent everyone from achieving those goals. An oppressor can only affirm their humanity outside of the oppressive system that keeps them in control. Freire also argues that control, in this context, is an act of violence that stifles human life.</p><p>People who commit themselves to human 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/726418a8-2e2e-4c98-b880-8e1322c50636 rel=noopener>liberation</a> should constantly reflect on their preexisting beliefs and biases. To authentically achieve 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/d487450e-aa7a-4100-b4d9-93e6af0b9b71 rel=noopener>freedom</a>, a convert should be able to work with 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/the-oppressed rel=noopener>oppressed people</a>, without seeing them as ignorant or untrustworthy. He or she should also examine how oppressed people think, in order to see where the oppressive system affects their perspective. For example, 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/paulo-freire rel=noopener>Freire</a> suggests that oppressed people sometimes take on a “fatalistic” view towards their circumstances, because they have been taught that their misfortunes are the product of things out of their control (like God, or fate). Freire continues to detail the oppressed consciousness, noting that oppressed people often feel alienated from society and undervalue themselves. An effective “
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/37bc5b1c-15c4-46f5-9de9-0a9f84edaa45 rel=noopener>pedagogy</a> of the oppressed” should rely on the knowledge and experiences of oppressed people, even if those people are not initially confident in their abilities or value.</p><p>Freire is clearly against fatalism, and he connects it to ideas about religion and destiny. He doesn’t seem to oppose religion or spirituality, but he suggests that the fatalistic aspects of some religions help the oppressors. Oppressors, of course, also rely on fatalism to convince oppressed people that the future cannot change. Nonetheless, these beliefs can be changed with an effective educational system, even among oppressors. Freire argues that we must take these deep-seated beliefs into account as we present a new, and radical, vision of what the world is.</p><p>According to 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/paulo-freire rel=noopener>Freire</a>, 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/the-oppressed rel=noopener>oppressed people</a> can begin to gain confidence and conviction when they learn about the causes of 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/726418a8-2e2e-4c98-b880-8e1322c50636 rel=noopener>oppression</a>, and see that their 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/the-oppressor rel=noopener>oppressors</a> can be vulnerable. A key part of 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/726418a8-2e2e-4c98-b880-8e1322c50636 rel=noopener>liberation</a> is this movement from passive acceptance to active participation in the struggle. Along the way, the oppressed should enter into 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/f79289d1-0e54-407f-a954-ff4392fe94a1 rel=noopener>dialogue</a> with others to push for

Freire argues that political leaders should approach liberation in a “
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/37bc5b1c-15c4-46f5-9de9-0a9f84edaa45 rel=noopener>pedagogical</a>” way, since educational methods can be used to shift how oppressed people think. However, if this is not done in dialogue with the oppressed, it can resemble propaganda. Leaders and the people must take on the task of reflection and action together.</p><p>Another key concept Freire introduces in this chapter is dialogue: dialogue is the opposite of hierarchy, a shift from superiority (and, by extension, inferiority) to equality. Because the struggle for freedom can only succeed if it’s based on dialogue, education should be the same way. These connections between education and revolution become more vital as the book proceeds and Freire describes the methods needed for effective social change. People can struggle for freedom without using dialogue, which leads to a movement that is incomplete and inadequate.</p><a href=#chapter-2><h2 id=chapter-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 2</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/paulo-freire rel=noopener>Freire</a> begins Chapter 2 by describing the characteristics of a traditional Western classroom. He focuses on its “narrative” aspects: the teacher is a “narrating Subject” with students who are passive. The teacher’s narration—or the facts that he/she is teaching—is disconnected from the students’ life experiences, and students memorize these facts without understanding their full meaning or context. Freire calls this the “
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/symbols/banking rel=noopener>banking</a>” model of education, one in which teachers “deposit” knowledge into the minds of their students. He finds this model problematic because it stifles creativity, and does not encourage students to ask new questions through 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/b2610d27-8e32-44ae-974d-50cbe9826a00 rel=noopener>praxis</a>.</p><p>Freire uses the term “narration” to call attention to the one-sided nature of traditional teaching.  In the banking model, students rely on the teacher to tell them which ideas, facts, and perspectives are correct, useful, or relevant to their lives. Freire’s critique of these classrooms—where students memorize and regurgitate facts—can still be seen today in political debates about school curriculums and standardized testing.</p><p>Knowledge, for 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/paulo-freire rel=noopener>Freire</a>, is the result of a constant process of questioning the world. However, the “
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/symbols/banking rel=noopener>banking</a>” model conceives of knowledge as something that teachers have and students lack. This approach is closely tied to

<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/the-oppressed rel=noopener>oppressed people</a> become free, must change the contradictory relationship between teachers and students. In this relationship, teachers have absolute authority and control over their students.</p><p>According to Freire, oppressors often claim that some kinds of knowledge are only possessed by authority figures. From this premise, oppressors can then claim that hierarchies are the best way to organize society—not only governments, but schools and families as well. If only some people have knowledge, then only some people can be in a position to lead others.</p><p>The “
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/symbols/banking rel=noopener>banking</a>” model molds the attitudes of students: it teaches them to adapt to the world as it is, instead of questioning it or trying to change it. This helps

<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/paulo-freire rel=noopener>Freire</a> argues that oppressors combine “banking” education with institutions like welfare, which treats oppressed people as if they exist outside of normal, “healthy” society. To

But Freire urges oppressed people to see traditional society as inherently bad because it marginalizes them. This is why Freire often critiques people who attempt to reform oppressive institutions: to him, reform is ultimately futile because it assumes that those institutions are not oppressive by default.</p><p>Teachers who use the “

<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/the-oppressed rel=noopener>oppressed people</a> cannot wait for this to happen—they should work with oppressed people, as fellow students, to achieve conscientização together. “Banking” education hinders this process through its assumptions about human beings and the world. In the “banking” model, people do not act on the world: they merely live in it and observe it. Teachers, then, control how their students observe the world and teach them to fit in.</p><p>Many people (in this instance, students and teachers) don’t realize that they are oppressed, or an oppressor. This is the result of some oppressors working overtime to disguise the true nature of oppression. However, Freire believes in people’s ability to convert—to find out that they are contributing to an oppressive system, and then commit to changing it. Freire’s pedagogy attempts to make this conversion a key goal of education.</p><p>The methods teachers use in the “
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/symbols/banking rel=noopener>banking</a>” model create distance between them and their students. In contrast, 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/paulo-freire rel=noopener>Freire</a> argues for authentic communication in the classroom: teachers cannot impose their ideas on students, but should instead work with students equally. Just like

He notes that revolutionary leaders often use this model already, but urges them to “reject the banking concept in its entirety” and replace it with a new model: the “problem-posing” model.</p><p>Freire argues that oppressive structures and institutions can never create real, lasting freedom for oppressed people. By uplifting the knowledge and life experiences of oppressed people, revolutionaries can push oppressed people to develop their own ideas for structures and institutions that work for everyone. And as South America was overcome with regime changes during the 1960s, Freire is wary of “revolutions” that simply replace the people in power while maintaining an oppressive hierarchy.

It transforms the relationship between students and teachers, merging them into teacher-students and student-teachers. Everyone in the classroom teaches each other and learns from each other. While the “banking” model consists of active teachers and passive students, the “problem-posing” model makes both groups into “co-investigators” who question reality together. 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/paulo-freire rel=noopener>Freire</a> argues that the “problem-posing” model pushes students to gain critical awareness, because it uses topics and problems that are relevant to the students’ experiences. This, in turn, challenges students to take action and face those problems.</p><p>In the “problem-posing” model, Freire sees the relationship between students and teachers as dialectical. He resolves the differences between active teaching and passive learning by synthesizing them into a single role, where everyone teaches and learns in the same classroom. He also argues that students will naturally take a more active role in their education when it feels relevant to them; as Freire argues in Chapter 3, this active participation is necessary to make the problem-posing model succeed.</p><p>When education is designed to foster 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/d487450e-aa7a-4100-b4d9-93e6af0b9b71 rel=noopener>freedom</a>, it treats human beings and the world as intimately connected. 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/paulo-freire rel=noopener>Freire</a> supplies the example of a peasant student in a Chilean class, who argued that human beings must exist in the world to call it a “world” in the first place—and compares the peasant’s point to French existentialist Jean-Paul Sartre’s idea that human consciousness and the world are interdependent. “Problem-posing” education helps people develop their understanding of the world, so that they see the world as constantly in flux. More broadly, Freire reiterates that “problem-posing” and “banking” have entirely opposite goals. While “banking” separates people from history, “problem-posing” helps its students understand their place in history.</p><p>It’s significant that Freire points out the similarities between the peasant’s point of view and Sartre’s point of view. Although Sartre was an academic and philosopher, the peasant (who would be considered “ignorant” in a traditional classroom) was able to develop a similar idea without reading Sartre’s work. For Freire, this comparison shows how oppressors create a false dichotomy between people who have knowledge and people who don’t.</p><p>In the “problem-posing” model, human beings are incomplete and are working to fully become themselves. This means that education is also an ongoing process, a big difference from the lack of change in the “
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/symbols/banking rel=noopener>banking</a>” model. “Problem-posing” is “revolutionary futurity,” according to

To Freire, human existence ultimately boils down to the process of naming and transforming the world around us, and everyone should be able to start this process. Freire defines dialogue in these terms and he argues that dialogue is necessary for human beings to find 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/d487450e-aa7a-4100-b4d9-93e6af0b9b71 rel=noopener>freedom</a> and meaning in their lives.</p><p>Throughout the book, Freire argues that contemplating the world and taking concrete actions in the world must be linked. It isn’t enough to speak out against oppression: if people do not back up their words by actively fighting oppression, then those words are futile. Freire uses this concept of combined reflection and action in his discussions of liberation, praxis, and dialogue, because it is necessary to his vision of a free society.</p><p>Freire grounds the concrete aspects of his pedagogy in theoretical discussions of things like history, consciousness, and the differences between human beings and animals. While the banking model simply presents facts without contextualizing them, problem-posing education allows oppressed people to connect the big ideas that shape society with their personal experiences. According to Freire, oppressors understand that this connection can threaten their power in the long run: it pushes oppressed people to find new ideas to shape a new society.</p><p>The process of 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/e6f1d447-a874-47dd-bac5-415948d28ebe rel=noopener>thematic</a> investigation starts with the educators, who identify an area to work in and begin to observe it and its residents. 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/paulo-freire rel=noopener>Freire</a> uses the example of an adult education class “in a peasant area with a high percentage of illiteracy.” The educators should observe many different aspects of the peasants’ lives, communicating with them and enlisting them as volunteers. Working as a team, the educators and peasants determine the most important conditions that are affecting the peasants, and then determine if the peasants are aware of the area’s limit-situations and themes. Next, the educators use visual, auditory, or tactile materials to represent the limit-situations and themes—Freire calls these materials “codifications.” The codifications should be simple and relatable to the peasants, but should challenge the peasants to come up with their own analysis. Freire cites a Chilean educator who experimented with “decoding” in his classroom to make his students more critical.</p><p>Freire conceives of a comprehensive process through which educators can enter a place and develop a curriculum that is relevant to that place’s population. Just as oppressed people should be active participants in the classroom, Freire stresses that oppressed people should be active participants in the development of the curriculum, to ensure that it is truly relevant to their lives. He also cites the Chilean educator to show that even his own pedagogy can change over time, or can be improved in concrete ways by different perspectives.</p><p>As the peasants and educators analyze the materials together, they reflect on each situation and their views toward it. Rather than prioritizing their view over the peasants’ view, the educators must allow the peasants to speak freely about how the situations make them feel. 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/paulo-freire rel=noopener>Freire</a> uses the example of a “codification” about alcoholism—while the educator might see it as automatically bad, the peasant might see himself in a person who drinks to cope with an 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/726418a8-2e2e-4c98-b880-8e1322c50636 rel=noopener>oppressive</a> job. Throughout this process, the educators listen and document the responses, and eventually begin to study them to find the themes they discussed earlier. Eventually, the educators use these results to make new class materials, which they present to the peasants as part of a more organized curriculum. This curriculum is a product of the educators’ research, and reflects the topics that the peasants care about most. Most importantly, this curriculum allows the peasants to have authority and to think for themselves.</p><p>Here, Freire concretely shows how problem-posing education can resolve the contradictions between teacher-students and student-teachers. While the educators and peasants have conflicting perspectives on alcoholism, both perspectives are necessary to create a fuller picture of how and why people become alcoholics. If those educators had simply told the peasants that alcoholism is bad, they would have missed the economic anxiety that informs the peasants’ viewpoint. Freire would argue that a one-sided discussion can prevent those peasants from feeling comfortable sharing their authentic perspective.</p><a href=#chapter-4><h2 id=chapter-4><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Chapter 4</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/paulo-freire rel=noopener>Freire</a> spends the final chapter discussing his theory of cultural action, or how people create changes in their culture and society. He starts by reiterating the need for

Otherwise, the struggle will be hollow—Freire says that a “revolution for the people” is equivalent to “a revolution without the people.” A revolution that sees oppressed people as ignorant, or objectifies them, buys into the myths 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/726418a8-2e2e-4c98-b880-8e1322c50636 rel=noopener>oppressors</a> use to keep their power. To Freire, the key to an effective revolution is

Just as he does with educators in previous chapters, Freire creates a critical framework for revolutionaries that establishes right and wrong ways to interact with oppressed people. It’s significant that the two frameworks are incredibly similar: in Freire’s view, education and revolution should use similar methods, because both should have the goal of reaching freedom with the oppressed.</p><p>Conquest. “

<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/the-oppressor rel=noopener>oppressors</a>. The most important aspect of antidialogical action is conquest: oppressors try to control people and the world by conquering and owning them. To prevent any further cultural change, they create myths about the world—such as the idea that 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/726418a8-2e2e-4c98-b880-8e1322c50636 rel=noopener>oppression</a> is permanent and encourages

<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/the-oppressed rel=noopener>oppressed people</a> must adapt to it. These myths are found in everything from religion and economics to education and property. Propaganda and mass media ensure that oppressed people internalize these myths, and cannot have authentic 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/f79289d1-0e54-407f-a954-ff4392fe94a1 rel=noopener>dialogue</a> about the true nature of reality. 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/paulo-freire rel=noopener>Freire</a> then emphasizes again that any oppressive situation is opposed to dialogue.</p><p>Conquest forces people to view the world on the terms of their oppressors, which is why oppressors use mass media and propaganda to spread their views as widely as possible. Of course, mass media can work in the interests of oppressed people, but Freire does not seem to consider this a significant factor. This may be because mass media is most effectively used by people in power—namely, the oppressors. Freire also critiques propaganda in Chapter 1 because it tells oppressed people how to think and hinders their agency.</p><p>Divide and Rule. 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/the-oppressor rel=noopener>Oppressors</a> divide and isolate 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/the-oppressed rel=noopener>oppressed people</a> to prevent them from organizing together for 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/726418a8-2e2e-4c98-b880-8e1322c50636 rel=noopener>liberation</a>. This creates rifts among different groups of oppressed people and discourages them from 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/f79289d1-0e54-407f-a954-ff4392fe94a1 rel=noopener>dialogue</a>. One example 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/paulo-freire rel=noopener>Freire</a> uses is community development projects that separate local communities from each other—when communities cannot see that their problems are related, they are less likely to fight the oppressors’ agenda. Another is the way that governments approach communities by selecting leaders, instead of treating everyone in the group equally. And since oppressed people are already trained to see their oppressors as good, this can alienate community leaders from the people they are supposed to serve. In this context, oppressors use “false generosity” to make the oppressed believe that they are being helped. However, this false generosity relies on conquest to keep the oppressed in need of help.</p><p>Oppressors alienate oppressed people from the oppressor class, and also alienate oppressed people from each other. This process makes it easier for the oppressors to convince the oppressed that hierarchies are the best way to organize society. Hierarchies do not consider humans beings as a single group of equal participants, but rather they give some groups superiority over other groups: teachers have superiority over their students, the wealthy have superiority over the poor, and community leaders are superior to the rest of their communities.
 
Manipulation. 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/the-oppressor rel=noopener>Oppressors</a> use manipulation to control 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/the-oppressed rel=noopener>oppressed people</a> and to prevent them from challenging the oppressors’ power. The myths used in conquest are one example of this manipulation, but it also shows up when oppressor and oppressed classes make pacts (or other formal agreements) together. This creates the illusion of 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/f79289d1-0e54-407f-a954-ff4392fe94a1 rel=noopener>dialogue</a>, but in reality the oppressors determine what the agreement is and then often don’t follow it. Manipulation occurs when oppressed people first start to question the oppressive system. To combat it, revolutionary leaders should use critical awareness to constantly question the oppressors’ authority. 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/paulo-freire rel=noopener>Freire</a> contrasts revolutionary leaders with populist leaders, who claim to be an intermediary between the oppressed and their oppressors. Freire sees populism, along with things like welfare programs, as tools for manipulation that ultimately distract the oppressed from understanding the actual cause of their problems: 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/726418a8-2e2e-4c98-b880-8e1322c50636 rel=noopener>oppression</a> itself.</p><p>Manipulation relies on the fact that oppressive systems push oppressed people to trust the words and perspective of their oppressors. Freire distinguishes between suppressing oppressed people in an oppressive system, and manipulating them when they begin to lose faith in institutions of power. This is why Freire sees populism as a kind of manipulation: populist leaders attempt to work in oppressed people’s best interest, but they also convince oppressed people that the oppressor class is more trustworthy with a populist leader in power.</p><p>Cultural Invasion. In cultural invasion, 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/the-oppressor rel=noopener>oppressors</a> impose their own values and beliefs onto an oppressed culture. Cultural invasion makes oppressed peoples’ perspective align with that of the oppressors, so that the oppressors’ culture seems superior. This pushes oppressed people to become more like the oppressors, and stabilizes the oppressors’ position. 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/paulo-freire rel=noopener>Freire</a> argues that cultural invasion is both a tool and a result of 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/726418a8-2e2e-4c98-b880-8e1322c50636 rel=noopener>oppression</a>, and that traditional homes and schools also use forms of the oppressive hierarchy. However, he says that the revolution can also convert “professionals” in education and government who come to understand the nature of oppression. Freire then breaks down the revolutionary process into two stages: “dialogical action” that combats the oppressors’ power, and a “cultural revolution” that forms a new reality after the oppressed have won. While oppressors try to invade, and transform society, revolutions try to develop society in partnership with the oppressed.</p><p>Freire’s discussion of cultural invasion in the home is particularly interesting: he argues that the traditional dynamic of the home (in which parents are dominating authorities over their children) can be traced back to the social conditions that dominate oppressed people. Both homes and schools are spaces where young people learn how the world works, so Freire argues that they are spaces where people learn to adapt to an oppressive reality—not only oppressed people, but also “professionals” who unwittingly use an oppressive culture to try and help the oppressed.</p><p>Cooperation. From here, 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/paulo-freire rel=noopener>Freire</a> discusses “
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/f79289d1-0e54-407f-a954-ff4392fe94a1 rel=noopener>dialogical</a> action,” which is what revolutionary leaders should use to attack the 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/the-oppressor rel=noopener>oppressors’</a> antidialogical methods. Revolutionary leaders must have the support, dialogue, and trust of 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/the-oppressed rel=noopener>oppressed people</a> to be effective, and cooperation is how this happens. Unlike conquest, cooperation allows a revolutionary group to focus on 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/726418a8-2e2e-4c98-b880-8e1322c50636 rel=noopener>oppression</a> as a primary problem to solve. Leaders should account for oppressed peoples’ internalized beliefs while validating their knowledge—and Freire includes a quote from Che Guevara that emphasizes how oppressed people helped create his political ideology. When done properly, this cooperation can create a fusion of the oppressed and their leaders into a united force.</p><p>It’s important that Freire frames his entire theory of cultural action around dialogue: it emphasizes the responsibility of revolutionary leaders to act in partnership with oppressed people, not on their behalf. By citing Che Guevara, one of the most prominent revolutionaries in Latin American history, Freire shows in a concrete way how regular people have historically made vital contributions to liberation movements—and how Guevara recognized this as a leader.</p><p>Unity for Liberation. While 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/the-oppressor rel=noopener>oppressors</a> see unity as dangerous, revolutionary leaders must seek unity in every part of the

<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/the-oppressed rel=noopener>oppressed people</a> believe that the future is fixed, they will believe that changing the future with others is impossible. Therefore, achieving unity requires oppressed people to understand how and why they hold these beliefs—they must become aware of the myths that the oppressors have imposed on them. If successful, oppressed people will begin to see themselves as member of an oppressed class, a larger group that stands in opposition to the oppressor class. This diminishes the oppressors’ power, and enables the oppressed to more easily organize.</p><p>A key theme of Freire’s theory is that oppressors keep people separate, while revolutionaries must rely on bringing people together. This process of bringing people together often occurs in stages: Cooperation can lead to Unity for Liberation, which then leads to Organization. When oppressed people unite, they cannot simply see themselves as members of an oppressed class—they must also feel compelled to take action against the oppressor class. Otherwise, the difficult task of unifying the oppressed can be threatened, because oppressors can use institutions of power to manipulate and suppress.</p><p>Organization. Organization is the opposite of manipulation, and is the natural result of unity. While unifying

These leaders must show “witness” to oppressed people—they must express the importance of liberation, and show that they are acting out of love  and faith in the oppressed. 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/paulo-freire rel=noopener>Freire</a> points out that 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/the-oppressor rel=noopener>oppressors</a> do organize themselves apart from the people, which is why revolutionary leaders must organize “themselves with the people.” Although these leaders should use discipline and guidance to keep their group focused, they cannot manipulate or conquer the oppressed along the way. To Freire, organization is a “highly educational process” that teaches both oppressed people and their leaders how to wield authority and 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/d487450e-aa7a-4100-b4d9-93e6af0b9b71 rel=noopener>freedom</a> in service of each other.</p><p>In Freire’s view, oppressed people should not blindly trust the authority of a revolutionary leader, just as they should not blindly trust oppressors. Instead, revolutionaries have an obligation to prove their humility, trustworthiness, and love for people through “witness.” The act of witness ensures that oppressed people have the power to accept or reject anyone who wants to guide them in the struggle for liberation. Ideally, educational and political leaders work on the terms of the oppressed people they seek to serve.</p><p>The term “synthesis” recalls Freire’s notion of dialectics, and the idea that people can synthesize competing perspectives into a single resolution. Although cultural synthesis follows a dialectical logic, the scale here is larger than at other points in the text: cultural synthesis does not only rely on dialogue between people, but also on dialogue between entire cultures. The end of Chapter 4 mirrors the beginning of Chapter 1, as Freire returns to the “central problem” of humanization. Cultural action, and dialogue, for Freire, are not only theories—they are a concrete set of tactics that people can, and should, use in the radical struggle to humanize.</p><hr><a href=#theme><h1 id=theme><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Theme</h1></a><a href=#freedom-and-oppression><h2 id=freedom-and-oppression><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Freedom and oppression</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/paulo-freire rel=noopener>Freire</a> gives the term “

In other words, a person is free when they are able to understand and change their own conditions. According to Freire, this kind of freedom is a primary goal of all people, “the indispensible condition for the quest for human completion.” Freire also asserts that “humankind’s central problem”—the problem that he seeks to solve with Pedagogy of the Oppressed—is the problem of “

Freire argues that human beings can only solve dehumanization by striving for personal and social freedom, since only people who question and transform the world are able to feel fully human.</p><p>To Freire, 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/726418a8-2e2e-4c98-b880-8e1322c50636 rel=noopener>oppression</a> is a situation in which 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/the-oppressor rel=noopener>oppressors</a> impose unfair conditions on 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/the-oppressed rel=noopener>the oppressed</a>, preventing the oppressed from achieving freedom. Dehumanization is the natural result of oppression, and it refers to the effect oppression has on human beings. Since oppressors deny freedom to the oppressed, they make the oppressed less human. Freire argues that in an unjust system, the oppressors view humanity itself as an “exclusive right” or “inherited property.” Oppressed people, who are consistently denied freedom and treated like objects, often internalize this view of humanity. This is especially true because, in an oppressive system, people become successful when they become like the oppressors. When the oppressed see oppressive conditions as good or right, they can be paralyzed by a “fear of freedom.” Therefore, achieving freedom requires oppressed people to reject their previous notions of what a good or right society is, and to understand that an oppressive society cannot give them freedom.</p><p>To create the conditions for freedom, educators and political leaders have to enable oppressed people to affirm themselves and to question and change their own reality. This is a difficult proposition, since oppressors fear this affirmation, because it means that their superior position will be threatened. Furthermore, although educators and political leaders often sincerely try to fight oppression, they can quickly become oppressors themselves when they do not give oppressed people the freedom to understand oppression on their own terms.</p><p>In order to help the oppressed gain freedom, then, educators and political leaders must be careful with their methods. It’s crucial to trust oppressed people’s ability to come to their own conclusions, and to allow them to create change for themselves. When educators and political leaders seize too much power themselves, they rely on oppressive methods of teaching that take away the agency of the oppressed.</p><p>Freire suggests that enabling oppressed people to seek their own liberation is the only way to end dehumanization—not just of oppressed people, but of oppressors as well. When oppressors dehumanize the oppressed by denying them freedom, they simultaneously dehumanize themselves: Freire argues that oppressors prevent themselves from critically questioning their own conditions, because they rely on them to keep power. To achieve freedom for all human beings and create a new society, then, oppressed people have to

<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/the-oppressed rel=noopener>oppressed people</a> understand and change their society. He outlines the problems with oppressive education, describes the promises of liberating education, and shows how educational tools can have political applications that help a society attain and maintain 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/d487450e-aa7a-4100-b4d9-93e6af0b9b71 rel=noopener>freedom</a>. Freire’s goal with his book is to invent and describe an educational practice that can liberate oppressed people and change society.</p><p>Before speaking about his specific educational model, Freire talks more abstractly about a “pedagogy of the oppressed,” arguing that a “pedagogy of the oppressed” should push oppressed people to understand oppression. He says that oppressed people should be directly involved in the development of this pedagogy so that they have the freedom to learn about things that are relevant to their lives. This act of reflection should then push oppressed people to fight for their liberation, because it should show them that oppression can be changed. In light of this, Freire argues that “the pedagogy of the oppressed cannot be developed or practiced by the oppressors,” who would never actually help oppressed people become free.</p><p>However, Freire points out that only people with political power can implement a model of education on a large scale. Therefore, oppressed people should begin to implement the pedagogy of the oppressed on a smaller scale while they organize to fight for freedom. Freire calls these smaller uses of his pedagogy “educational projects,” and he conducted many of them in his native country of Brazil before publishing Pedagogy of the Oppressed in 1968.</p><p>Freire gives names to the two competing models of education described above: he calls the traditional pedagogy of modern education (education that reinforces oppression) the “
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/symbols/banking rel=noopener>banking</a> model,” and calls the liberating pedagogy he proposes the “problem-posing model.”</p><p>The “banking model” relies on a hierarchy in the classroom: the teacher is more knowledgeable than the students, and therefore has all the authority. In this model, the teacher “deposits” facts into the minds of the students, who have to memorize and recall those facts. Freire argues that the banking model recreates the oppressive social structure that many people live in: it makes one group of people superior to another, and lets the superior group determine what is good or correct.</p><p>The “problem-posing” model, on the other hand, creates a more equal relationship between the educator and their students: in a “problem-posing” classroom, everyone fills the role of teacher and student at the same time. These “teacher-students” and “student-teachers” decide together what topics are important to talk about, and the educator then presents these topics as “problems” for the whole class to solve. This model does not treat educators as more “correct” or “knowledgeable” than their students; instead, it assumes that everyone has something to contribute to the class. It’s much closer to Freire’s vision of a society without oppression, in which everyone’s voice has equal value.</p><p>Freire also shows that his pedagogy has applications in politics, as well as in education, since political leaders can use educational methods to bolster their political work. In the fight to change an oppressive system, political leaders have their own methods of challenging the oppressors’ power—and Freire argues that these methods have much in common with his pedagogy. For example, political leaders use “organization” to bring people together in a structured group, and Freire calls this method “highly educational.” When political leaders organize oppressed people to fight for freedom, they all learn how to create a social structure that allows everyone to be freedom.”</p><a href=#static-history-vs-fluid-history><h2 id=static-history-vs-fluid-history><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Static history vs Fluid History</h2></a><p>According to 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/paulo-freire rel=noopener>Freire</a>, “
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/d487450e-aa7a-4100-b4d9-93e6af0b9b71 rel=noopener>freedom</a>” (the freedom to critically question and change the world) requires people to gain a new understanding of how reality works. Changing the dominant understanding of history is a key part of this process. While an oppressive educational system treats history as a static group of facts that are separate from the present, 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/the-oppressed rel=noopener>the oppressed</a> have to develop a new view of history: groups of people changing their conditions over time. For Freire, this fluid view of history is inherently liberating and it can help oppressed people in the struggle to affirm their humanity.</p><p>To explain his concept of history, Freire argues that animals exist outside of history: they do not perceive time as a past, present, and future, but they “exist in an overwhelming present.” Humans, however, can understand that people have taken concrete actions in the past that affect human experience in the present; likewise, people in the present can take actions that affect the future. Therefore, history is an active relationship between humans and the world that affects people’s everyday lives. This awareness of history as being actively shaped by human choices empowers people to create change in the present, thereby steering the trajectory of the future.</p><p>By contrast, 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/the-oppressor rel=noopener>oppressors</a> can use a more static, traditional concept of history to preserve their own power. In order to preserve the oppressive system, oppressors must convince the oppressed that history is abstract and separate from human experience. Oppressors don’t want history to seem fluid: if people see their oppressive conditions as part of a constantly changing world, then they can also try to change those conditions. In order to protect their power, therefore, oppressors assert that their social order is the “good, correct, or healthy” way to organize a society; as a result, people don’t see 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/726418a8-2e2e-4c98-b880-8e1322c50636 rel=noopener>oppression</a> as a changeable part of history, but rather as the only way their society can work at all.</p><p>The traditional “
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/symbols/banking rel=noopener>banking</a> model” of education corresponds to this static view of history, as it presents knowledge as a group of various facts that students memorize and recall. In this model, a successful student changes their thinking to adapt to the oppressive system that’s imposed on them. Furthermore, as the teacher “deposits” knowledge into the students, the students do not consider how or why those facts are true. This separates the students from the historical conditions that determine what they learn.</p><p>“Problem-posing” education, on the other hand, investigates the ideas that influence a person’s historical moment. This often happens through a very specific process: the educator shows the participants a situation that affects their lives, and the participants then identify how they feel about that situation, and analyze how and why it might exist. The problem-posing model of education corresponds to a fluid and emancipatory view of history, because when people become critically aware of what ideas have influenced their conditions—such as the ideas that history is static and the status quo is good or neutral—they understand what actions they can take to change those conditions. Because the static view of history helps oppressors, Freire argues that educators and political leaders should use teaching methods that promote the more fluid, liberating view.</p><a href=#mantaining-and-overthrowing-oppression><h2 id=mantaining-and-overthrowing-oppression><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Mantaining and Overthrowing Oppression</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/paulo-freire rel=noopener>Freire</a> sees education as useful not just for individual growth, but also for achieving social change. To expand on this point, he discusses social change as a necessary tool to achieve 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/d487450e-aa7a-4100-b4d9-93e6af0b9b71 rel=noopener>freedom</a> and overthrow

Within Freire’s framework, systems of oppression try to prevent radical social change so that they do not lose power. Nevertheless, social change has the potential to maintain or overthrow oppression, depending on what methods people use to enact that change.</p><p>The primary goal of 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/the-oppressor rel=noopener>oppressors</a> is to prevent 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/the-oppressed rel=noopener>the oppressed</a> from enacting social change. The methods that oppressors use to maintain their power (“anti-dialogical action”) can block social change both before and while it happens. One of these methods is “Divide and Rule”: oppressors create internal divisions and rifts among oppressed people to keep them from organizing together. When the oppressed feel isolated or alienated from each other, they are much less likely to fight for change. Freire cites “community development projects” as an example of this in practice: when government agencies only focus their projects on small geographic areas, they separate the problems of one area from the problems of another area. This hinders the people in both areas from seeing that their problems are connected.</p><p>When oppressed people begin to understand their conditions and demand freedom from their oppressors, the oppressors use “Manipulation” to create the illusion of change. Freire uses the example of “pacts,” or formal agreements between oppressors and groups of oppressed people: agreements like these can mislead the oppressed into thinking that the two conflicting groups are cooperating. In reality, oppressors determine the agreement’s content, and may not even follow it—which means that the oppressed still do not have any power in the exchange.</p><p>However, even if radical social change does occur, it does not necessarily 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/726418a8-2e2e-4c98-b880-8e1322c50636 rel=noopener>liberate</a> the oppressed. A military coup, for example, does not liberate people because it does not rely on dialogue with those people to succeed; rather, coup leaders simply replace the oppressors’ interests with their own interests. Similarly, populist leaders claim to work in the interest of the oppressed, but see themselves as a part of the oppressive system. Because they do not seek to change the material conditions that oppress people, their work is less useful for meaningful social change.</p><p>Even revolutionary leaders, those who want to change the oppressive system for the people, sometimes use oppressive methods to create social change. When a leader has trouble gaining the support and trust of the oppressed, they may manipulate or dominate the oppressed to create a unified movement. However, Freire argues that this domination cannot create significant social change: because it doesn’t empower people to seek change for themselves, it prevents them from achieving freedom.</p><p>Throughout the text, Freire talks about education and revolution with equivalent vocabulary. The educational models Freire posits (the “
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/symbols/banking rel=noopener>banking</a>” model and “problem-posing” model) map onto his discussion of “anti-dialogical” and “dialogical” cultural action. According to Freire, “anti-dialogical action” (like the “banking model”) is a set of tools that oppressors use to divide and conquer the oppressed. “Dialogical action,” on the other hand, is used by revolutionary leaders to organize and empower the oppressed, much like problem-posing education.</p><p>Freire also constantly compares revolutionary leaders to educators: both roles carry an obligation to make people aware of the oppressive system in which they live, while helping them become invested in a common struggle for freedom. And just as a “problem-posing” education makes all participants into both students and teachers, revolutionary leaders have to see themselves as part of the oppressed—they must struggle with people, and not for them.</p><p>Freire makes this comparison to show the importance of liberating educational methods in the fight to overthrow oppression. To create lasting social change, oppressed people have to change how they think about their society—and this critical awakening can only happen by changing how people are educated. For Freire, every aspect of society should be directly aimed at empowering oppressed people</p><a href=#dialectics><h2 id=dialectics><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Dialectics</h2></a><p>Throughout Pedagogy of the Oppressed, 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/paulo-freire rel=noopener>Freire</a> draws heavily on the theories of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels—especially the concept of dialectics. A “dialectical” way of thinking starts with a “thesis” (an initial idea or proposition) and an “antithesis” (an idea that opposes or contradicts the thesis), and the interaction of these two ideas creates a “synthesis,” or a new idea that reconciles the conflict between the two original ideas. Freire argues that dialectics are the fundamental logic of reality, and he uses dialectic thought in his discussions of 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/726418a8-2e2e-4c98-b880-8e1322c50636 rel=noopener>oppression</a>, education, and social change. According to Freire, when 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/the-oppressed rel=noopener>oppressed people</a> come to see the world as “dialectical,” they become more aware of how reality works and can therefore affect reality to become more free.</p><p>Freire argues that dialectics are the natural logic of the world. In his theories of the world and of human consciousness, Freire brings up several examples of binary, conflicting ideas that must be resolved. For one, his model of history is dialectical: he points out that “
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/e6f1d447-a874-47dd-bac5-415948d28ebe rel=noopener>themes</a>” (the worldly expression of ideas and values during a historical moment) and “

<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/terms/726418a8-2e2e-4c98-b880-8e1322c50636 rel=noopener>liberation</a>.” As some people try to become free and others try to preserve their oppressive power, the contradiction is resolved through the social changes that happen over time.</p><p>Freire also uses dialectical methods in his theories of education and social change. Since Freire believes that history proceeds according to dialectical logic, he argues that understanding dialectical thought can help oppressed people take action to free themselves. The “
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/symbols/banking rel=noopener>banking</a> model” of education (where a teacher tells students to memorize and recall facts) is in no way dialectical. The teacher has knowledge, and he or she imposes that knowledge on the students. Freire’s “problem-posing model,” however, is dialectical in that teachers and students share important, and sometimes conflicting, ideas that are brought to a synthesis through group effort.</p><p>Freire uses the example of labor negotiation to explain how dialectical thought, as practiced in education, can be applied to political struggles. In this scenario, a group of oppressed workers wants to demand higher pay, while their leader wants to push for more radical changes. Freire argues that the solution to this problem lies in “synthesis”: the leader should work with the people to get higher wages, while challenging the people to ask why they should only ask for high wages. Although the leader and the people have opposing perspectives, the leader should reconcile those perspectives to create a new strategy.</p><p>It’s important to note that Freire’s dialectical approach has its flaws. Although dialectics are commonly used in Marxist philosophy, other critical approaches (particularly more recent ones) reject the notion that dialectical logic can explain history and reality. Freire divides society into a strict binary of 
<a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/the-oppressor rel=noopener>oppressors</a> and oppressed people, while a more nuanced view of oppression might consider intersectionality—the notion that social categories intermix in such a way that a person can be simultaneously oppressor and oppressed.</p><p>A more nuanced view of oppression might also consider the motivations of people who attempt to preserve the status quo. For example, Freire would condemn a political leader who wants to create significant social change, but only makes superficial changes that do not challenge the oppressive system. While Freire sees these small changes as a sign of “false generosity” (since he believes that a leader who truly cares about the oppressed should work to create a wholly new society), this view takes for granted that oppressors see themselves and the oppressed as being totally separate. Even when he talks about revolutionary leaders, Freire points out a contradiction that makes their role in the struggle more complicated. Revolutionary leaders must see themselves as part of the oppressed so that both groups can fight for freedom together; however, they also have to be distinct from the oppressed, so that they can organize and coordinate the groups. Although liberation resolves the contradictions in oppressors and oppressed people, it also relies on certain contradictions like this.</p><hr><a href=#terms><h1 id=terms><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Terms</h1></a><a href=#banking><h2 id=banking><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Banking</h2></a><p><a href=https://www.litcharts.com/lit/pedagogy-of-the-oppressed/characters/paulo-freire rel=noopener>Freire</a> uses the symbol of the bank to explain how a traditional,

In this traditional model, which Freire calls the “banking model” of education, knowledge functions as a kind of social currency that teachers possess and students do not. The job of the teacher is to “deposit” that knowledge into the consciousnesses of the students, whose job is then “receiving, filing, and storing the deposits.” Just as people deposit and withdraw their money at a bank, the teacher asks students to store and recall information that the teacher considers important. This image of “banking” also has a greater significance in the context of Freire’s Marxist tradition: banks are prominent institutions of modern capitalism, a system that Freire sees as oppressive.

Freire argues that education and political change must be “dialogic” to achieve freedom, compared to the “anti-dialogic” nature of oppression.</p><a href=#oppression-and-liberation><h2 id=oppression-and-liberation><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Oppression and Liberation</h2></a><p>Oppression is a situation in which one group of people imposes unfair conditions on another group, preventing the latter group from questioning or challenging those conditions. For Freire, all oppressive societies are made up of two distinct groups: oppressors and the oppressed. Liberation is the opposite of oppression, a situation in which the oppressed group challenges the power of their oppressors and changes their conditions.</p><a href=#dehumanization-and-humanization><h2 id=dehumanization-and-humanization><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Dehumanization and Humanization</h2></a><p>Dehumanization is a process that oppressors use to prevent human beings from achieving the freedom to understand and change their conditions. In an oppressive society, oppressors use dehumanization to maintain their power over others and prevent them from being more authentically human. Humanization, then, is the opposite process, which oppressed people use to become more free and affirm their identities.</p><a href=#freedom><h2 id=freedom><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Freedom</h2></a><p>When Freire uses the term freedom, he is specifically referring to the freedom to question, understand, and change one’s conditions in the world. Freire asserts that human beings naturally strive to achieve this kind of freedom, and that it is a key part of human identity. In this way, freedom is also the ultimate goal of Freire’s pedagogy.</p><a href=#dialectic><h2 id=dialectic><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Dialectic</h2></a><p>A dialectic is a contradiction or conflict between two separate ideas that are then synthesized into a new idea (i.e. thesis, antithesis, and synthesis). Dialectics are important to Marxist and Hegelian philosophy, and Freire argues that they represent the fundamental logic of the world. Therefore, Freire’s pedagogy relies on the use of dialectics to help students understand their conditions.</p><a href=#conscientização><h2 id=conscientização><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Conscientização</h2></a><p>Often translated as “critical consciousness,” conscientização is the process through which a person learns about the social and political contradictions of his/her life, and takes action to challenge them. Freire argues that conscientização is a necessary step for people to achieve freedom, and therefore it’s an important goal of his educational model.</p><a href=#verbalism-and-activism><h2 id=verbalism-and-activism><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Verbalism and Activism</h2></a><p>Verbalism and activism are specific ways of achieving freedom that, according to Freire, are ineffective. Verbalism occurs when a person reflects on their conditions, but does not take any concrete action to change them. Activism normally refers to taking action for a political goal, However, Freire gives it a more specific meaning here: activism occurs when a person takes concrete actions, but does not change how they think about their conditions. Freire argues that freedom can only be achieved through the combination of reflection and action, which he calls praxis.</p><a href=#theme-1><h2 id=theme-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Theme</h2></a><p>Themes are the worldly expression of people’s ideas, values, and feelings at a specific moment in history. For example, Freire argues that the most important themes of his time are domination and liberation—both are expressed in the world through the conflict between oppressors and oppressed people.</p><a href=#limit-situations><h2 id=limit-situations><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Limit-situations</h2></a><p>A limit-situation is a historical condition that prevents people from having freedom. Any limit-situation implies that some groups of people will benefit from it, while other people will be harmed. For example, Freire sees underdevelopment as a limit-situation that has harmed Third World countries.</p><a href=#pedagogy><h2 id=pedagogy><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Pedagogy</h2></a><p>A pedagogy is a set of methods and practices for teaching. In academic settings, the term refers to the broader study of educational practices; it can include discussions of how students learn, how teachers interact with their students, and how different types of teaching create different classroom environments.</p></article><hr><div class=page-end id=footer><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li>No backlinks found</li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://potatomat0.github.io/obsidian-public-vault/js/graph.6579af7b10c818dbd2ca038702db0224.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Nhat Hoang © 2023</p><ul><li><a href=https://potatomat0.github.io/obsidian-public-vault/>Home</a></li><li><a href=http://nhatkothieunang.web.app/>Other hobby links</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/potatomat0/obsidian-public-vault>GitHub</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
