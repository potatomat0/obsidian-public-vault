**INTRODUCTION**

Some jobs have higher moral reputations than others, and national surveys are routinely conducted to reveal public attitudes about various professions. One poll asked people to rate the honesty and ethical standards of people in different fields. The results of the survey were as follows (the numbers indicated the percentage of those surveyed who ranked the respective vocations very high in terms of honesty and ethical standards):

Nurses: 82%

Druggists, pharmacists: 70%

Grade school teachers: 70%

Medical doctors: 69%

Military officers: 69%

Police officers: 54%

Clergy: 47%

Day care providers: 46%

Judges: 45%

Nursing home operators: 32%

Auto mechanics: 29%

Bankers: 27%

Local officeholders: 23%

Business executives: 22%

Newspaper reporters: 21%

TV reporters: 20%

Lawyers: 20%

State officeholders: 14%

Advertising practitioners: 14%

Car salespeople: 9%

Members of Congress: 8%

Lobbyists: 6%

It is important to understand that these survey results only report people’s _perceptions_ of professional ethical behavior, and are not evaluations of actual professional behavior. But business is an area where perception is often everything, and businesspeople in advertising and public relations certainly know this. The above results present a clear pattern of perception. The highest ranking professions involve helping people, and nurses, who are at the very top, are clear examples. Among the lowest ranking occupations are those associated with the business world: bankers, business executives, advertisers, and, near the very bottom, car salespeople.

             What is it that makes us have such low opinions of the moral integrity of the business world? Part of it may be that, in contrast with nurses, businesses have the reputation of caring only for themselves and not for others. Part of it may also be that the competitive nature of business pushes even the most decent of people to put profits above responsibility to the public. Businesses, of course, respond to these negative perceptions in creative ways. For example, Costco, Wallgreens, Kroger and other retailers now provide inexpensive flu shots to customers. This performs a genuine social service and at the same time bolsters their ethical reputation by reinforcing their link with health care.

             The concept of business ethics is by no means new; in fact, some of the earliest written documents in human civilization wrestle with these issues. The Mesopotamian Code of Hammurabi, from almost 4,000 years ago, had this to say about the responsibility of building contractors:

If a builder builds a house for someone, and, even though he has not yet completed it, if afterwards the walls seem toppling, then the builder must make the walls solid at his own expense.

            If a shipbuilder builds a boat for someone, and does not make it tight, and if during that same year that boat is sent away and leaks, then the shipbuilder shall take the boat apart and put it together tight at his own expense. [Sect. 233]

This entire book is devoted to understanding the ethical challenges that businesses face and what can be done to meet those challenges. In this chapter, we will explore several basic and time-tested principles of morality. Some of history’s greatest minds have reflected on the nature of morality and devised theories of where morality comes from and how moral principles should guide our conduct. Many of these principles have direct application to ethical issues within business, and we will explore that connection. As we go through these theories, several will be associated with famous figures like Plato, Aristotle, Kant and Mill. While these thinkers may have given the classic expression of these concepts, in many cases did not invent them, nor did they single-handedly integrate them into notions of morality. We find these principles important today because each reflects a way that we naturally think about moral issues. It is not just a lesson in the history of ethics, but a checklist of the features that we currently believe are relevant to ethical behavior.

 **WHERE MORAL VALUES COME FROM**

A good definition of ethics is that it is an organized analysis of values relating to human conduct, with respect to their rightness and wrongness. Ethics is not the same as _etiquette_, which merely involves customary codes of polite behavior, such as how we greet people and how we seat guests at a table. The issue in ethics is not what is polite, but what is obligatory. _Ethics_ is closely related to _morality_, and although some ethicists make subtle distinctions between the two, they are more often used interchangeably, as will be done throughout this book.

             One of the most basic ethical issues involves an understanding of where our moral values come from. Consider the moral mandates that we should not kill, steal, or lie, which most of us adopt. If I asked you were you got those values, you’d likely answer that they were passed on to you from your parents, friends, co-workers, and religious institutions. That would a correct answer since we are all products of our surroundings: if you hunt, you probably do so because your parents do; if you like country music that is also probably because of your parents. But with values like “don’t steal” we have a need to push the question beyond our immediate social influences and ask where society itself got those principles. Are these universal and unchanging truths that are somehow embedded in the fabric of the universe, or are they changeable guidelines that we humans have created ourselves to suit our needs of the moment? The question of where our moral values come from often involves two issues: The first is a debate between objectivism and relativism, and the second concerns the relation between morality and religion. We will look at each of these.

 **Moral Objectivism and Moral Relativism**

Some years ago, the Lockheed Corporation was caught offering a quarter of a billion dollars in bribes overseas. A major U.S. defense contractor, Lockheed fell on economic hard times. The U.S. government commissioned the company to design a hybrid aircraft, but after one crashed, the government canceled orders. Because of this and other mishaps, Lockheed believed that the solution to its financial woes was to expand its aircraft sales into foreign countries. But to get military aircraft contracts with foreign governments, it made a series of payoffs to middlemen who had political influence in West Germany, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and several other countries. The company was eventually caught and punished with a heavy fine, and its chairman and president were forced to resign. A consequence of this event was the creation of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which includes an anti-bribery provision that involves stiff fines and prison terms for offenders. The message of the law was that, when in Rome, you should not do as the Romans do. There are overarching standards of ethical conduct that business are expected to follow, regardless of where they are in the world and what the local business practices are there.

             When Lockheed engaged in systematic bribery, did it violate a universal standard of morality that is binding on all human societies, or did it just violate a standard of morality that is merely our personal preference in the United States? On the one side of this question is the theory of moral objectivism, which has three key components:

1. _Morality is objective_: Moral standards are not created by human beings or human societies. According to many objectivists, they exist in a higher spirit realm that is completely apart from the physical world around us.

2. _Moral standards are unchanging_: Moral standards are eternal and do not change throughout time or from location to location. No matter where you are in the world or at what point in history, the same principles apply.

3. _Moral standards are universal_: There is a uniform set of moral standards that is the same for all people, regardless of human differences like race, gender, wealth, and social standing.

The classic champion of this view is the ancient Greek philosopher Plato (424 BCE–347 BCE), who argued that moral truths exist in a higher level of reality that is spiritual in nature. According to Plato, the universe as a whole is two-tiered. There is the lower physical level that consists of rocks, trees, human bodies, and every other material object that we see around us. All of this is constantly changing, either decaying or morphing into something else. Within this level of the universe, nothing is permanent.

             On the other hand, Plato argued, there is a higher level of the universe, which is nonphysical and is the home of eternal truths. He called this the realm of the forms, which are perfect patterns or blueprints for all things. Mathematical principles are good examples. They are completely unchanging and in no way dependent for their existence on the changing physical world. Even if the entire physical universe were destroyed, and another emerged, the principles of mathematics would remain the same, unchanged.

             According to Plato, moral principles are just like mathematical principles in that respect, and they also exist in the higher realm of the forms. Just as the principle that 1 + 1 = 2 exists permanently in this realm, so too do moral principles of goodness, justice, charity, and many others. The greatest appeal of Plato’s theory is that it gives us a sense of moral stability. When someone is murdered, we often believe that an absolute and unchanging moral principle has been violated that goes well beyond the shifting preferences of our particular human community.

             On the other side of this dispute is the theory of moral relativism, which has three contrasting key features:

1.  _Morality is not objective_: moral standards are purely human inventions that are created either by individual people or human societies.

2.  _Moral standards are not unchanging_: Moral standards change throughout time and from society to society.

3.  _Moral standards are not universal_: Moral standards do not necessarily apply universally to all people, and their application depends on human preference.

Defenders of moral relativism are typically skeptical about the existence of any higher realm of absolute truth, such as Plato’s realm of the forms. Although notions of eternal moral truths are appealing, the fact is, says the moral relativist, we do not have any direct experience that such higher realms exist. What we know for sure is the physical world around us, which contains societies of human beings that are ever-changing. The moral values that we see throughout these societies are ones that are created by human preference and change throughout history and with geographical location. Simply put, morality is a human creation, not an eternal truth.

             Between moral objectivism and moral relativism, which is right? Some philosophical questions are not likely to be answered any time soon, and this is one of them. However, we can take inspiration from both sides of the debate. With the Lockheed bribery incident, the position of the U.S. government was that there is a standard of integrity in business that applies worldwide, not just within U.S. borders. This is a concession to moral objectivism. On the other hand, some business practices are culturally dependent. In Japan, new businesses typically have an opening ceremony in which a Shinto priest blesses the company building. U.S. companies operating in Japan often follow this practice, and this is a concession to moral relativism.        

**Religion and Morality**

An organization called the Center for Christian Business Ethics Today offers a Christian approach to ethical issues in business. According to the organization, God is the ultimate source of moral values: “God’s standards as set forth in God’s Word, the Bible, transcend while incorporating both the law and ethics” (Center for Christian Business Ethics Today, n.d.). This view is by no means unique, and is in fact part of a long history of efforts to ground morality in some aspect of religion. According to the classic view of religious ethics, true morality does not emerge from human thought processes or human society alone. It begins with God establishing moral truths, instilling moral convictions within human nature, and reinforcing those moral truths through scripture. Religious believers who follow God’s path will be motivated to follow God’s established moral truths, perhaps more so than non-believers who view ethics as a purely human invention. This classic view of religious ethics raises two questions:

1. Is God the creator of moral values?

2. Do religious believers have better access to moral truth than non-believers?

             Regarding the first question—whether God creates moral values—a position called divine command theory answers yes: Moral standards are created by God’s will. God in essence creates them from nothing, not even basing them on any prior standard of reason or logic. God pronounces them into existence through a pure act of will. There are two challenges that divine-command theory faces. First, it presumes in the first place that God exists, and that is an assumption that non-believers would reject from the start. Many religious believers themselves would hold that belief in God is a matter of personal faith, not absolute proof, and so we must be cautious about the kinds of activities that we ascribe to God, such as creating absolute moral truths. Second, the moral standards that God willfully creates would be arbitrary if they were made purely from scratch, without relying on any prior standard of reason. What would prevent God from willfully creating a random set of moral values, which might include principles like “lying is OK” or “stealing is OK”? God could also willfully change his mind about which moral principles he commands. Maybe he could mandate that stealing is wrong on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, but that stealing is OK during the rest of the week.

             Many ethicists throughout history—even ones who were devout religious believers—have rejected divine command theory for this reason. To avoid arbitrariness, it seems that morality would need to be grounded in some stable rational standard, such as with Plato’s view of absolute moral truths. That is, God would merely endorse these absolute moral truths since they seem rationally compelling to him; and he does not literally create them from nothing. If morality, then, is really grounded in preexisting truths, then we humans can discover them on our own, and do not need to depend on God for our moral knowledge.

             Again, the second question raised by the classic view of religious ethics is whether believers have better access to moral truth than non-believers. The answer to this throughout much of history was yes: Religion is an essential motivation for moral conduct. To behave properly, people need to believe that a divine being is watching them and will punish them in the afterlife for immoral conduct. The French moral philosopher Voltaire (1694–1778) famously stated that “if God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him,” precisely because moral behavior depends so much on belief in divine judgment. In more recent times, this position has fallen out of favor, and there is wider acceptance of the view that believers are not necessarily more moral than non-believers.

             One reason for this change in attitude is that our society as a whole has become much more secularized than Voltaire’s was, and, from our experience, non-believers do not appear to be particularly bad citizens. Also, it appears that believers fall into the same moral traps as everyone else.

             The upshot is that both components of classic religious ethics are difficult to establish: It is not clear that God creates moral values, assuming that God exists, and it is not clear that believers have a special advantage in following moral rules. It is undeniable that, for many believers, religion is an important source of moral inspiration, and that fact should not be minimized. Undoubtedly, this is true for the members of the Center for Christian Business Ethics Today. At the same time, though, there are plenty of nonreligious motivations to do the right thing, such as a fear of going to jail, a desire to be accepted by one’s family and friends, or a sense of personal integrity. In the business world there are additional motivations to be moral, such as the desire to avoid lawsuits, costly fines, or tarnishing the company name.

             One of the consequences of religious ethics in the workplace is the shaping of company policy in ways that might clash with secular social norms. Hobby Lobby is a case in point, which, on religious grounds, opposed a Federal government requirement to provide emergency contraception as part of its employee healthcare benefits. The company’s founder and CEO, David Green, stated that “We're Christians, and we run our business on Christian principles” and “Being Christians, we don't pay for drugs that might cause abortions.” The case went to the Supreme Court, which, in a landmark decision, ruled in favor of the company on the grounds that the Federal law posed a substantial burden on the company’s exercise of religion.

**ETHICS AND PSYCHOLOGY**

An important set of ethical issues involves our psychological makeup as human beings. There is no doubt that our personal expectations, desires, and thought processes have an impact on what motivates us to behave morally. In the way that inborn feline psychology directly impacts the way that your pet cat behaves, maybe there are parallel psychological restrictions on humans that box us into specific moral behaviors. If so, the question of “where does morality come from” might be at least partially answered by looking at human psychology.  In this section, we will look at two central issues of moral psychology; one focuses on our psychological inclination to be selfish, and the other on how gender shapes our moral outlook.

**Egoism and Altruism**

When the U.S. Gulf Coast was pummeled by Hurricane Katrina, the home-improvement company Lowe’s donated millions of dollars and coordinated busloads of volunteers to help with the cleanup. Working alongside the nonprofit organization Habitat for Humanity, they helped rebuild homes for people across the Gulf Coast region. Since the time of Katrina, Lowe’s has continued the practice of partnering with charitable organizations to help rebuild disaster-stricken areas. Why do they do this? Is it purely from a sense of goodwill towards those in need, or do they expect to get some benefit out of it, such as free publicity? We can ask this same kind of question about our conduct as individuals: Are we capable of acting solely for the benefit of others, or do we always act in ways that ultimately benefit ourselves? There are two competing theories that address this question:

• Psychological egoism: Human conduct is selfishly motivated and we cannot perform actions from any other motive.

• Psychological altruism: Human beings are at least occasionally capable of acting selflessly.

Both of these theories are “psychological” in the sense that they are making claims about what internally motivates human behavior.

             Psychological egoism maintains that all of our actions, without exception, are motivated by some selfish drive. Even when I am doing something, like donating to charity, that appears to be purely for the benefit of someone else, there are hidden selfish motives at work within me and I am only acting to benefit myself. Maybe through my charitable action I secretly hope that I will receive a Citizen of the Year award. Maybe I desire to hear the recipient of my charity thank me with gushing words of appreciation so that I can feel good about myself. The English philosopher Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679) argued that all acts of charity could be reduced to our private desire to exercise control over other people’s lives. For Hobbes, I am the one who decides whether a poor person will have enough food to eat today, and I am on a private power trip if I help that person out (1650/1811 _Human Nature_). A psychological egoist would look at Lowe’s with similar suspicion: Their public acts of charity are great public-relations tools that associate their name and products with social responsibility. Through press releases and advertisements, Lowe’s spreads the news of its charitable work far and wide.

             The rival theory of psychological altruism concedes that much of our human conduct is indeed motivated by selfish desire. But, according to the altruist, there is more going on with us psychologically than just that. We have the capacity to break free of the grip that selfishness has on us and at least occasionally act purely for the betterment of other people. Perhaps we have an instinct of human kindness that exhibits itself when we see people who are truly in need. Our hearts go out to them and we want to help, regardless of whether there is any benefit to ourselves. Maybe some of that is behind Lowe’s charitable programs. Its corporate officers and managers are personally moved by tragedies such as Katrina and recognize that Lowe’s has unique resources to help. The public relations benefit it gains from those acts is secondary, and the spark that ignites its charitable response is genuine concern.

Like the dispute between objectivism and relativism, this debate between psychological egoism and altruism will not be resolved any time soon. But even if psychological egoists are correct that all of our actions are selfishly motivated, the fact remains that human beings do perform acts of charity, and, morally speaking, it is good for us to do so. Other people still benefit from my charitable actions even if I am motivated by a personal power trip as Hobbes suggests, and that still counts as moral. In some ways, the theory of psychological egoism is liberating since it does not require me to be like Gandhi and have purely selfless motives behind all of my actions. Rather, I can unapologetically admit that my actions are always guided by self-interest, yet at the same time direct my self-interest in ways that also benefit others. In the business arena, what matters is that Lowe’s engages in charitable projects, regardless of whether their main motivation is to bolster their corporate image.

**Gender and Morality**

A recent study suggested that businesses led by women place a higher value on social responsibility than do those led by men. According to the director of the study, “women are taking the lead in showing that profit and social responsibility can go hand-in-hand” (Llanza, 2011). Women tend to look for a balance between profits and non-economic goals such as environmental sustainability, charity, and community involvement. Is this study flawed? That is, do businessmen and businesswomen really have differing attitudes about the role of ethics within their companies?

             Underlying this question is the issue of whether men and women generally speaking have different ways of thinking about morality. The long standing assumption about morality has been that there is only one way of thinking about it, regardless of gender. There are moral rules that guide our conduct; we all need to learn those rules and follow them in our behavior. It is much like any other task that we perform: If I am playing a sport, performing on a musical instrument, or operating a circular saw, there are clear rules for how I should proceed. Regardless of whether I am male or female, if I do not follow those rules, then I will not be good at the task. So too with morality: Men and women alike need to understand the rules of ethics and follow them in order to be morally good people.

However, in recent years, this one-size-fits-all assumption about morality has been called into question based on a reexamination of the different psychological tendencies of men and women. Consider the types of college majors that attract men and women, respectively. Some are very male dominated, such as mathematics, physics, and engineering. Others are dominated by women, such as psychology, social work, nursing, and education. Perhaps this suggests that men have a thought process that emphasizes rules and are thus attracted to those disciplines that emphasize them. Women, by contrast, place greater value on nurturing and caring for others and are thus attracted to those disciplines. It may well be that these gender issues are operating on our conceptions of morality: For men, morality mainly involves following rules, and for women, it mainly involves caring for others.

             A recent theory called **care ethics** advances this view, maintaining that women see morality as the need to care for people who are in situations of vulnerability and dependency. Advocates of this view are not suggesting that we should leave the task of caring and nurturing to women, while letting men adhere to their rule-following inclinations. Rather, the task of moral care falls upon all of us, although we should expect women to place greater emphasis on this than men.

             Back to the original question: do businessmen and businesswomen really have differing attitudes about the role of ethics within their companies? The study mentioned above cannot by itself firmly establish such a controversial position. Further, as a male, I would hope that women do not have a biological advantage for social responsibility in business. Men could still be socially responsible, but it would make it harder to link personal interests with broader social ones, and when it comes to morality we need all the help that we can get.

**MORAL STANDARDS**

So far we have looked at where morality comes from and how it is shaped by human psychology. Although these theories are important for telling us about the nature of morality, they do not necessarily tell us how we should behave, and what the moral standards are that we should follow. We turn next to that issue and explore three approaches to moral standards: virtue theory, duty theory, and utilitarianism.

**Virtues**

One of the strangest business stories in recent years is that of Bernard Madoff, who scammed investors out of $65 billion in a Ponzi scheme. He started out as a small-time investment manager, but, courting wealthy investors from around the globe, he eventually built his roster of clients up to 4,800. Offering a steady return of about 10% per year, he covered these payouts with money coming in from new investors. But when his clients rushed to withdraw $7 billion during a major stock-market decline, he could not cover those expenses and he confessed to the fraud.

             The humiliation for Madoff’s whole family was so great that he and his wife attempted suicide, and shortly afterward their son did kill himself. When we look at Madoff as a human being, we see that his immoral business conduct was a consequence of his flawed character. His desire for money, power, and a lavish lifestyle became so excessive that it created a trap for him from which he could not break free. He had what moral philosophers call vices: bad habits of character that result in a serious moral failing. He was unjust, deceitful, intemperate, overambitious, and immodest. What Madoff lacked were virtues—the opposite of vices—which are good habits of character that result in morally proper behavior. He did not have the virtues of justice, truthfulness, temperance, restraint, and modesty.

             Virtue theory is the view that morality is grounded in the virtuous character traits that people acquire. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle (384 BCE–322 BCE) developed the most influential analysis of virtues, which even today is considered the standard view of the subject (trans. 2002 by J. Sachs). It all begins with our natural urges. For example, we all have natural desires for pleasure, and we automatically gravitate towards pleasurable activities such as entertainment, romance, eating, and even social drinking. With each of these pleasurable activities, though, there are three distinct habits that we can develop. On the one hand, we might eat too much, drink too much, and become addicted to all sorts of pleasurable activities. This is the vice of overindulgence. At the opposite extreme, we might reject every form of pleasure that comes our way, and live like monks locked in their monastery cells. This is the vice of insensibility, insofar as we have become desensitized to the happiness that pleasures can bring us. There is, though, a third habitual response to pleasure that stands midway between these two extremes: We can enjoy a wide range of pleasures in moderate amounts, and this is the virtue of temperance. In Madoff’s case, we can say that he was driven by the desire for wealth, he habitually overindulged in the acquisition of it, and completely lacked the virtue of temperance.

According to Aristotle, most virtues and vices match this scheme:

• There is a natural urge (such as the desire for pleasure),

• there is a vice of excess (such as overindulgence),

• there is a vice of deficiency (such as insensibility), and

• there is a virtue at the middle position between the two extremes (such as temperance).

Take the virtue of courage, which is driven by our natural fear of danger. If we go to an excess, we develop the vice of rashness, where we lose all fear of danger and rush into hazardous situations that might kill us. If we are deficient in courage, we become timid and develop the vice of cowardliness. The virtuous middle ground of courage is one in which we respect the dangers before us but, when the circumstances are right, we rise above our fears.

             A large part of our childhood involves cultivating virtuous habits and avoiding vicious ones, and during our formative years our parents bear much of the responsibility to shape us in virtuous directions. As I become older, though, the responsibility becomes mine alone, and I must think carefully about exactly where that virtuous middle ground is. How much habitual eating can I do before I become overindulgent? How much can I habitually hide from danger before I become a coward? Finding that perfect middle ground, Aristotle says, is not easy, but it is something that the moral person must figure out nonetheless. Madoff did not even come close. His desires for wealth, power, and fame were so all-consuming that the virtue of temperance became out of reach for him.

**Duties**

A small computer software company named Plurk accused the software giant Microsoft of computer code theft. The product in question was blogging software that Microsoft developed for its market in China and which it hoped would catch hold in that country the way Facebook has in the United States. Around 80% of the computer code for Microsoft’s product was lifted directly from blogging software created by Plurk. Microsoft apologized for the episode and said that the fault rested with an outside company it had hired to develop the blogging software. It was that outside company that copied Plurk’s computer code (Nystedt, 2009). The irony is that Microsoft zealously guards against software piracy and code theft of its own products, but here it did that very thing, even if only indirectly. In this situation, there was no moral gray area: Theft is wrong, the evidence for code theft was incontestable, and Microsoft had no choice but to immediately admit to it and apologize.

             This Microsoft case highlights the fact that there are at least some principles of morality that we all clearly recognize and endorse. One moral theory in particular emphasizes the obvious and intuitive nature of moral principles. Duty theory is the position that moral standards are grounded in instinctive obligations—or duties—that we have. It is also called deontological theory, from the Greek word for duty. The idea behind duty theory is that we are all born with basic moral principles or guidelines embedded in us, and we use these to judge the morality of people’s actions.

             There are two approaches to duty theory. First, some moral theorists hold that we have a long catalog of instinctive obligations. The list of the Ten Commandments is a classic example. Among those listed are obligations not to kill, steal, bear false witness, or covet your neighbor’s things. These are all basic moral principles that cultures around the world have endorsed from the earliest times. If you are thinking about stealing computer code, these principles tell you that it would be wrong to do so. With enough principles like these, we will have some standard for judging a wide range of human actions. Many moral philosophers have developed and expanded the list of our intuitive duties beyond the Ten Commandments to include a few dozen of them.

             The second approach is that there is a single instinctive principle of duty that we all should follow; the Golden Rule is the best example of this. That is, I should do to others what I would want them to do to me. If I am thinking about stealing someone’s computer code, I should consider whether I would want someone to steal my code. If I am thinking about lying to someone, I should consider whether I would want someone to lie to me. So too with good actions: When considering whether I should donate to charity, I should consider how I would feel if I were a needy person dependent on the charity of others. Like those in the Ten Commandments, the Golden Rule is a time-honored moral principle that we find in cultural traditions around the world, dating back thousands of years.

             In more recent times, one of the most influential theories of duty is that developed by the German philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724–1804). Inspired by the Golden Rule, Kant offered a single principle of moral duty, which he called the “categorical imperative”— a term which simply means “absolute command” (1785/1996). The categorical imperative, for Kant, was this: Treat people as an end, and never merely as a means to an end. His point was that we should treat all people as beings that have value in and of themselves, and not treat anyone as a mere instrument for our own advantage.

             There are two parts to his point. The first involves treating people as ends that have value in and of themselves. We value many things in life, such as our cars, our homes, and a good job. Most of the things we value, though, have only instrumental value, that is, value as a means for achieving something else. Our cars are instruments of transportation. Our homes are instruments of shelter. Our jobs are instruments of obtaining money.

             Other times, though, we appreciate things because they have intrinsic value: We value them for the special qualities that they have in and of themselves, and not because of any instrumental value that they have. Human happiness has intrinsic value, and so too do experiences of beauty and friendship. The first part of the categorical imperative, then, says that we should treat all people as beings with intrinsic value and regard them as highly as we would our own happiness. If I steal someone’s computer code, I am not respecting the owner the way I value my own happiness. The second part of the categorical imperative is that we should not treat people as things that have mere instrumental value. People are not tools or objects that we should manipulate for our own gratification. If I steal someone’s computer code, I am using the owner for my own gain.

             Like the Golden Rule, the categorical imperative provides a litmus test for determining whether any action is right or wrong. It not only detects immoral actions such as lying and stealing, but it also tells us when actions are moral. When I donate to charity, for example, I am thinking of the value of the needy people who will benefit from my contribution; I am not merely thinking of any benefit that I may receive through my charity.

             In the business world, there are occasionally times when an action is so obviously wrong that there is no point in defending it. That was true of Microsoft and also of Madoff, who immediately admitted to his crime once his company became insolvent. In cases like these, duty theory is at its best. In other cases, though, morality is a little more blurry. Napster is a good example. A decade before BitTorrent, Napster was the first widely used peer-to-peer file-sharing program, and it enabled users to easily pirate MP3 music files, directly violating the copyrights of record companies. While this at first appears to be a clear case of a software product that intentionally enabled users to steal, many people within the music industry itself defended Napster. Record companies had become stuck in their old ways of selling records and CDs and had not developed a good mechanism for consumers to purchase MP3 files separately at a reasonable price. Napster entered the music market as a rogue competitor, and forced record companies to be more responsive to the needs of their consumers. In a sense, Napster was a positive force within the music industry, and is partly responsible for jumpstarting legal methods of purchasing MP3 files on ITunes and Amazon.com. Duty theory may not be well suited for making moral pronouncements in complex cases like Napster’s; other moral theories discussed in this chapter may need to be drawn upon.

**Utilitarianism**

CVS Pharmacy recently stopped selling cigarettes in their 7,600 U.S stores. The reason, they said, is that it “is simply the right thing to do for the good of our customers and our company. The sale of tobacco products is inconsistent with our purpose – helping people on their path to better health” (www.cvshealth.com/research-insights/health-topics/this-is-the-right-thing-to-do). Tobacco use is certainly unhealthy, and the Center for Disease Control says that it is responsible for nearly half a million deaths in the U.S. per year. But a natural reaction to CVS’s decision is that there is more going on than simply doing the right thing. Tobacco accounts for a large portion of retail sales—39% of convenience store in-store sales according to the National Association of Convenient Stores. Dollar General has recently begun selling tobacco and report sales increase. All businesses make decisions based on a cost-benefit analysis: They research both the costs and the benefits of a particular decision, then determine whether the costs outweigh the benefits or vice versa. We do not know the confidential details of CVS’s cost-benefit analysis of their tobacco decision, but the public relations advantages are clear, and if other pharmacy companies feel pressure to do the same thing, this would level the playing field for CVS. Ultimately, CVS is gambling that the long-term economic advantages of their decision will outweigh the short-term losses.

             Cost-benefit analysis is the distinguishing feature of the moral theory of utilitarianism: An action is morally right if the consequences of that action are more favorable than unfavorable to everyone. When determining the morality of any given action, we should list all of the good and bad consequences that would result, determine which side is weightier, and judge the action to be right if the good outweighs the bad. There are three components to this theory. First, it emphasizes _consequences_. One of the founders of utilitarianism was the British philosopher Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832), who argued that by focusing on consequences we make our moral judgments more scientific (1789/1907). To ground morality in the will of God requires that we have a special ability to know God’s thoughts. To ground morality in conscience or instinctive duties requires that we have special mental faculties and know how to use them properly. None of this is precise, and it all relies too much on hunches. According to Bentham, a more scientific approach to morality would look only at the facts that everyone can plainly see, and consequences of actions are those facts. If I steal a car, there are very clear consequences: I gain a vehicle, but I cause financial harm and distress to the victim and put myself at risk of a long stay in prison. We all can see these consequences and assess their weights. Bentham held that we can even give numerical values to the various consequences and mathematically calculate whether the good outweighs the bad, a practice that we now call the _utilitarian calculus_. Not all utilitarians go this far, but it does highlight the central role that publicly observed consequences play in the utilitarian conception of morality.

             The second component of utilitarianism is that it focuses on the consequences of happiness and unhappiness. While businesses assess costs and benefits in terms of financial gains and losses, utilitarianism focuses instead on how our actions affect human happiness. Some utilitarians, like Bentham, emphasize pleasure and pain; others emphasize goodness and badness; and still others emphasize overall benefit and disbenefit. What they have in common, though, is that moral conduct is in some way linked with human happiness and immoral conduct with unhappiness.

             The third component of utilitarianism is that we need to assess the beneficial consequences of actions as _everyone_ is affected. If I am thinking about stealing a car, I need to consider the consequences of my conduct for myself, my family, the victim, the victim’s family, and anyone else who might be affected by my action. This is reflected in utilitarianism’s famous motto that we should seek the greatest good for the greatest number of people. Utilitarianism does not necessarily aim to benefit the majority of people, but rather to maximize the overall amount of happiness resulting from a decision. For example, abolishing racial segregation in the U.S. South may have been unpleasant for the white majority as a whole, but that was counter-balanced by a much greater degree of unhappiness that segregation created for the black minority as a whole.

             There is an important down side to utilitarianism, though, which its critics frequently point out. What if, for example, retaining racial segregation had created more total happiness for the white majority than the total unhappiness for the black minority?  Retaining segregation, then, would have then been morally justifiable on utilitarian grounds. More generally, the problem is that sometimes a recognizably evil course of action will produce the greatest amount of happiness. Utilitarians have proposed different strategies for working around this problem, but the problem is nevertheless a lingering one. This does not mean that utilitarianism should be discarded as a moral guideline, and, in fact, utilitarianism is so embedded in human moral thinking that it would be impossible to do so. What it does mean is that utilitarian decisions should sometimes be cross-checked with other moral standards, such as duties or virtues.

Because businesspeople are so familiar with financial cost-benefit analysis, utilitarianism is a natural way to make moral assessments with business decisions. If CVS’s decision to stop selling tobacco allows them to better position themselves and their stakeholders in the healthcare industry, then their move will be justified on utilitarian grounds. If, on the other hand, they and their stakeholders reap no future financial rewards but only incur losses from their decision, then it was not justified. CVS clearly believed that it was worth the gamble, and only time will tell. 

**MORALITY AND GOVERNMENT**

In this final section, we will examine some moral theories that pertain to governments and the laws that they create. From the start, it is important to look at the boundaries that separate morality and laws. What they have in common is that they both command us to behave in certain ways, and often their edicts are the same. It is immoral to steal, and it is also illegal. It is immoral to assault someone, and it is also illegal. However, there are many instances where morality and legality do not overlap. Adultery, for example, is immoral, but in the United States it is not illegal in most states. So too with cheating on school exams: it’s wrong but you will not go to jail for it. Similarly, there are some actions that are illegal but not immoral. Going 36 in a 35-mph zone is illegal but not necessarily immoral. Similarly, some instances of mercy killing may be morally justifiable, even though they are currently illegal.

             The lesson here is that morality is often consistent with the law and may even be an important source of inspiration for the law, but it is not the last word on the issue. In business ethics, it is sometimes important to consider issues of morality and legality separately. Perhaps we will find some immoral actions in business which are not illegal but should be. Or we might find some morally permissible actions that are illegal, but should be made legal. The three main issues that we will focus on are social-contract theory, human-rights theory, and theories of governmental coercion. The driving questions here are: What is the origin of governmental authority? What is the main purpose that governments serve? What are the limits to the laws that governments can create?

**The Social Contract**

Business by its very nature is dog-eat-dog, where one company tries to draw customers away from the competition, perhaps to the point of putting the competition out of business. Sometimes efforts to succeed can go too far and involve intentionally sabotaging the competition by stealing trade secrets, publishing misleading attack ads, or even vandalizing property. For example, an owner of a pizza restaurant in Philadelphia was charged with releasing mice into two competing pizzerias. The owner went into the bathroom of one competitor and placed a bag of mice in the drop ceiling. He then crossed the street, entered a second one, and placed another bag of mice into a garbage can. When caught and arrested, he claimed that he was just getting even for his competition doing the same thing to him. Even though business is inherently cutthroat, there are still requirements for civil behavior and limits on how far one can go in defeating the competition. Without those requirements, business competition would descend into gang warfare and ultimately destroy the economic playing field that is required for businesses to even exist.

             This is precisely the rationale behind: To preserve our individual lives, we agree to set aside our hostilities towards each other in exchange for the peace that a civilized society offers. The champion of this view is Thomas Hobbes, who, as we saw earlier, defended the theory of psychological egoism. Hobbes began by having us think about what the world would be like if there were no governments and laws to keep society peaceful. In his words, what would the state of nature be like, where every person was seeking to survive in competition with everyone else, without the protection of the government? His answer was that it would be a condition of war between every person, and two factors make this so. First, life’s necessities are scarce, and it is a constant struggle for us to adequately supply our basic needs like food, clothing, and shelter. Second, we are not by nature generous, and we will not be inclined to share what we have with others.

             As a psychological egoist, Hobbes held that we will always be interested in our own personal interests and that we are not capable of acting towards others with true altruism. If we were capable of acting selflessly, then we would peacefully divide up the scarce resources that we all need. If I find an apple, and then see that you are hungry, I will naturally be inclined to split the apple with you. But, according to Hobbes, our natural inclination towards selfishness prevents us from doing this. The result, then, is that the state of nature is really a state of war, which he vividly describes here:

In such condition there is no place for industry, because the fruit thereof is uncertain, and consequently, no culture of the earth, no navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea, no commodious building, no instruments of moving and removing such things as require much force, no knowledge of the face of the earth, no account of time, no arts, no letters, no society, and which is worst of all, continual fear and danger of violent death, and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.

Within the state of nature, there is no point in my even trying to grow a garden, build a home, or furnish it: Someone would just come along and take it from me by force.

How, then, do we escape from the horrible conditions of the state of nature? The answer for Hobbes was the social contract, which has three steps. First, I must recognize that seeking peace is the best way for me to preserve my life. I will always be selfish, and that will never change. However, I must see that I can better my own situation by seeking peace with my competition. Second, I must negotiate a peace settlement with you: I will set aside my hostilities towards you if you set aside your hostilities towards me. If we mutually agree to be civil to each other, then we will both have the hope of living better lives. Third, we must establish a governmental authority that will punish us if we break our agreement. Talk is cheap, and I can verbally agree to a peace treaty with you but then attack you when your guard is down. And you can do exactly the same thing to me. But if we create a policing power to watch over us, then I will be strongly motivated to hold to my agreement with you, and so will you.

             In the business world, it is essentially a social-contract agreement that keeps us from sabotaging our competitors. Just like the pizza restaurant owner, our natural selfish inclination might be to destroy our competition by any means necessary, but doing so would lead to a savage state of war where we would all be losers. The best business strategy, then, is a negotiated peace settlement where all businesses play by a set of rules. To keep us from cheating on those rules, there are governing bodies such as governments and professional business associations that can punish us when we break them. Business is still motivated by self-interest, but it is now constrained to be civil.

**Human Rights**

The U.S. Civil War was in many ways the result of a business-ethics dispute. The earliest Spanish settlers of North America brought African slaves with them to help cultivate the land and build towns, and slavery quickly became integral to business activities throughout the colonies. By the time of the American Revolution, slavery in the North had declined, partly because of a manufacturing economy where it cost more to own and maintain slaves than the slaves could economically produce. However, in the agricultural economy of the South, slave labor was still cost-effective. As the antislavery movement took hold, Southern slaveholders asked who would compensate them for their financial investment in their slaves if the slaves were to be freed. There were no clear answers to this question, and so the slaveholders saw abolitionism as a direct threat to their economic rights. They saw the North as posturing to steal their property and undermine their capacity to compete in the agricultural marketplace.

             We now see slavery as one of the worst chapters in American history, regardless of the economic arguments of the slaveholders. And even today, we are horrified to hear of slavery-like conditions around the world, where laborers are sometimes kidnapped or otherwise coerced into working in sweatshops or on farms with grueling hours, horrible conditions, and meager pay. We see these as rights violations that can never be morally justified by any economic benefit to the business owner.

             The central idea here is that of a right, which is a justified claim against another person’s behavior. For example, I can rightfully claim that you cannot steal from me, torture me, enslave me, or kill me. I am making a claim about what you can and cannot do. When asserting our various rights, it is important to distinguish between two types:

• Legal rights are those created by governments. The government, for example, has established laws that grant me the right to drive when I reach a certain age, or carry certain types of weapons, or visit publicly owned parks.

• Human rights—also called _natural rights_—are not created by governments but are rights all people around the world have regardless of the country in which they live. The rights against slavery and torture are commonly listed among these.

There are three distinct features of human rights:

• They are _natural_ in the sense that we are born with them. They are not given to us by the government or any other human institution, but are part of our identity by our merely being born as human beings.

• They are _universal_ in that all humans worldwide possess them. No matter who you are or where you live, you have human rights.

• They are _equal_ in the sense that we all have the same list of fundamental human rights, and no one has more or fewer than another person.

The concept of human rights was first developed by the English philosopher John Locke (1632–1704), who argued that by nature everyone has the basic rights to life, health, liberty, and possessions. God gives us these when we are born, and we retain them throughout life, so long as we do not violate the rights of others. For Locke, the right to acquire possessions was the source of our economic freedom and the ability to conduct business transactions. Once I rightfully acquire possessions, I can keep them or sell them as I see fit. However, just as Hobbes warned, the world is a nasty place, and many out there will want to violate my rights and take what I have. According to Locke, we establish governments specifically for the purpose of protecting our fundamental rights: We sub-contract to the government the job of keeping the peace. If the government adequately performs its task of protecting our rights, then we all benefit. If the government fails in that task, however, we have a right to overthrow the government and replace it with a better one that can more adequately do its job.

             Thomas Jefferson, when penning the Declaration of Independence, latched onto this exact part of Locke’s theory:

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. That, to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just Powers from the consent of the governed. That, whenever any form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government.

Through Jefferson, the concept of human rights has become embedded into the American mindset, and it has inspired countries around the world to similarly acknowledge human rights.

But the concept of human rights took its modern form through a document called the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948. The Universal Declaration reiterates the same core set of human rights as Locke and Jefferson: “Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person” (1948, Article 3). However, the document moves beyond these very general rights by listing a range of specific ones, such as these pertaining to businesses:

1. Everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment.

2. Everyone, without any discrimination, has the right to equal pay for equal work.

3. Everyone who works has the right to just and favourable remuneration ensuring for himself and his family an existence worthy of human dignity, and supplemented, if necessary, by other means of social protection.

4. Everyone has the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his interests.

5. Everyone has the right to rest and leisure, including reasonable limitation of working hours and periodic holidays with pay. (Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948, Articles 23–24)

Although not all of the human rights listed in the Universal Declaration have yet become a reality around the world, it is nevertheless the standard towards which all countries within the United Nations have pledged to work.

**Principles of Governmental Coercion**

To effectively compete in the marketplace, businesses are continually pushing the boundaries of tasteful advertising. Presenting shocking and even offensive images in advertisements will attract attention, and may generate sales. A quick online image search for “offensive advertisement” will reveal a range of troubling ads that are sexually explicit, demeaning to women or minority groups, or offensive to religious groups. A case in point is an advertisement by the Italian clothing company Benetton that contained an altered image of the Catholic pope romantically kissing a Muslim imam. In keeping with the company’s theme of multiculturalism, a spokesperson said that “the meaning of this campaign is exclusively to combat the culture of hatred in all its forms” (Rocca, 2011). When the Vatican threatened to sue, Benetton removed the ad.

             While ads like Benetton’s may be offensive to some people, they nevertheless may be perfectly legal. That raises the question of how bad an action needs to be before the government steps in and makes it illegal. All governments are coercive in the sense that they force us to conform to laws under threat of punishment. PepsiCo would not burn down Coca-Cola’s company headquarters, even if it wanted to, because of how the government would punish it. But governments cannot randomly single out some actions as criminal and allow others to be legal. There are reasons why some actions are prohibited and others are not. There are four common justifications of governmental coercion: the harm principle, the offense principle, the principle of legal paternalism, and the principle of legal moralism.

             The first is the harm principle: Governments may restrict our conduct when it harms other people. Burning down Coca-Cola’s headquarters could injure and kill many people, and would undoubtedly cause financial harm to the company. However, for the government to step in and outlaw harmful actions, the injury must be serious, not trivial. For example, almost all fast-food products are harmful in comparison to organic food alternatives. However, serving unhealthy food is far less serious than serving food tainted with salmonella, which causes severe illness and even death. Thus, the government cannot reasonably outlaw fast food, whereas it justifiably can do so with salmonella-tainted food.

             Second is the offense principle: Governments may keep us from offending others. We cannot walk naked through the streets, be publicly intoxicated, or shout obscenities in playgrounds. As with the harm principle, the offense principle also looks at the degree to which a particular action is objectionable: Is it outrageously offensive or merely a nuisance? Benetton’s ad touches on this very issue. It was certainly offensive to specific groups of Catholics and Muslims, but whether it was deeply offensive to society at large is another matter. Again, Benetton’s ad was perfectly legal, which means that in our present cultural climate, it was not offensive enough to be illegal.

             Third is the principle of legal paternalism: Governments may keep me from harming myself. The term “paternalism” comes from that Latin word for father, which implies that the government is overseeing my conduct in the way that parents try to protect their children. This is a sister concept to the harm principle. While the harm principle focuses on the harm our actions cause to other people, legal paternalism looks at the harm that we cause ourselves through our actions and maintains that the government can restrict such conduct. When the government mandates that I wear a seat belt when driving, the concern is principally with protecting me from my own careless conduct. But does the government have any business in doing this? Yet again, the question is one of degree. I can hurt myself by participating in a dangerous sport such as cliff diving or by working in a dangerous occupation such as tree trimming. But most of us feel that these risks do not go far enough to justify governmental interference. However, with our stupidest and most dangerous actions, such as playing Russian roulette with a hand gun, we may want the government to protect us from ourselves and make the action illegal.

             Finally, there is legal moralism: Governments may restrict conduct that is especially sinful or immoral. Prime examples of this are laws against blasphemy and some sex acts, such as sodomy. The question here is not whether a type of conduct is harmful to others, publicly offensive, or harmful to oneself. It is a matter of whether an act, even when done privately, crosses some moral boundary that justifies the government’s stepping in. Of all the principles of governmental coercion, legal moralism is probably the weakest. One reason is that many moral and religious standards vary widely, and by outlawing an action solely on moral or religious grounds, the government may be unfairly adopting the standards of one cultural group and applying them to everyone.

             Although legal moralism may be the weakest of the four principles, some of the others may also be seriously questionable. The British philosopher John Stuart Mill argued that, in fact, only one principle of governmental coercion is justifiable, namely the harm principle. The government has no right to restrict our conduct on the other three grounds. In Mill’s words:

The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant (1859/1999).

The reason, according to Mill, is that a wide sphere of personal liberty is essential for a happy society, and that includes the possibility of offending others, harming ourselves, or crossing some traditional moral boundary. Do we want to decide for ourselves what makes us happy, or do we want the government to do so? From Mill’s perspective, I am a better judge of my own happiness than the government ever could be, and society on the whole will be a happier place when we are each allowed that freedom.

             All of these principles of governmental coercion apply to businesses just as they do to individual people. Again, with Benetton, although their ad was offensive to some groups, the offense was not serious or widespread enough to justify its being illegal. But with many ad campaigns, merely being legal may not be good enough. Public opinion can be as coercive as any government-imposed restriction. If Microsoft, PepsiCo, or any other Fortune 500 company published an ad with the pope kissing a Muslim, the backlash would likely be financially crippling. Catholics and Muslims worldwide might boycott their products. Benetton is a much smaller company, with a specialized market niche and a history of using shocking ads to get consumers’ attention. Not so with Microsoft and PepsiCo, which have much broader customer bases worldwide. With them, consumer coercion is as powerful as governmental coercion.

**CONCLUSION**

In this chapter we have looked at a wide spectrum of classic moral theories and showed how they apply to an equally broad spectrum of business ethics issues. These are moral theories that, 1,000 years from now, will be just as important as they are today; in a sense, they define the moral thought process for humans. The philosophers who proposed these various theories were not always in agreement with each other; in fact, they rejected many rival moral theories. Bentham believed that all moral and social issues should be decided solely using the utilitarian principle, not through theories about religion, virtue, duty, social contracts, or human rights.

             Similarly, Kant believed that the categorical imperative was the single moral litmus test. But exclusive claims like these are much like efforts at brand loyalty in the business world. Walmart would like us to shop at only their stores. Coca-Cola would like us to drink only their beverages. Exxon would like us to buy only their gas. But in the real world, our purchasing habits are more diverse and we are drawn to a range of different stores and products.

             So too with moral theories: In the real world, when we reflect on moral issues, some theories will be more relevant or illuminating than others. Bentham’s utilitarianism may be helpful with some types of moral evaluations, but not with others. The same is true for the other theories that we have examined. We are trapped in a morally complex world that demands that we make moral choices. One way or another we will do that, and drawing on all of the various moral theories can help make the job easier.

             In the following chapters of this book, all of the issues covered can be analyzed using these classic moral theories. As authors, though, we have not forced that approach. Issues such as price fixing, corporate punishment, consumer advocacy, insider trading, and others are challenging enough in their own right, without the added intricacies of a utilitarian or duty-theory analysis. Nevertheless, classic moral theories are always lurking in the background of most of these discussions. Does a particular government regulation serve the greatest good for the greatest number of people? Do affirmative action policies violate the rights of majority groups? Do we have special moral duties to protect the environment? A full evaluation of business-ethics issues may greatly benefit from the contributions of classic moral theories.

             To be sure, many business ethics issues covered in this book are hotly debated, such as the nature of capitalism, corporate personhood, and worker’s rights. However, these debates teach us that some of our most important social and economic values may not be as firmly established as we might think, and we must show respect toward those on the opposite side of the issue. We cannot be good business colleagues—or good citizens for that matter—if we are contentious on value issues where reasonable people may disagree.

**INTRODUCTION**

In the spring of 2000, protestors took to the streets in Bolivia, South America’s poorest country. The reason? The Bolivian government had leased the water rights of several regions in the drought-stricken nation to private companies. One was the U.S. engineering company Bechtel, which agreed to expand and bring efficiency to the water resources of those regions. This meant that all of the area’s water resources fell within its domain, even the gathering of rainwater. Shortly after Bechtel took control, water prices in one city tripled, sparking major protests. The government declared martial law and police were called in, killing at least six protesters and injuring over 170 others. The Bolivian government subsequently canceled the water contract with Bechtel.

             Bechtel was not an inherently evil corporation that intentionally entered Bolivia to extract money from a poverty-stricken population. In their defense, company executives said that the price increases were initiated by the local government, not by them. Bechtel was experienced in the managing of water resources and was simply there to do a job. Nevertheless, the company’s involvement in the privatization of water became a symbol for capitalism’s having gone too far. Once water was privatized, the Bolivians could not even collect rainwater for their own drinking without first obtaining a permit. This appears to be a situation of forcing private market solutions upon what are ultimately public-sector problems. Water access, it seems, is a public right, and when water becomes scarce, the task of managing those resources should fall to the government, whose primary task is to protect the public good.

             At the heart of many issues in business ethics, like the privatization of water, is the economic system under which businesses themselves operate; generally speaking, the two competing economic systems are _capitalism_ and _socialism_. The one looks to the free market, the other to government control. In this chapter, we will look at the tension between these two ideologies, and the ethical implications of adopting one of these systems over the other. We will consider their essential features and the specific theories of their two most famous defenders, Adam Smith and Karl Marx. We will then examine anticompetitive business practices that undermine the free market, and the role of the government in keeping the market competitive.

**CAPITALISM AND SOCIALISM DEFINED**

There are no official definitions of either capitalism or socialism upon which everyone agrees. One reason for this is that these theories are so multifaceted and all-encompassing that they resist being distilled into a single formula. Another reason is that the concepts are at the center of an intense ideological battle, which often makes it difficult to avoid personal bias even with simple formulations of the concepts. Nevertheless, there are recurring themes with both of these notions, which can provide a starting point for discussion.

**Capitalism**

As an economic theory, **capitalism** maintains that

1. personal self-interest, not community interest, motivates economic development;

2. the major sources of society’s economic production should be privately owned, not governmentally owned; and

3. economic planning should be decentralized through market competition, not centralized through government policy.

To clarify, the first point maintains that the engine that drives all business activity is the desire for personal gain. This does not necessarily commit the capitalist to the radical theory of psychological egoism, which states that all human actions are selfishly motivated and that humans are psychologically incapable of performing purely altruistic actions. However, it does imply that, within the arena of business activity, all players do what they do in hopes of financial gain. Whether it is the venture capitalist, the private entrepreneur, the corporate executive, or the worker, the prospect of making money is the carrot that motivates.

             In economics, this idea is expressed in the concept of the profit motive: The ultimate purpose of a commercial enterprise is to earn a profit. That is the reason that businesses exist. According to this view, it is a psychological fact that self-interest motivates economic activity, and from an ethical perspective, that is the way it should be. Throughout history, the flourishing of civilizations has gone hand in hand with vigorous economic activity—craftsmanship, industry, and trade with neighboring countries. Whatever gains societies make through economic development owe at least in part to this kind of self-interest.

             One popular way of expressing this notion is with the idea that greed is good: With life in general and the business world in particular, the human drive of self-interest directs our energy and creativity. The term greed is not the most flattering way of depicting the idea of the profit motive; since the Middle Ages, greed has been listed as one of the seven deadly sins. However, by designating greed as morally “good,” the implication is that this aspect of human nature can be redirected to motivate business activity in a proficient and positive way. In the words of the character Gordon Gekko in the movie Wall Street, “Greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right. Greed works. Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit”.

             The second tenet of capitalism is that the major sources of society’s economic production should be privately owned, not governmentally owned. This includes land, raw materials, factories, retail stores, transportation services, communication networks, and any other major component of a country’s economy. According to capitalists, all of these things function better when owned and operated by private individuals or organizations than when owned by the government. Part of the reason for this is efficiency: If you own your own business, you will be personally motivated to do everything in your power to succeed. You will be responsive to the needs and demands of consumers; if you are not, you risk going out of business. With government ownership, that element of personal interest is stripped away.

             Another justification for private ownership is the very notion of the moral right to private property: The businesses that we create are part of our personal property, and we are entitled to keep them. While the political concept of the natural right to property is only about three centuries old, the human sense of entitlement to personal property is much older and part of human nature itself. At the purely animalistic level, it is a manifestation of territoriality, in the same way that birds own their nests and beavers own their dams. The Italian philosopher Niccolò Machiavelli vividly encapsulated the zeal we have for private property: A political ruler “must keep his hands off the property of others, because people more quickly forget the death of their father than the loss of their inheritance”. According to capitalists, a government’s taking away our private property is one of the greatest moral violations.

             Concerning the third point of capitalism, that economic planning should be decentralized through market competition, this is the basic idea of free market economics. That is, businesses should be governed by the laws of supply and demand, not restrained by government interference. The idea of competition in a free market is often compared with the evolutionary notion of survival of the fittest. With the evolutionary notion, species with the best adaptations, such as long claws, win out over rival species that are less well adapted, such as those with shorter claws. The losers die out and the winners live to compete against future rivals. In business, companies are best adapted to a competitive marketplace when they can offer a higher quality product for a cheaper price. Companies that are nimble and can quickly seize new market opportunities are the ones that will survive; the losers will go out of business. In the process, products improve, consumers are happier, jobs are created, and wealth is generated. Contrast that with a situation where governments control or severely restrict business production and the ability to compete against rivals. Prices would remain fixed, quality would stagnate, and responsiveness to consumer demands would be low. According to capitalists, governments should simply stay out of the marketplace—as indicated by the adopted French expression laissez-faire, “leave it alone.”

**Socialism**

We turn now to the concept of socialism, which holds the exact opposite of the three tenets of capitalism mentioned previously. That is,

1. community interest, not personal self-interest, should motivate economic development;

2. the major sources of society’s economic production should be governmentally owned, not privately owned; and

3. economic planning should be centralized through government policy, not decentralized through market competition.

Regarding the first point, socialists do not deny the place that self-interest holds in human motivation. We are clearly selfish creatures at many levels, and some of that selfishness may be unavoidable. However, we are not at our best when our actions are dominated by selfish inclinations and we behave more like animals. Within human nature there is another drive—a community-oriented one—that better reflects our true human character. Virtually every political philosopher for the past 2,500 years has acknowledged the social character of human nature: We cannot survive on our own, and we require a community of diverse members to meet our survival needs. We are not lone survivalists, fending for ourselves in the untamed wild; in fact, the human species was never like that. For the vast majority of our 500,000-year existence as a species, we lived in tribes as hunter-gatherers. These were small groups, typically extended families, and most tribal activity focused on the survival of the community. The concept of “every man for himself” did not make much sense in that context. It was only with the emergence of city life 12,000 years ago, during the agricultural revolution, that the opportunity even arose for an economic system that could be driven by personal greed.

             That chapter of human history has not been a pretty one. Land and other resources have been plundered, workers have been exploited and enslaved. These and other morally heinous acts are the regular consequence of an economic system dominated by self-interest. Socialism, by contrast, involves shaping an economic system in a way that is more consistent with our community interests.

             The second tenet of socialism is that the major sources of society’s economic production should be governmentally owned, not privately owned. Private ownership of the economic base leads to the accumulation of wealth in the hands of a few powerful owners and the degeneration of society into a system of those who have and those who have not. The socialist writer Pierre-Joseph Proudhon made the famous statement that “property is theft,” by which he meant that business owners steal profits from the workers. Workers are the ones who essentially create the wealth, but they are coerced into a working situation where they reap almost none of the rewards. To that extent, it is much like slavery. Further, with regard to private ownership, socialists believe that owners have too much control over how they manage their property, and that they can act in ways that harm society as a whole. Owners can wipe out natural resources, such as timber and even water. They can take the best land for themselves, leaving nothing of value to the masses of the poor. They can sell off the nation’s food supply to foreign markets if that becomes profitable. All of these ethical abuses of property cease when the property is owned and managed by a government that sees its mission as the betterment of society as a whole, including all of the social classes it contains.

             The third tenet of socialism is that economic planning should be centralized through government policy, not decentralized through market competition. Consider again the “survival of the fittest” metaphor of market competition. What capitalists emphasize is the lower prices and higher quality of goods that result from competition. What they sweep under the carpet, according to socialists, are the more negative aspects of survival of the fittest. For every winner there is a loser, and when a company goes under, it is the army of unemployed workers who suffer the most. They often have no financial safety net in the way that wealthy business owners do, and they often need to uproot their families and relocate in hopes of finding other employment. Further, when competition is stiff, there is pressure for a business to survive at all costs; owners will continually find creative ways to cheat, either in direct violation of laws or with unethical tactics that stay just one step ahead of lawmakers. All of these ethical problems are eliminated when a government itself plans the economy in response to consumer needs. Rather than have businesses claw each other to death as they fight to dominate every new consumer market, the government addresses those needs in an orderly way that causes the least amount of social upheaval.

             Again, these descriptions of capitalism and socialism express recurring themes in these ideologies, and different proponents will have their own points of emphasis. Two economists are associated with the opposing systems of capitalism and socialism, namely Adam Smith (1723–1790) and Karl Marx (1818–1883). No capitalist or socialist accepts as truth every point that these thinkers made. But their writings are still held in almost scriptural reverence, and long after the words of contemporary defenders of those rival ideologies are forgotten, the writings of Smith and Marx will remain as blueprints for the economic systems that they forged. We will look at highlights of their respective views next, particularly ones that are as relevant today as they were in the two men’s lifetimes.

**ADAM SMITH’S CAPITALISM**

The Scottish philosopher Adam Smith was a professor of moral philosophy at the University of Glasgow and the author of two important works in ethics and economics: The _Theory of Moral Sentiments_ (1759) and _An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations_ (1776). Although Smith’s theory of capitalism is detailed, there are three concepts central to it:

1. The economy is driven by selfish desire for luxury goods;

2. economic balance is achieved through a self-regulating invisible hand; and

3. the government’s role in a nation’s economic system should be limited.

We will look at each of these concepts

**Selfish Desire for Luxury Goods**

Selfishness, according to Smith, is a fundamental driving force of human conduct. Although Smith did not go so far as to say that every human action arises from selfish motives, he believed that selfishness is the foundation of an important segment of our public actions. It drives each person to take “proper care of his health, his life, or his fortune,” which are among the most important moral duties that we owe to ourselves (Smith, 1759/1982, 4.2.3). It is also the fundamental motive that determines how we acquire from others what we need for our survival and success. I cannot survive on my own, and my most basic needs for food can only be met through the cooperation of others. To get you to help me, though, I cannot rely on your kindness. Rather, I must find some way for you to personally benefit before you will consider assisting me. Smith wrote:

Give me that which I want, and you shall have this which you want, is the meaning of every such offer; and it is in this manner that we obtain from one another the far greater part of those good offices which we stand in need of. It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages. (WON 1.2)

To get what I need, it will always come down to the old adage that I will scratch your back if you scratch mine.

             Just as selfishness drives me to acquire life’s necessities, it also motivates me to acquire luxuries, improve my position in society, and climb the ladder of financial success. According to Smith, a poor person envies the easy and comfortable lifestyles of the rich, wants that for him- or herself, and works diligently and with great difficulty to acquire it. The person devotes years to education, acquires a marketable skill, and struggles to build up a client base, often working for people he or she hates. Throughout life, the person is driven by the selfish belief that achieving an opulent life with wealth and disposable luxury goods will bring happiness. The fact is that it will not necessarily make the person happier, and in the end the person will probably be more miserable for all those efforts: “Through the whole of his life he pursues the idea of a certain artificial and elegant repose which he may never arrive at, for which he sacrifices a real tranquility that is at all times in his power”.

             Smith’s point is that we naturally desire luxury items that appear to be a means of happiness, and thus we block out the thoughts of toil and misery that go along with acquiring and maintaining those things. If it looks like it will make our lives happier, we will want it and pursue it, even if on balance that effort will make us unhappier. It is this desire for luxury that drives the economy, and the irony is that it is grounded in a natural deception. Smith wrote:

It is this deception which rouses and keeps in continual motion the industry of mankind. It is this which first prompted them to cultivate the ground, to build houses, to found cities and commonwealths, and to invent and improve all the sciences and arts, which ennoble and embellish human life; which have entirely changed the whole face of the globe. (TMS, 4.1)

In sum, selfishness motivates our desire for both necessities and luxuries, and we get what we desire only by appealing to the selfishness of others. Also, the selfish desire for luxuries is what drives the whole economy.

**The Invisible Hand**

The second component of Smith’s theory is perhaps what he is most famous for, namely the idea that by pursuing our self-interest, we indirectly promote the good of society as if directed by an invisible hand. There is a natural tendency towards self-regulation in economic systems, which creates economic balance within society. Smith used the expression “invisible hand” only twice in his economic writings, emphasizing a different point each time. First he described how the wealth of the rich will be automatically distributed to poor workers. As we accumulate our wealth, there is still only a limited amount that any one person can consume, and the remainder of that wealth will ultimately make its way to workers who make our wealth and lifestyle possible. He wrote:

[The rich] consume little more than the poor, and in spite of their natural selfishness and rapacity . . . they divide with the poor the produce of all their improvements. They are led by an invisible hand to make nearly the same distribution of the necessaries of life, which would have been made, had the earth been divided into equal portions among all its inhabitants, and thus without intending it, without knowing it, advance the interest of the society, and afford means to the multiplication of the species. When providence divided the earth among a few lordly masters, it neither forgot nor abandoned those who seemed to have been left out in the partition. These last too enjoy their share of all that it produces. (TMS, 4.1)

According to this view, economic growth flows down from the top to the bottom, indirectly benefiting those at the bottom. To support their luxurious lifestyles, the rich need a network of workers to produce goods and provide services. This occurs when, for example, a rich farmer employs laborers to grow crops and maintain the property. It also occurs when the farmer buys luxury goods, thereby giving work to carpenters, clothiers, artists, and book publishers who might live a hundred miles away or more. This automatic spreading of wealth throughout society is an important moral good.

             Smith’s other description of the invisible hand involves international trade; he supported what we now call free trade, namely the concept that trade across national boundaries should take place without interference from the respective governments. In Smith’s day, as now, individual countries typically tried to acquire more wealth than rival countries. The formula for doing this is to increase one’s exports while, at the same time, decreasing one’s imports. Governments have used a range of protectionist policies to achieve these goals, such as placing taxes and caps on imported items. Smith rejected these protectionist policies and argued that if we just allow businesses to follow their own self-interest, their country’s economy as a whole will improve. I, as a businessperson, know that my company will perform better when the economy of the whole country thrives. I will thus be naturally inclined to support the domestic economy, even when my principal aim is to increase my own business. Smith wrote:

By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good. (WON 1.2)

Although these are the only two instances where Smith used the expression “invisible hand,” in this quote he indicated that “in many other cases” the concept of the invisible hand applies, and a larger moral and social benefit is achieved when we pursue our own interests.

**Limited Role of Government**

The third component of Smith’s theory is that, although the presence of government is sometimes necessary in the economic development of a society, its role should be limited and, when possible, it should allow private industries to assume tasks. Governments often take on the kind of activities that private industries and organizations do. They own and operate post offices, energy services, water utilities, transportation networks, educational institutions, and even religious establishments. Smith argued that there are three fundamental duties of governments, and that beyond those, private industries are better suited to take on tasks. The first governmental duty is defense, the use of military force to protect society from violence and attack from rival countries. The more advanced the society is, the more expensive its weaponry will be, and there is no avoiding those costs to the public. The government’s second duty is to run a judicial system that protects “every member of the society from the injustice or oppression of every other member of it” (WON). The costs of running a judicial system, Smith argued, can to a large extent be defrayed through court fees.

             Even among the most extreme critics of big government, there is little dispute about the government’s fundamental role in defending the country and operating a judicial system. However, according to Smith, there is yet a third area of legitimate government involvement, and that involves public works and institutions that are of great benefit to society but too unprofitable to be taken on through private industry. These, according to Smith, fall into three categories:

             First, there are public works and institutions that are necessary for businesses to operate effectively, including the creation of roadways, bridges, harbors, and other parts of the transportation infrastructure. Smith also mentioned post offices and foreign embassies as institutions that are essential for commerce. Much of the cost of these commerce-based projects can be covered through tolls and user fees, without placing a burden on general public funds.

             Second, there are government programs devoted to public education. The government has a strong interest in educating “inferior ranks of people,” who, Smith said, seem to be “mutilated and deformed in a still more essential part of the character of human nature” (WON 5.1.3). Through education, people will be less prone to superstition, and therefore to public disorder. Also, when properly educated, the masses are “less apt to be misled into any wanton or unnecessary opposition to the measures of government” (WON, 5.1.3). Costs of public education, Smith argued, can be paid for through student fees or educational endowments.

             Third, there are public institutions that are responsible for religious instruction. The United Kingdom, in Smith’s day as now, had a state-funded religion, namely the Church of England. Smith’s view on the public funding of religion was rather radical. The worst part about religion, he argued, is that it perpetuates fanaticism, superstition, and civil unrest. State-supported religions are particularly bad at this, he argued, and the United Kingdom’s state-run church was responsible for the deaths of thousands through religious persecutions. According to Smith, religion would be more moderate if churches were run privately in a competitive free market, where each church would of necessity learn to be tolerant of its rivals. Although state religions should be abolished, according to Smith, the government should create programs to reduce religious superstition even further. For example, the educated class could be required to study science, which, he said, “is the great antidote to the poison of enthusiasm and superstition.” The government should also publicly fund “painting, poetry, music, dancing” and other forms of art that Smith believed help remove the gloominess of religious fanaticism (WON, 5.1.3).

             All three of these roles of government, according to Smith, aim at enhancing the well-being of society in ways that private industries are incapable of doing by themselves.

**KARL MARX’S SOCIALISM**

Born in Germany, Karl Marx was trained as a philosopher, but he is best remembered as a political activist and champion of the theory of communism, a radical form of socialism that aims to abolish all social classes, private property, and even government. Although Marx was a prolific writer, his two most famous works are _The Communist Manifesto_ (1848), a document calling for workers to launch a revolution, and _Capital_ (1867–1894), which critiques the capitalist economic system. Like Smith’s theory, Marx’s view of socialism is detailed, but there are three main features of it that we will examine: First, in a capitalist system, workers are alienated from their labor; second, in capitalism, there is a class struggle between the working class and the business owners; and third, workers must improve their situation by revolting against capitalist forces in society.

**Alienated Labor**

Like Smith, Marx believed that egoism is a strong motivating force for people’s conduct and that people are naturally driven to seek their own benefit in economic matters. But, he argued, our egoistic tendencies are a distortion of a more inner and essential part of human nature that is community oriented. Through our community nature, our choices and actions are connected with others around us, not in conflict with others. But according to Marx, capitalist societies and economic systems have embraced the egoistic, dog-eat-dog part of human nature, and this egoism is evident in the so-called natural rights that countries like the United States and France have embraced.

             Marx argued that when our entire social and economic systems are directed towards egoistic needs, then we as individual people become fractured and alienated from our inner community nature. This is most evident in how the vast majority of workers are forced into job environments in which they become mere tools for the egoistic benefit of the owners. Take a typical factory job. I need money to survive, and my only employment opportunity requires me to labor in a textile factory, performing specific tasks on a textile loom all day, all for the financial benefit of the owner. Although I get paid, I have no choice in what I do, no personal stake or say in what happens to the products that I make, and, most importantly, no opportunity to connect my labor to the community in a meaningful way. This is Marx’s notion of alienated labor: I become alienated from my true inner nature when I am forced to give my labor away to the factory owner. Workers have nothing left to sell to survive but their own labor. Marx argued that this is much like prostitution: Out of financial desperation, the prostitute sells off a critical part of her identity that she would other- wise reserve for the intimate bonding with her spouse. In a more perfect economic environment, I would not be coerced into prostituting my labor for a measly paycheck. I would be more in control of what I produce and how I use my labor to bond with the larger community.

             For Marx, here is what happens when our labor is not alienated and, instead, our job routines are in accord with our true community nature. Suppose that I have a cottage industry in which I design and manufacture shirts within my house. First, when I produce a shirt through my labor, I impose my creative identity on the world. Who I am as a person in some sense becomes transformed into the physical world, and I can take pleasure in seeing the physical expression of my creative personality with my own two eyes. Second, when you need a shirt and buy it from me, I can take pleasure in the fact that I have satisfied a specific human need that you have. Third, I become the social mediator between you and your human need, and because of that you acknowledge my role in completing a necessary part of your identity. Finally, the shirt that you now wear becomes part of your identity. Through the creative expression of my life, then, “I would have directly created your expression of your life”.

             The end result is that through my creative expression, I connect with my community. In Marx’s words, “in my individual activity I would have directly _confirmed_ and _realized_ my true nature, my _human nature_, my _communal nature_” (1844). The financial exchange between you and me will still be part of the transaction, and I will still need your money in order to survive. However, the financial component will be more of a secondary issue, and the primary issues of our transaction will be self-expression and community bonding. This removes the alienation of labor and places economic transactions on a higher moral level.

             Even today we see this community bonding with craftspeople who have a love for their trade and enjoy sharing their goods with others. But this unalienated approach to labor is very difficult to achieve in modern capitalist and industrial work environments. Businesses do what they can to get their workers to identify with their products and the benefit that they bring to society. The more hierarchical terms _employee_ and _supervisor_ have commonly been replaced with the more group-oriented terms team member and team leader. In a sense, this acknowledges Marx’s assessment of worker psychology: We do not want to feel like prostitutes in our jobs, and we want some creative input. The critical issue, though, is whether the reality of one’s job can live up to the managerial jargon of “team member- ship,” which Marx would undoubtedly say it cannot do.

**Class Struggle**

Within the typical capitalist system, then, workers are coerced into prostituting their labor, they are alienated from their true communal nature, and, as a result, they are very unhappy. This leads to the next major component of Marx’s theory: class struggle.

             Throughout history, societies have evolved through conflicts between the social classes of those who do the work and those who are in charge and benefit from that work. The class conflicts that occurred throughout history were not simple ones involving bad worker attitudes; rather, they often resulted in great social upheavals and revolutions. Marx wrote:

The history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggles. Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary re-constitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes (1848/1967).

For Marx, the class struggles throughout history revealed a very noticeable pattern between oppressors and the oppressed workers. In Roman times there was a major class struggle between masters and slaves. Tensions grew, which included slave rebellions, and in time, that system of slavery was replaced by a slightly different social hierarchy in the Middle Ages, between nobles and serfs. That tension was eventually replaced during the Renaissance with the emergence of the middle class. But the oppression still continued, as the middle class gained financial strength and formed a capitalist economic system that continued to oppress workers.

             Marx witnessed firsthand the 19th-century industrial revolution, which radically transformed the manufacturing of coal, iron, textile, and glass. This was the first time that non-aristocrat business owners controlled major industries, and to that extent, it was a social triumph. However, this new class of large-scale business owners—the _bourgeoisie_, as Marx called them—were as oppressive to workers as previous members of the ruling class had been. Working conditions were ghastly, pay was minuscule, and workers had next to no political representation. Charles Dickens’s novels, such as _Hard Times_, give us a glimpse of the oppressive working conditions during the 19th century that Marx was reacting against. In many ways, the economic realities of the industrial revolution made working conditions even worse for workers than they had been in previous eras. Manufacturing facilities became larger and, through division of labor, work tasks became more tedious:

Owing to the extensive use of machinery and to division of labor, the work of the proletarians has lost all individual character, and consequently, all charm for the workman. He becomes an appendage of the machine, and it is only the most simple, most monotonous, and most easily acquired skill, that is required of him. Hence, the cost of production of a workman is restricted, almost entirely, to the means of subsistence that he requires for his maintenance, and for the propagation of his race (Marx, 1848/1967).

Workers must sell themselves for the performance of these tedious tasks and become one more commodity in the economic system. Like articles of commerce, they are “exposed to all the risks of competition, to all the fluctuations of the market” (Marx, 1848/1967). The situation for workers gets progressively worse as their value in the market decreases.

**Revolution**

Marx argued that the time for change had come, and in the next phase of social progress, workers would once more rise up against their oppressors. But this time it would be different. In previous phases of social history, changes in hierarchy did not end oppression: The bosses changed, but the exploitation of workers remained the same. With this next phase, the workers would overthrow the ruling class, seize control of the economy, and destroy the institution of private property, which has always been the principal source of exploitation.

             For Marx, the long-term goal of the revolution was communism, which, as indicated before, involves the creation of a society without private property, class division, or government. To achieve that ultimate goal, however, Marx argued that after the revolution, society must go through a transitional phase of socialism where the government takes control of major economic resources within society and enacts policies to reduce class distinctions between the rich and poor. Marx recognized that the ruling class would be horrified at the idea of revolutionaries abolishing private property, but, he continued, in existing capitalist societies, “private property is already done away with for nine-tenths of the population” (1848/1967). The abolition of private property cannot come about through reforms of existing governmental policies, since governments are so embedded with the interests of the ruling class. Only a full-scale revolution will make it possible—one country at a time. This, he believed, is inevitable.

             Once the working class has control, Marx argued, the process of abolishing private property will differ somewhat from country to country, but the more advanced countries will follow a common path. That is, a transitional system of socialism will be put in place, which, step by step, will dis- mantle the social framework of capitalism and replace it with a more community-oriented set of policies. Here, in Marx’s words (1848/1967), are the steps that he envisioned, now referred to as the Ten Planks of Communism:

1. Abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes.

2. A heavy progressive or graduated income tax.

3. Abolition of all right of inheritance.

4. Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels.

5. Centralization of credit in the hands of the State, by means of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly.

6. Centralization of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the State.

7. Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the State; the bringing into cultivation of waste-lands, and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan.

8. Equal liability of all to labor. Establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture.

9. Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries; gradual abolition of the distinction between town and country, by a more equable distribution of the population over the country.

10. Free education for all children in public schools. Abolition of children’s factory labor in its present form. Combination of education with industrial production, etc.

The socialist revolution, as Marx envisioned it, constitutes a thorough moral transformation of society that eliminates the alienation and oppression of workers and makes social benefits available to all people equally. For Marx, when the residue of capitalism has been thoroughly scrubbed away, society will enter an era of true communism. All class distinctions will disappear, since there will no longer be a class of workers that is distinct from a class of owners. Without private property, economic conflict will also disappear, at which point the government’s role in social organization will become unnecessary and the government will eventually die out.

**ASSESSMENT OF CAPITALISM AND SOCIALISM**

The theories of capitalism and socialism have both been hotly debated since they were first forged; we will look at some of the standard criticisms of each. As complex as both theories are, we cannot expect simple criticisms to decisively refute either of them. Further, over time, defenders of both theories have attempted to address problems posed by critics and revise their theories accordingly. Those revised theories are often even more resilient to standard attacks. Nevertheless, general criticisms do reveal potential weak links in the theories.

**Criticisms of Capitalism**

The fundamental criticism of capitalism is that competitive markets have a built-in bias towards private interests rather than public ones. There are several manifestations of this bias. First, capitalism leads to dramatic economic inequality and introduces class divisions between the rich and poor, which is precisely what was of concern to Marx. Second, it is a system in which the worker’s labor is a commodity to be bought and sold, which often leads to dreadful working conditions. It is true that many companies today realize the value of people and have spent considerable effort and research to create job satisfaction. Nevertheless, job satisfaction remains low among workers in unskilled and semiskilled jobs, such as laborers, packagers, food preparers, cashiers, stockers, and servers. And for many workers in foreign countries who manufacture products sold in the United States, their situation is not much different from that of laborers in Marx’s day.

             Third, it fosters environmental destruction and has no built-in incentive for environmental stewardship. Fourth, it tends to be politically undemocratic by enabling large businesses to use their enormous wealth to lobby the government against consumer interests in favor of their own financial well-being. Fifth, it cannot be trusted to shape national policy in the interests of the public, as witnessed by the elimination of public transportation systems throughout the United States and the movement of manufacturing facilities overseas. Sixth, it creates antisocial motivations in both buyers and sellers. Buyers take advantage of return policies and are quick to sue companies for even honest mistakes. Sellers mislead buyers about the quality of their products and services. Buyer and seller become more like adversaries in the market, rather than partners. There are countless examples of how capitalism is inherently in tension with moral responsibility to the public, and most of the problems and famous examples covered in this book arise from that tension. In a sense, the entire study of business ethics is a testament to the fundamental problems of capitalism.

**Criticisms of Socialism**

Turning next to socialism, we find three main criticisms. First, we cannot restrain our motivations of personal self-interest in the manner that socialists advise. Although socialists agree that it is impossible to fully eradicate human selfishness, they recommend subduing it to the point that our community-oriented motivations guide how we develop society’s institutions and economic structure. But even that might be asking too much. Personal self-interest drives us to devote time and energy to better our situation, and without some substantial personal reward, we might not be willing to devote that kind of effort to the greater social good. Personal ambition has been at the forefront of technological innovation and personal progress, and socialists have not adequately explained how we can transfer that drive to public interests.

             A second and related criticism of socialism concerns the difficulty in significantly scaling back on private property, as more extreme socialists advise. Like human selfishness, property owner- ship is deeply ingrained in human nature—even monks, who take vows of poverty and live their entire lives in communal monasteries, still own their own toothbrushes. In a sense, socialists attempt to impose a prehistoric model of communal society on modern economy. According to socialists, just as primitive tribes held their major resources in common, so too should we in modern society hold ours in common. But according to critics, the fit does not work very well in the modern setting. We have moved beyond our hunter-gatherer roots, and through the complex demands of urbanization, we have reinvented ourselves and found a new way to flourish based on harnessing our private desires for wealth and property. The tie that binds together tribal societies is daily contact with each other; the life and activity of one tribe member immediately overlaps with those of others, like a large family. But modern society is too large to be like a real family; it is a mere abstract concept that does not allow for the same bonding experience that is possible in small tribal groups. As the size of society grows, so too does our impulse towards private property.

             Finally, socialist policies of centralized planning are ineffective ways of structuring the economy, as the failed efforts of the former Soviet Union with centralized planning teach us. Banking, industrial production, and distribution of goods and services were organized and carried out based on a master plan devised by the Soviet government. The principal problem with such centralization is inefficiency: It creates unpredictable deficiencies and surpluses. As hard as the Soviet government tried to predict how much bread or toilet paper its citizens needed on a daily or weekly basis, there would nevertheless be great deficiencies in some cities on some days and great surpluses in others. Breadlines were a common occurrence, where people would stand outside a bread store all night to buy as much bread as permitted the next morning before supplies ran out.

**Moderate Versions**

These are just some of the standard arguments against both socialism and capitalism, and again, defenders of each of these ideologies certainly have rebuttals. But when assessing the respective merits of both ideologies, it is important to recognize that there are both extreme and moderate versions of each, which fall along a spectrum from the most extreme capitalism to the most extreme socialism. Very few theorists espouse the most extreme versions, and in the real world, very few if any countries have ever implemented their economies in such extreme ways. Adam Smith himself recognized the need for the government’s involvement in the national economy, such as to provide armies, roads, and schools and to undertake certain commercial ventures. Marx himself acknowledged that during the transitional period of socialism, there still would be some private ownership of the country’s economic base.

             More moderate versions of capitalism and socialism each aim to allow at least some market- based economy while at the same time providing a social safety net to citizens. One such position on the capitalist side of the spectrum is welfare capitalism, a term that originally referred to social-welfare services provided by employers in the early 20th century, such as paid vacations, medical benefits, and pensions. More recently it has come to refer to economic systems that are capitalistic but have social programs that the government runs, such as national health care and government-run child care.

             On the socialist side there is market socialism. This term originally referred to worker-owned cooperative enterprises that operate within free-market systems but are set up in ways that prevent worker exploitation. Today it refers to economic systems that are socialist in terms of government ownership and control of major economic enterprises, but at the same time incorporate some capitalist policies, such as relying on supply and demand in the market to set prices.

             Just as there are a variety of theoretical models of both capitalism and socialism, in the real world there are a variety of capitalist and socialist systems throughout the world. There is a benefit to this variety, in that each country functions like a laboratory experiment in economic policy that others through- out the world can observe and learn from. What are the failures and successes of these countries, and how might this knowledge help us improve our system?

**ANTICOMPETITIVE PRACTICES**

Economists classify the economic system of the United States as a type of welfare capitalism, similar to those of Australia and the United Kingdom. For countries like the United States that are committed to capitalism as an economic system, efforts are needed to keep the marketplace competitive and fair, and to prevent the free market itself from being destroyed. We will look at some of the most notorious anticompetitive business practices that must be guarded against.

**Monopolies and Oligopolies**

A natural outcome of competition in the marketplace is the emergence of monopolies, where a single company controls all or nearly all of the market for a given type of product or service. Sup- pose that a new market opens up for a 3-D TV, and 10 companies manufacture the product. In the normal course of competition, some companies will go under for having inferior technology or poor marketing. Other companies will merge, and in time, only one may be left standing. This scenario has played out again and again in the last few centuries, with notable examples from the past including Western Union, Standard Oil, U.S. Steel, and AT&T controlling the telegraph, petroleum, steel, and telephone markets, respectively. In more recent years, we have seen movement towards monopolies with De Beers and the diamond trade, Microsoft and computer operating systems, and Monsanto and the commercial seed market.

             What, though, is so bad about monopolies? If a company wins fairly in its battle for market share, does it not deserve its position of dominance? Critics argue that monopolies destroy the very competitive markets that first created them, and in the process they eliminate the two key benefits of a capitalist economic system. That is, competition is no longer present to drive down prices and improve quality. For example, when AT&T dominated the telephone industry, prices were comparatively higher than they were after the company was forced to break up, and consumers had fewer options than after the breakup. Imagine what using the phone would be like today if AT&T were the only game in town. The almost infinite variety of cellular-phone applications that we have come to rely on would likely be only futuristic dreams.

             But the companies accused of holding monopolies tell a different story. In the 2001 court case against Microsoft, for example, the software company argued that its dominance in the market had enhanced rather than harmed the innovation process throughout the entire software industry. Consumers, it argued, had also benefited from the low price of its operating system, its free applications, and the impact Microsoft had had in accelerating computer-software innovation more generally. It would be difficult to demonstrate that all monopolies will lead to a decrease in innovation and higher prices; however, there is a realistic fear that at least some monopolies will do so, and that is enough to make a monopoly a potentially anticompetitive practice.

             Similar to a monopoly is an oligopoly, where the market is dominated by a small number of businesses that collectively exert control over that market’s supply and prices. The petroleum, telecommunication, automobile, and soft-drink industries are the clear examples, but with other products, oligopolies are more concealed. There are, for example, dozens of national brands of laundry detergents on the market, but the vast majority are produced by only three companies. As with monopolies, the question remains whether the dominance of an oligopoly in a given market will of necessity harm innovation and result in higher prices.

             Two mechanisms that can lead to both monopolies and oligopolies are mergers and acquisitions. A merger is when two companies of roughly the same size agree to combine as equals to form a new company. An example is the 1989 merger of Time Inc. with Warner Communications to create Time Warner, one of the world’s largest media companies. An acquisition, by contrast, is when a larger company buys a smaller company, which is then swallowed up and loses its identity within the larger one. Nothing is inherently anti-competitive about mergers and acquisitions, and they are in fact a normal part of business transactions. But when these mechanisms are used repeatedly within a given market and produce monopolies and oligopolies, they may create a potentially anticompetitive situation.

**Price Fixing, Bid Rigging, and Price Gouging**

Whereas monopolies and oligopolies are only _potentially_ anticompetitive, other business practices are anticompetitive by their nature and are both unethical and illegal. One such practice is price fixing, where business competitors conspire to set their prices at a fixed point. In usual cases, the businesses set their product prices high; without cheaper alternatives available, consumers are forced to buy at the high price. Price fixing often occurs in markets that are dominated by oligopolies, where the small number of competitors makes it easier to enter into price-fixing agreements.  A recent dramatic example of this was a price-fixing conspiracy between around a dozen manufacturers of LCD screens for computers and televisions. From 1999 and 2006, it is alleged that senior-level executives from these companies—which included Samsung, Sharp, Toshiba, LG, Hitachi—secretly met, exchanged information and agreed on the prices at which each company would sell their products. In all, they sold around $70 billion in price-fixed panels world-wide, which were then purchased by many of the top-name electronics companies and used as components in their computers and televisions. The artificially-inflated prices of these products were then passed on to consumers. The LCD manufacturers agreed to a financial settlement that totaled $1.1 billion.

             A variation on price fixing is bid rigging, where competing businesses agree that one of them will place a bid on a contract at a predetermined price. Often this is done in rotation, where the conspiring businesses take turns offering the lowest bid. A notable case involved several dozen electrical equipment companies, including General Electric and Westinghouse, which engaged in a bid-rigging conspiracy during the 1950s for products such as power transformers and genera- tors. Every 4 weeks, the companies would rotate who would place the lowest bid, ensuring that each would have a turn. What gave them away was that many of the high bids were identical to each other, which would not likely occur by accident. In one case, 12 of the bids quoted the same delivery price, despite the fact that driving distances from the respective factories varied greatly. In total, 29 companies were found guilty in this “Great Conspiracy,” as it was called, and 30 executives received jail sentences. In addition to criminal fines, customers brought over 2,000 lawsuits against the companies, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in damages.

             A final type of unfair competitive practice is price gouging, which occurs when a business sells a product for a price that is much higher than is considered reasonable or fair or sustainable in a truly competitive environment. Price gouging often occurs when there are too few competitors in a given market, which would otherwise drive prices down. The pharmaceutical industry is notorious for this, and two factors make it particularly so:

• _Drug patents grant a temporary monopoly_. When a company produces a new drug, it is granted a legal monopoly on the sale and manufacture of it for approximately 10 years. In many cases—with breakthrough drugs—there is no competition whatsoever. The purpose of drug patents is to encourage innovation by financially rewarding companies that invest in the research and development of new drugs. But the patent itself creates a temporary monopoly until the formula is released into the public domain, when competitors can make generic versions of it.

• _Demand for a product does not change according to the price_. With normal products, price and demand are directly connected. If I charge $100 for a can of cola, the demand for my product will be very low. But if I charge 5 cents per can, demand will be high. Economists call this relation elasticity. But with pharmaceuticals, the relation between price and demand is inelastic: If I need a drug to stay alive, price is no consideration. Whether it costs 5 cents a pill or $100 a pill, I will pay for it.

Here are a few examples. When the AIDS epidemic emerged in the mid-1980s, the first available treatment was the antiretroviral drug AZT, which came with an initial price tag of $7,000 a year. After intense pressure by HIV-advocacy groups, that price was eventually lowered to $3,000. The manufacturer justified the original cost on a couple grounds. First, it was initially approved for a comparatively small market of 50,000 patients who were seriously ill with AIDS—although it was later approved for anyone who tested HIV positive. Second, since AZT was not a cure and would only delay death by about 1 year, the market was literally short-lived.

             Another case involved the tranquilizer Valium. The active ingredient cost the manufacturer $50 a kilogram. They sold to subsidiaries at $23,000 a kilogram, and eventually to customers at the equivalent of $50,000 a kilogram. A third case involved an antiworm drug for sheep called levamisole, manufactured by Johnson and Johnson. When new research found that the drug was an effective treatment for colon cancer, the company made it available in drug stores at a cost to patients of around $1,200 a year, whereas farmers could buy the same quantity for their sheep for $15. The research linking levamisole with colon cancer treatment was funded by the federal government at a cost of $11 million, and the research was freely given to the drug company. In all of these cases, the monopoly on the drug allowed the manufacturer to dramatically inflate prices, with full knowledge that desperate patients would still pay them.

**REGULATING THE FREE MARKET**

To preserve a truly competitive state within the free market, the government must sometimes step in to prevent anticompetitive practices and unfairness. The free market is not so much a natural state of affairs for business transactions, but is instead more like a game where participants agree to follow established rules and the government stands by like an umpire to assure that the process runs smoothly. To that extent, a pure capitalist system does not seem possible; any functioning free market will involve government intervention of at least some sort.

**Reasons for Government Regulation**

In the face of the many problems inherent in capitalist economic systems, the solution of choice is government regulation—that is, rules and policies imposed by the government on various aspects of commerce within a country. The underlying justification is that responsibility in the business world comes about only through legislating it. Here is a simple example. Some financial investments, such as stocks, are regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)**,** whereas other investments, such as collectible stamps, are not. A respected stamp dealer was recently called out for making exaggerated claims about his stamp investment plan. One financial analyst explained:

Reading the marketing material made me shiver. It highlights how careful investors have to be when buying unregulated products—like stamps and other collectables. If I tried to sell investments like this to my customers I’d be shut down by the regulator . . . . [The stamp dealer] uses every trick in the book to make people part with their money. There is no attempt to explain the risks involved, or detail potential downsides, like early exit charges.

In this quotation, the financial analyst indicates how important investment regulation is for the protection of consumers. Investment markets without such regulation create opportunities for investment businesses to act irresponsibly.

             There are three fundamental justifications for governmental regulation within capitalist economic systems. First, regulation aims to protect consumers, workers, minorities, the environment, and any other interest or group of people that could be exploited in a competitive marketplace. The example of stamp investments shows how great the temptation is for financial-investment businesses to misrepresent their products, and, thus, how great the need for rules of transparency and for enforcement of those rules. A second justification is to assure that business markets remain competitive, by guarding against monopolies and prohibiting anticompetitive practices such as price fixing.

             There is a third and more controversial justification of government regulation, which is to help redistribute the wealth of society. As the gap between the rich and poor grows, society risks becoming stratified into two classes. At least some efforts at governmental regulations attempt to address this. Minimum wage is a case in point, and the need for government involvement here is demonstrated every few years when Congress debates minimum-wage increases. In 1938, the year of its inception in the United States, the federal minimum wage was set at 25 cents per hour, and it has been increased around 30 times since then. The longest period without an increase was 10 years, between 1997 and 2007, and during that time the prices of consumer goods rose considerably through inflation. Each time the issue was before Congress—and 2007 was no exception—business groups lobbied against an increase for the simple reason that increasing wages harms the bottom line. Like the minimum-wage regulation, government regulations that require health-care insurance for workers, worker’s compensation, and Social Security all aim at preventing an impoverished underclass.

**Mechanisms for Government Regulation**

There are two approaches to government regulation, one direct and the other indirect. Direct governmental regulation occurs when specific regulatory policies are established by an actual branch or agency of the government, such as Congress or the SEC. The indirect variety involves government-mandated self-regulation: In lieu of direct government involvement, the government mandates that a private self-regulatory organization set policies in a given market and the government then defers to that organization. For example, within the financial market, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority is the private self-regulatory organization that operates in con- cert with the SEC to assure that the securities industry operates fairly and honestly. Although it is not itself a government agency, it nevertheless operates under the oversight of the SEC.

             Another example vividly illustrates the relation between the government and self-regulatory organizations. In the 1980s, the U.S. Senate held committee hearings about the need for warning labels on music albums that would help alert parents to songs with violent or sexually explicit lyrics. While the Senate committee itself did not want to be accused of censoring artists or creating federal guidelines for the warning labels, they pressured the Recording Industry Association of America to create a labeling system. One senator made the direct threat that “unless the [record] industry ‘cleans up their act’ . . . there is likely to be legislation” (_Record Labeling_, 1985). The outcome of this hearing was the parental advisory label for music CDs that bears the words “Parental advisory—explicit content.” Music lyrics and financial investments are just two examples where self-regulatory organizations fill some important gap in the absence of direct government regulation. Many business professions have some type of self-regulatory organization, with notable ones being the American Medical Association, the American Dental Association, and the National Association of Realtors.

**Antitrust Acts**

Two laws are particularly important for setting the parameters of the free market in the United States. One is the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, the first federal law to outlaw price fixing and restrict monopolies. In the language of the statute, “Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony” (Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, Section 2). The aim of the law is to punish not businesses who become monopolies through fair competition, but only those who do so through anticompetitive misconduct. Monopolies themselves are not illegal, but the abuse of a dominant position is.

             The second law is the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, which restricts specific types of business practices that might potentially lead to anticompetitiveness, such as mergers and acquisitions that aim to create monopolistic power. Both of these laws laid the groundwork for antitrust policies in the United States that continue to the present day.

**The Federal Trade Commission (FTC)**

The government agency that is directly responsible for combating anticompetitive business practices is the **Federal Trade Commission (FTC),** founded in 1914. The initial purpose of the FTC was to prevent unfair methods of competition in commerce that led to monopolies and oligopolies—which at the time were called _trusts_. Since that time, Congress has given the agency greater authority to police anticompetitive practices. To this end, the FTC performs three central tasks:

• reviewing mergers and acquisitions, and challenging those that would likely lead to higher prices, fewer choices, or less innovation;

• seeking out and challenging anticompetitive conduct in the marketplace, including monopolization and agreements between competitors; and

• promoting competition in industries where consumer impact is high, such as health care, real estate, oil and gas, technology, and consumer goods (“Federal Trade Commission,” n.d.).

Regarding the first point, the FTC does not scrutinize all mergers, but only those that risk undermining market competition. The FTC has the authority to bring civil cases against offending businesses, and when the situation is bad enough, they work with the Department of Justice to bring criminal charges against offending businesses.

**GOVERNMENT INTRUSIONS INTO CAPITALISM**

Anti-competitive practices such as monopolies and price fixing are threats to capitalism that businesses themselves create, and governmental regulation is an important tool for preventing these problems from getting out of hand. However, governments themselves pose their own intrusions into to capitalism. Socialism, in its extreme forms, aims specifically at eliminating market competition and instead centralizing the country’s economy. But even capitalist-friendly governments such as the U.S. can go beyond mere regulation by setting policies that strike at the heart of the capitalist economic system. We will look at two of these: government bailouts and crony capitalism, and lobbying.

**Government Bailouts**

In 2008, the U.S. experienced a financial crisis that triggered a several-year recession which, according to many economists, was the worst since the great depression. The immediate cause was the burst of the real estate housing bubble: home prices were artificially inflated through reckless accounting practices, then prices quickly declined as owners defaulted on their mortgages. When banks and other mortgage holders could not sustain the losses, they verged on collapse, which caused a negative ripple effect across the whole economy. In an effort to save the economy from complete ruin, the U.S. government came to the assistance of nearly 1,000 companies in what is commonly called a **bailout**, that is, a government practice of giving financial support to a company that has serious financial problems. In this case the financial support totaled $659.1 billion. The breakdown of the bailout money received by these companies is this:

• 40%: Banks and financial institutions

• 30.6%: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac

• 13%: Auto companies

• 11.1%: AIG

• 3%: Toxic asset purchase

• 2.3%: Other

The majority of the payouts were investment loans that the receiving companies needed to give back, while the minority were subsidies that they could keep. Since 2008, the government has actually received a net profit of $46.3B from the bailout through money returned, dividends, interest and other proceeds.

             Thus, with this particular bailout, the issue is not so much one of taxpayers giving free money to irresponsible businesses. Rather, it is a question of whether the government had any right to rescue companies that failed because of their own ineptitude or negligence. Competition is at the core of capitalism, and these are companies that competed improperly, created fatal consequences for themselves, and deserved to be replaced by other companies that did not make those kind of mistakes.

             By bailing out these companies, did the government abandon its commitment to capitalism? Here are two possible answers. First, we might concede that the government temporarily set aside its commitment to capitalism and adopted a more socialistic solution. The entire economy was at risk, it needed saving, and, like during the Great Depression, flirting a little with socialism was a necessity for recovery. If the diehard capitalists are unhappy with that flirtation, they only have themselves to blame for not proactively addressing the problem in a capitalist-friendly way. It would of course be political suicide for the U.S. government to publicly say this or anything else that is linked with the world “socialism”.

             A second explanation for the government’s role is that it used a capitalist-like solution to cure the problem. It did not nationalize those failing companies and in most cases did not give them free money; that is, it did nothing remotely socialistic. Rather, it temporarily played the role of a capitalist investment company, and did so of necessity since more loan money was needed than private investment companies could afford to finance. In good capitalist fashion, it made the loans with the same oversight requirements that banks would impose, and made a profit on their investment. And, when all the loans are all paid in full, the government’s financial role in the crisis will be over. This explanation is at least as plausible as the first, and much less politically alienating. But the fact remains that, by seriously intervening in the survival of these companies, the government redefined its “hands off” commitment to capitalism.

**Crony Capitalism**

Do you like auto racing? If so, there is good news: Congress likes it too and recently gave $78 million in tax write-offs to NASCAR. According to one racetrack executive, “This allows us to compete with football, baseball and basketball, whose facilities are often financed with state and local tax money.” This legislation gave a total of $67.9 billion dollars in tax breaks to variety of industries including rum manufactures, asparagus growers and Hollywood producers.

             In all fairness, many of these breaks have reasonable justifications, such as tax credit for construction of renewable energy projects such as wind turbines. The larger problem here, though, is that of crony capitalism, sometimes called corporate welfare, where businesses receive special economic benefits from the government such as tax breaks, grants, economic development subsidies, or contracts. On face value, crony capitalism is contrary to genuine capitalism where businesses earn income by competing with each other in the market place; special gifts from the government gives some companies or entire business sectors an unfair advantage. Added to this there is the problem that the companies that receive the benefits are often the most politically well-connected and have a stronger lobby than their rivals. The government thus plays favorites, which is inherently unfair. Yet another concern is that the bulk of the subsidies are going to the largest corporations. A study by Subsidy Tracker titles “Subsidizing the Corporate One Percent” shows that over the past 40 years 75 percent of subsidy dollars have gone to only 965 large corporations, the highest paid recipients being Boeing, Alcoa, Intel, General Motors, and Ford Motors.

             Again, some special government subsidies may have perfectly reasonable justifications. It may be cheaper for the government to issue a subsidy to a business than deal with the financial costs of unemployment if the business goes under. Some subsidies may also help businesses deal with expensive government regulations. For example, government-created environmental regulations are sometimes financially crippling for specific industries, and government subsidies can be an efficient way of compensating businesses for that financial burden.

**IS EMINENT DOMAIN ANTI-CAPITALIST?**

**Governments Acquiring Property through Eminent Domain**

Charles Birnbaum owns a three-story brick building one block from the Ocean in Atlantic City, which has been in his family for 45 years. New Jersey’s Casino Reinvestment Development Authority wants the property condemned and claimed through eminent domain. The plan is for a mixed-use development project to reinvigorate tourism and the slumping Casino industry, but there are currently no precise designs for how Birnbaum’s property will be used in that development. Birnbaum commented that “If somebody said, ‘Charles, there is going to be a park here. We’re having a road that’s coming through. I would have accepted it and said, ‘So be it. Let’s make Atlantic City better.’ What they have given me is something so unsatisfying it doesn’t do it for me,”

             Eminent domain is a legal mechanism by which governments can take possession of private property for public use. Typically this is done for the building of highways, schools, public parks, railroads or utilities. Governments may either retain the acquired land themselves or may assign it to a private company, but in either case the acquisition of the land must be for public use as stipulated by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution: “nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.” In Birnbaum’s case, his property would be used for economic development, and most likely assigned by the state to a private developer.

             There is nothing inherently anti-capitalistic about eminent domain. It simply involves a conflict between two competing interests—private ownership vs. public interest—and these are situations where public interest wins out. Private property is an important value in society, but it is not the only value, and it is unreasonable for capitalists to expect that property interests will trump every other social value in all situations. In fact, companies themselves use eminent domain as a means of forcibly acquiring land from other private owners. For example, the energy company TransCanada relied on eminent domain agreements with several U.S. States to acquire land for constructing the Keystone oil pipeline from Canada to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.

             The anti-capitalist controversy surrounding eminent domain focuses on situations in which (1) land is acquired for purposes of economic development, (2) it is assigned to a private company, and (3) the public use of the acquired land is debatable. The anti-capitalist situation is worsened if the city hopes to benefit from the economic development through increased taxes. In essence, the city is forcing people off their private land so that private developers can build new and more expensive structures, which will in turn bring in more tax revenue for the city. This set of circumstances is sometimes called Kelo-style eminent domain abuse, named after the landmark Supreme Court case _Kelo v. New London_ (2005).

**Kelo v. New London**

In this court case, the city of New London, Connecticut used eminent domain to condemn and level several blocks of houses for a comprehensive redevelopment plan that included a water front conference hotel, a U.S. Coast Guard Museum, a pedestrian riverwalk, restaurants, retail stores and 80 new residences. The hub of the rejuvenation was a proposed $300 million research facility, which the planners hoped would draw new business to the area, and also create more tax revenue for the city. Susette Kelo and eight other home owners opposed the acquisition of their property on the grounds that the economic development plan did not constitute “public use”. The case went to the Supreme Court, which ultimately ruled against the home owners and held that the economic redevelopment plan did qualify as public use. The Court reasoned that the concept of “public use” has a history of being interpreted more broadly as “public purpose”, and New London’s economic development plan “unquestionably serves a public purpose.”

             The Supreme Court’s decision immediately sparked controversy. Forty-four states subsequently changed their laws to either prohibit or at least narrow the situations in which eminent domain can be used for economic development. As for the City of New London, the developer eventually abandoned the project after failed efforts to gain financing, Pfizer closed its New London facility, and the development area is now an empty lot.

**Public Pressure Makes Government Back Down**

With Charles Birnbaum and his house in Atlantic City, he took his case to court but lost. The judge stated that the New Jersey government provided “more than adequate assurances that the property will be used for the public purpose of promoting tourism and assisting the ailing gaming industry.” But eminent domain is so unpopular that cases of it result in public outcry, and the more Kelo-style it is, the more media attention it receives. Sometimes opposition is so great that the government in question backs down, even if courts rule in their favor. That is what happened with artist James Dupree when the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania attempted to acquire his art studio through eminent domain. It was in a high-poverty area with no nearby grocery stores, and the city sought to have one built on the site of Dupree’s studio. Support for Dupree grew among several organizations, including the Institute for Justice and the American Civil Liberties Union, and the city eventually gave up.

**CONCLUSION**

Winston Churchill famously said, “Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others.” This may apply equally to capitalism: Capitalism is the worst economic system, except for all the others. Undoubtedly, capitalism has advanced society in remarkable ways, and the long history of capitalism in the United States has made for the world’s strongest national economy. But these successes do not mean that capitalism is without serious problems. We have seen that an unregulated marketplace will lead to anticompetitive practices that can destroy all that is good about capitalism. With the profit motive as strong as it is, it is unrealistic to think that businesses will regulate themselves out of a sense of duty to society at large. For lack of any better regulatory mechanism, the government must assume that responsibility.

             This often places businesses and the government in an adversarial relationship, where businesses lobby against virtually every proposed regulation and, what is more, for the repeal of important regulations that are already in place. If businesses achieved everything they wanted with their antiregulatory lobbying efforts, unfair and anticompetitive business practices could reach epidemic proportions. Although the regulatory relationship between business and government is imperfect, it is an important safeguard for capitalism’s health. In our opening example, we saw that Bolivia’s experiment with privatizing water led to massive protests. Marx warned that it could get much worse: Workers might launch a full-scale revolution in reaction to being systematically exploited by capitalist business owners. This worst-case scenario has played out in dozens of countries within the last century, and the stakes are too high to risk that happening in the United States and other welfare capitalist countries. This may well be a situation in which doing the ethical thing in business requires the acceptance of government involvement.

**INTRODUCTION**

Racial prejudice has been the source of social conflict and personal suffering for as long as there have been human records, and quite possibly for tens of thousands of years before that. Rival ethnic groups wage war upon each other, enslave members of opposing groups, and even try to exterminate them. The concept of racial equality is a comparatively recent one, and it has only been a matter of decades that governments have denounced racial prejudice and made efforts to undo at least some of the damage it has caused.

             India is a case in point, with its centuries-old tradition of the _caste system_, which has splintered the population into a hierarchy of social classes. While the higher castes have been the holders of the country’s wealth and power, at the very bottom are the “untouchables” who are so low that, in the past, upper castes avoided coming into any contact with them. Making up 16% of the country’s population, they historically had no meaningful access to education, respectable employment, or political representation. Millions today live on the streets or in garbage dumps, where they forage for scraps of anything that might have some resale value. While India was a colony, the British government made efforts to elevate the untouchables into mainstream society, one of the first efforts at what we now call affirmative action. After independence in 1947, the government of India continued this policy, even writing into the constitution special protections and opportunities for the untouchables. Among these policies is the reservation of 16% of all government jobs for untouchables, in direct proportion to their number in the population. A high percentage of student positions in universities are also reserved for them.

             When we look at India’s situation, it is easy to conclude that the country chose the right remedy: Dramatic injustices call for dramatic corrective measures, without which the untouchables would be forever locked into a cycle of the most unimaginable poverty. It is not just India, however, that has this problem. Many of the world’s countries have minority groups that are economically suffering because of a history of discrimination. The United States is a case in point. This country has adopted solutions like India’s, though not quite as radical. Businesses in particular are on the cutting edge of social reforms that aim to elevate historically disadvantaged minority groups. Sometimes companies proactively embrace these efforts, but in most cases the efforts are backed by government mandates and businesses have no choice but to comply. Discrimination in the workplace is one of the most important ethical and legal issues for businesses. Social conscience urges companies to eliminate discriminatory practices, and the law requires them to do so. In this chapter, we will explore many of the issues connected with discrimination in the workplace.

**DISCRIMINATION**

We will begin with a look at the nature of discrimination itself, how it affects businesses and other social institutions, and the evidence for it.

**Features of Discrimination**

Two types of discrimination are relevant to businesses:

• _Public accommodations discrimination_: a business or some other public access place prejudicially denies services to some customers.

• _Employment discrimination_: the prejudicial treatment of people in hiring, promotion, and termination decisions.

Take this simple case of public accommodations discrimination: A white man and a black man who are dressed similarly enter a restaurant; the white man is served and the black man is asked to leave. In essence, the black man was asked to leave purely because of his race. Here is a simple case of employment discrimination: A man and a woman both apply for the same job; the woman’s qualifications are much stronger, but the employer hires the man instead. Here, the woman was turned down purely because of her gender, and not because of her abilities. _Discrimination_ is the unjust or prejudicial treatment of people on arbitrary grounds, such as race, gender, or age, which results in denial of opportunity, such as in public accommodations or employment.

             Key to this definition is the idea that _the treatment is based on arbitrary grounds_. With public accommodations discrimination, a person’s gender or skin color is irrelevant to his or her function as a customer, and it would be arbitrary to deny that person service. With employment discrimination, it is also irrelevant to the person’s job performance, and it would also be arbitrary to deny that person an employment opportunity on that basis. Sometimes, though, it is not discriminatory to deny opportunities to people because of some unique feature about them. Suppose that a blind person tried to rent a car from Hertz or apply for a job as an air-traffic controller. In these cases, having eyesight is a necessary requirement for driving a car or being an air-traffic controller, and there is nothing arbitrary about denying those opportunities to blind people.

             However, it can be a challenge sometimes to determine whether a particular physical feature is needed to do the job. An interesting case illustrating this is that of a 240-pound woman from San Francisco who was denied work as an aerobics instructor because of her weight. The company in question was Jazzercise, which advertised itself as the world’s leading dance-fitness program, having 5,000 certified instructors across the country. The company’s stated policy was that their instructors must have a “fit appearance,” and they turned down the woman when seeing her in person. After she complained to the San Francisco Human Rights Commission, the Jazzercise company agreed to drop the “fit appearance” criterion and conceded that “recent studies document that it may be possible for people of varying weights to be fit” (quoted in Ackman, 2002). This case shows that long-standing stereotypes may be grounded in little more than prejudice, and this is precisely what makes discriminatory treatment unfair.

             The most commonly acknowledged forms of discrimination today are on the bases of race, gender, disability, and age. Still others include color, creed, political affiliation, national origin, religion, ancestry, pregnancy, medical condition, mental condition, marital status, sexual orientation, and status as a veteran. The list of discrimination types could be endless: I could discriminate against people who were fans of a rival sports team, or liked a particular type of music, or drove a particular model of car. Whatever differences exist between one human and another could potentially become matters of prejudice and arbitrary treatment.

**Social Institutions and Discrimination**

In combating discrimination, there are three principal social institutions that are targeted for change: schools, businesses, and governments.

             Eliminating discrimination in schools is important because these institutions provide people with the skills to compete for almost everything else in life. If schools at both the K–12 and college levels systematically discriminated against certain groups, those individuals would forever be at a competitive disadvantage and locked into something like a caste system which it would be exceedingly difficult to rise above.

             Eliminating discrimination in positions of political power is important because it is the government that shapes social policy regarding the equal treatment of groups. Without proper representation in government, the risk is too great that the interests of White males will prevail over those of other groups.

             Finally, eliminating discrimination in the workplace is important because it is the quality of jobs that determines whether an employee becomes rich or poor. When employers systematically discriminate against certain groups, they thereby turn those groups into a socioeconomic underclass from which, again, it is difficult to break free.

**Intentional and Unintentional Discrimination**

In the past, discrimination was an integral and acceptable part of doing business; that was a reflection of the prevailing social order. Women and ethnic minorities, it was felt, should be treated differently as customers and belong only in specific jobs, typically lower paying ones, and it was just assumed that the better jobs should go to White males. Not so now. The law protects women and minority groups from discrimination, and it is a serious blemish on a business’s moral record to be accused of discriminatory practices. Still, some discrimination continues today in spite of changing laws and social attitudes.

             Sometimes businesses engage in _intentional discrimination_, when the policies of a company are shaped by overt racial prejudices of its managers or executives. For example, a family restaurant in a racially divided town had a policy of placing a small letter B on the back of application forms filled out by black applicants. They would then overlook these applications when selecting candidates to interview. The business managers were knowingly and intentionally discriminating against black applicants. Other times, however, businesses engage in _unintentional discrimination_ when their policies uncritically reflect prejudicial stereotypes. A famous public accommodations example of this was when President Bill Clinton 21 secret service agents went to a Denny’s restaurant for breakfast; while the white agents received their meals, those for six black agents arrived only after repeated requests an hour later just as the group was leaving. A spokesperson for Denny’s stated that "It's a service issue, not a discriminatory issue," which he said resulted from the quantity of orders and the kitchen backlog. 

             While the spokesperson’s explanation is plausible, the incident sparked a $54 million class action law suit against Denny’s that revealed a pattern discriminatory activity in many of the restaurant’s locations. The Jazzercise example from before appears to be a case of unintentional employment discrimination in that the company wrongly assumed that only people within a certain weight range were athletically fit.

             It is not just weight, but policies about height, beards, tattoos, and body piercings can also have a discriminatory effect. Unintentional discrimination of this sort is sometimes referred to as a “facially neutral employment practice,” which is defined by anti-discrimination law as a practice “that does not appear to be discriminatory on its face; rather it is one that is discriminatory in its application or effect.” For example, companies can establish dress codes, but they cannot have a discriminatory impact either on its face or as an effect. Source: Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

             Some of our personal biases are often hidden from us, and, to help reveal them, a research project called Project Implicit has several free online tests that users can take to uncover their implicit associations about race, gender, weight, sexuality, religion, disability, and age. According to Project Implicit, “Much of perception, thinking, and action occurs outside of conscious awareness or conscious control. Because of that, judgment and action can be unintentionally influenced by factors that we do not recognize, and may not value.” By becoming aware of these unconscious factors, businesses might better achieve “organizational innovation and change.”

**Evidence of Public Accommodations Discrimination**

When looking for evidence of discrimination within the business world, there are two types: direct and indirect. _Direct evidence of discrimination_ is overt written or oral statements by employers that display their discriminatory intention. A sign on a restaurant door that says “No Blacks” would be an example of this with public accommodation discrimination. Finding direct evidence, though, is difficult, since employers rarely make explicit discriminatory statements such as “our policy is to not serve black people” either in writing or verbally. It is more likely that there will be _indirect evidence of discrimination_, where the behavior of the company implies discriminatory conduct. An example would be the Denny’s case of serving white agents before black ones.

             Before the Civil Rights Act of 1964, direct and indirect evidence abounded: just do an internet image search for “whites only” and “no colored” and you will get numerous old photographs of discriminatory signs on restaurants, hotels, restrooms, water fountains, benches, laundromats, swimming pools, beaches. But what about now: hasn’t public accommodations discrimination been eliminated? Unfortunately, it is alive and well in business. Attorneys specialize in it throughout the country, State governments have offices devoted to it, and complaints are plentiful.

             Immediately after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, many businesses overtly discriminated against middle-eastern customers. On the afternoon of the attacks, a Hotel in Des Moines, Iowa, revoked its previous offer to host the annual convention of the Midwest Federation of American Syrian-Lebanese Clubs, and repeatedly refused to reconsider its decision in the subsequent weeks. In another case, the manager of a night club told a Sikh customer to remove his turban or leave the club, while that same Sikh customer had been permitted to wear it at the club prior to September 11. A survey of around 1,000 Arabs and Muslims by the New York City Commission on Human Rights indicated that 69% of the respondents experienced discrimination after the attacks, one-quarter of which was related to public accommodations.

             But even in less politically-charged climates, clear cases of public accommodations regularly occur. In 2008 a case was settled against a nightclub in Virginia Beach, Virginia, that imposed a dress code that targeted hair styles common among African-Americans, such as dreadlocks, cornrows and braids, and did so as a pretext for denying African-Americans admission. A government spokesperson commented that “It is unfortunate that in today’s society, African-Americans and other individuals still must endure discrimination and segregation in public gathering places such as restaurants and nightclubs.”

             In 2010, a day camp contracted with a swim club in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania to have weekly 90 minute use of the club's pool for the camp's students. On the first day, 56 campers, predominately black, used the pool; some club members complained on the basis of race. The next day the club enacted a policy barring all summer camps from using the pool, which prevented this day camp from returning. A law suit was filed against the swim club.

             In 2014 a case was settled against a restaurant owner in Boston, Massachusetts which on several occasions refused to admit African-American, Hispanic, and Cape Verdean patrons. One staff member allegedly told these patrons that they could not enter the bar because they did not “know the owner” and that the bar did not want any “trouble” or “problems.” The owner agreed to a $100,000 settlement.

             When complaints of accommodations discrimination are brought to the Department of Justice, the agency sometimes uses “testers” to confirm the allegations, which they explain here:

Fair housing testing consists of individuals posing as prospective home seekers (i.e., testers) simulating housing transactions with a housing provider. Responses from the housing provider to the testers are compared for differences. An inference of discrimination can be made when there is a substantial difference in the treatment of the testers by the housing provider when the only material difference between the testers is a protected basis (e.g., disability). A “Protected Tester” is one who exhibits the protected characteristic being tested. A “Control Tester” lacks the protected characteristic.

In 2013 the Department of Justice settled a case in which a property manager in Edina, Minnesotta discriminated against a prospective renter from Somolia. The testing evidence indicated that the manager “showed white testers apartments when they walked in while she told Somali testers they had to make an appointment to see an apartment the next day.  She also failed to tell Somali testers about certain apartments becoming available that she mentioned to white testers.”

             Similarly, in 2014 the Department of Justice settled a case against an apartment complex landlord in North Ridgeville, Ohio, who routinely quoted higher rental and application fee rates to African Americans and refused to show them vacant units. “The department sent African-American and white testers posing as prospective renters to the complex and the African-American testers were quoted higher rents and application fees than the white testers. African-American testers were also told that they could not view a unit at that time, while similarly situated white testers were shown units.” The landlord agreed to pay $30,000 to resolve the complaint. A Department of Justice spokesperson said that “It is simply unacceptable for a landlord to make renting an apartment more difficult and more expensive because of a person’s race.”

**Evidence of Employment Discrimination**

The employment process within business is often a private one where discussions and decisions about prospective candidates are not open to public view. As a result, direct evidence of employment discrimination is hard to come by, and evidence has to be gathered by more indirect means. One strategy for presenting indirect evidence of employment discrimination in court is called the burden-shifting formula, where the burden rests on the employer to show that its behavior was not discriminatory (_McDonnell Douglas Corp v. Green_, 1973). The formula has three steps:

1. The employee makes an initial case that she was treated differently, such as that she was overlooked for promotion because she was female.

2. The employer gives a nondiscriminatory explanation for its conduct, such as that the woman lacked seniority and thus was not qualified for promotion.

3. The employee refutes this explanation as a mere pretext for discrimination, such as by showing that less experienced males in the company had gotten promotions.

The evidence here is still indirect, since there is no explicit statement from the company to the effect of “we did not promote you because you are a woman.” However, through the undermining of the company’s nondiscriminatory explanation, it seems more reasonable that the company’s differential treatment was discriminatory in nature.

             There is another type of indirect evidence that suggests the discriminatory treating of minorities within society as a whole, namely income inequality, which involves an analysis of the extent to which income is distributed in an uneven manner among a population. Some income-inequality studies focus specifically on race and gender disparities, and much of those data in the United States come from the Census Bureau. The statistics show that race and gender income differences have decreased since 1953, but a sizeable income gap still remains between minority workers and White males. The statistics themselves show only that major income disparities exist between White males and minority workers. But to use this as evidence for discrimination, a person must further show that these differences cannot be reasonably explained by nondiscriminatory factors.

White, not Hispanic Male: $56,456

White, not Hispanic Female: $42,784

Asian male: 60,191

Asian female: 45,335

Black male: 41,555

Black female: 35,460

Hispanic male: 32,949

Hispanic female: 30,799

With gender, there are a few possible nondiscriminatory reasons. It is often suggested that women gravitate towards careers that pay lower than those of men, such as education, counseling, and nursing. It is also argued that many women place less value on jobs with long work hours and more value on a flexible schedule that allows for family commitments. In the words of one analyst, “women are less willing to work long hours and relocate, and more eager for part-time work arrangements” (Women in Management, 2002). These explanations are controversial, and perhaps even grounded in stereotypes. However, they suggest that women’s choices may be a source of gender income disparities and, if so, the income-inequality argument for discrimination falls apart.

             With racial income inequality, there is also a possible nondiscriminatory explanation: Black and Hispanic people have less access to education, which in turn makes them less competitive for lucrative jobs. Thus, their lower pay may be not the result of employment discrimination, but instead an unfortunate consequence of their sociological background. The educational obstacle is less of a barrier for White women, who first surpassed White men in college enrollment in 1991; since then, the gap has continued to widen  as the following chart shows:

Share of recent high school completers enrolled in college the following October

             Women            Men

1994:   63%                 61%

2012:   71%                 61%

Pay gaps that begin at the initial acquisition of jobs often continue with promotions within the company. This sometimes is associated with a phenomenon called the _glass ceiling_, where women and minority workers hit a level beyond which they cannot advance, while their White male counterparts continue to progress. In the words of one governmental investigation, it is “the unseen, yet unbreachable barrier that keeps minorities and women from rising to the upper rungs of the corporate ladder, regardless of their qualifications or achievements” (Federal Glass Ceiling Commission, 1995).

             The image of a glass ceiling is a telling one: It suggests that as women and minorities compete with others to climb the ladder of success, they bump into a barrier that keeps them from rising higher, while they can see their White male counterparts continue to rise above them. For example, Outback Steakhouse settled a $19 million class-action lawsuit by female employees who maintained that they “hit a glass ceiling and could not get promoted to the higher-level profit-sharing management positions in the restaurants” (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 2009). One analysis of the glass ceiling looked at the percentage of women vs. men in the top 1% of earnings. While it’s getting better for women, the gap is still there. According to the author, gathering data on this in the U.S. is difficult since tax records of married couples reflect joint income, not each spouse’s individual income. However, some parallel might be drawn from countries that do record individual income of couples. In Canada, for example, “the proportion of women in the top 1% . . . risen from 11% in 1982 to 21% in 2010.”

             But this concept of the glass ceiling is also controversial, and with gender-based glass ceilings the argument has been put forward that many obstacles to women’s promotion result from personal choices, such as the desire for part-time working arrangements. As one analyst stated, “the only ceiling that exists in corporate America is gender-neutral—it prevents those who choose to devote more time to their personal lives from advancing at the same rate as those who devote more uninterrupted time to the workplace” (_Women in Management_, 2002).

             In short, income-inequality statistics and the phenomenon of the glass ceiling demonstrate that serious pay gaps exist. However, that in and of itself does not constitute compelling indirect evidence of systematic employment discrimination. It still may be important to attempt to eliminate the pay gap even if it cannot be demonstrated to result from current discriminatory employment practices. The pay gap that exists still has historical roots in past discrimination, and that alone may justify remedying the inequality.

**EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION AND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION**

There is no doubt that employment discrimination has taken place in the past and continues today to at least some extent. The question, then, becomes one of finding the best means of combating it. The gentlest public policy for uprooting discrimination in organizations is _equal opportunity_, which is simply the policy of treating employees without discrimination. It involves neutral, nondiscriminatory hiring practices. The hope is that, through the simple removal of discriminatory barriers, historically disadvantaged groups may finally be able to compete head-to-head with White males and thereby eventually remove all racial and gender economic disparities. By today’s standards, there is nothing controversial about this neutral, nondiscriminatory notion of equal opportunity, and perhaps only a committed bigot would oppose it.

             A much more aggressive mechanism for combating discrimination is _affirmative action_, which is a policy of improving the opportunities of those within historically disadvantaged groups through positive measures beyond neutral, nondiscriminatory action. We will next look at key features of affirmative action policies and at arguments for and against them.

**Features of Affirmative Action**

The principal aim of affirmative action policies in the workplace is to increase the representation of women and minority groups in areas of business from which they have been historically excluded. Some of these positive measures include

• active recruiting of minority workers,

• elimination of biases in job criteria,

• minority training programs for senior positions, and

• active promotion of minority workers to senior positions.

The aim of affirmative action is sometimes described as _equal results_, meaning achieving proportional minority representation in a work or economic environment where minorities are presently underrepresented. For example, if 2% of the White male population is wealthy, then 2% of the population of women and minorities should be wealthy. In this sense, affirmative action seeks to achieve an outcome in which women and minorities are proportionally represented in positions of wealth and power. One government agency provides testimonials of employees who have benefited from affirmative action programs; here are two:

• Bernadette, of Washington, D.C., works as a carpenter because of a federal affirmative action program. She is an African-American single parent with two children, who says “because the company had an affirmative action program, I got on the job site.”

• Janice became an astronaut with NASA at the Johnson Space Center in July 1991, because of NASA’s affirmative action program. She has since logged over 438 hours in space. She describes the NASA equal employment opportunity policy: “Under NASA’s developing equal opportunity and diversity policies, all hiring and advancement decisions are based on individual qualifications and merit, but recruitment and development programs are structured such that high-quality candidates are available to help achieve a representative workforce.” (Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, 2002, Section D.iii)

The point in both of these testimonials is that affirmative action programs through their employers gave these women work opportunities that they would not likely have received otherwise. Affirmative action policies are typically seen as temporary measures to fix problems that exist right now; when equality is achieved, they will no longer be necessary.

**Preferential Treatment**

The most controversial component of affirmative action is _preferential treatment_, that is, special consideration given in hiring and promotion situations to people from historically disadvantaged groups. Suppose, for example, that a White man and a Black man are applying for the same job, and, although their credentials are similar, the White man has more educational experience. Thus, on paper, the White man is the stronger candidate. Since the Black man is a member of a historically underrepresented group, preferential treatment policies would make him the preferred candidate over the White man. Sometimes preferential treatment involves a _quota system_, where a certain number of jobs are set aside for members of minority groups in direct proportion to their numbers in the community. The notions of affirmative action and preferential treatment are often used interchangeably, but they are not identical: Preferential treatment is just one type of affirmative action policy, and is not necessarily the central component. As one governmental agency stated, “Affirmative action is not preferential treatment. Nor does it mean that unqualified persons should be hired or promoted over other people. What affirmative action does mean is that positive steps must be taken to provide equal employment opportunity” (EEOC, 1993). Nevertheless, preferential treatment has become the focal point for debates about affirmative action policies.

**Compensation for Discrimination**

The strategy of affirmative action programs is group-oriented in the sense that every individual who belongs to a designated group will thereby qualify for some special consideration. To explain, there are two ways that we might compensate minority groups for their historical disadvantages. First, there might be _individual compensation_, where each person is compensated based on his or her individual claim. For example, a Black man might argue that he was discriminated against when he was overlooked for a promotion at his job. He could then sue his company and present his case in court; if he succeeded, his company would then compensate him individually. Scenarios like this in fact occur regularly.

             Second, there might be _group compensation_, where each individual within a disadvantaged group is compensated based purely on his or her membership in that group. This is the approach that the government takes with affirmative action policy. It identifies a group that has been historically disadvantaged and addresses the situation by compensating each person within that group. The benefit of group compensation is that it avoids the impossible task of examining the claims of each person individually within that group. For example, with group compensation, a Black woman would not have to show how she had been personally disadvantaged through the legacy of slavery, Jim Crow laws, and racial prejudice. Those facts have already been established for her minority group as a whole, so she would not have to make her case individually.

             There are downsides to group compensation, however, which is the source of some of the controversy with affirmative action policies:

• Some individual members of a minority group may be less deserving of compensation than other individual members but receive the benefit anyway. Take, for example, a Black man who was raised in an affluent family and never personally experienced any prejudice or discrimination. He would still be entitled to the same special consideration as a Black man who has personally experienced discrimination.

• Some members of majority groups may be as deserving of special consideration as members of a minority group are, yet will not qualify to receive it. Take, for example, a White man whose family has been caught up in a cycle of poverty for generations and who experiences the same socioeconomic disadvantages as a poor Black man. Since he is not a member of the Black minority group, he does not qualify for compensation.

From the government’s standpoint, however, the strengths of group compensation outweigh its weaknesses, so this is the approach that affirmative action policies take.

**Arguments for Affirmative Action**

Among the many arguments offered in defense of affirmative action policies, here are three common ones.

**_Helps Create Fairness_**

The first and most important one is that affirmative action is a matter of fairness since it lessens the competitive disadvantage of minorities, which results from past unjust social treatment. It creates a more equal playing field for employment and promotion, since White males still have many advantages. The rationale behind affirmative action was given in a famous speech by President Lyndon Johnson in 1965:

Equal opportunity is essential, but not enough, not enough. Men and women of all races are born with the same range of abilities. But ability is not just the product of birth. Ability is stretched or stunted by the family that you live with and the neighborhoods you live in—by the school you go to and the poverty or the richness of your surroundings. It is the product of a hundred unseen forces playing upon the little infant, the child, and finally the man. (paragraph 16)

Johnson’s point was that people’s abilities are often shaped by social factors beyond their control, particularly education and family environment. A member of a racial minority who is born into such a disadvantaged situation will not be able to effectively compete for higher level jobs; it is only through affirmative steps that society can help elevate him or her to those positions. President Bill Clinton similarly stated that “the purpose of affirmative action is to give our nation a way to finally address the systemic exclusion of individuals of talent on the basis of their gender or race from opportunities to develop, perform, achieve and contribute” (1995, p. 1108). His point was that social practices of systematic exclusion have had a long-term negative impact on minority groups that cannot immediately be erased by merely ending discriminatory behavior.

**_Helps Reduce Poverty_**

A second argument for affirmative action is that it helps reduce poverty. Completely apart from issues of fairness, affirmative action has an important social benefit, since high poverty rates adversely affect society as a whole and not just the poor themselves. Poverty contributes to crime, reduces the educational level of the workforce, and strains the country’s welfare system. Minority discrimination and poverty are correlated, and thus by providing job opportunities to members of those minority groups, poverty within those groups is lessened. This not only reduces poverty for the recipients of affirmative action, but it helps break the cycle of poverty that these recipients would otherwise pass on to their children.

**_Helps Reduce Racism_**

A third argument is that affirmative action helps reduce racism. Much of the bigotry expressed towards minorities owes to low socioeconomic status, a culture of poverty, and harmful stereotypes that inevitably result from this. Through getting better jobs, the socioeconomic status of members of minority groups is improved and the traditional stereotypes do not apply. These workers thus become positive role models that others within that minority group may be inspired to follow. They also become positive models that others in society can look towards when upgrading their own attitudes about minorities.

**Arguments Against Affirmative Action**

There are three main arguments against affirmative action, each of which focuses on the controversial component of preferential treatment.

**_Creates Reverse Discrimination_**

The first of these is that preferential treatment is unfair and amounts to reverse discrimination, where a more qualified candidate from the majority group is unfairly denied an opportunity in preference to a less qualified candidate from a minority group. On this view, affirmative action policies work so hard to protect minority groups that they often penalize a member of the majority group, usually a White male. Then California Governor Pete Wilson expressed this sentiment here:

Today the fundamental American principle of equality is being eroded, eroded by a system of preferential treatment that awards public jobs, public contracts, and seats in our public universities, not based on merit and achievement but on membership in a group defined by race, ethnicity, or gender. That’s not right. It’s not fair. It is, by definition, discrimination. (1996, p. 167)

In this quotation, Wilson argued that all discrimination on the basis of race and sex is inherently unfair and unequal—and that also applies to preferential treatment. The rights that White males have to not be discriminated against are as valid as those of any member of a minority group.

             The point is that even if we concede that preferential-treatment programs aim to help historically disadvantaged groups, such good intentions alone do not make the policies just. Imagine that, in our efforts to redress the past harms from discrimination, we redistributed half of the wealth of all White males among minorities. One day I have $10,000 in my bank account and the next day I have $5,000, with the missing half going into the bank accounts of members of disadvantaged minorities. Even if this had a proven benefit to the members of the minority groups, most of us would judge an effort like this to be grossly unfair to White males. While preferential treatment is not as extreme as this, it has the same kind of built-in unfairness. Another way that this unfairness is expressed is that preferential treatment essentially takes the view that two wrongs make a right. Some Whites in the past discriminated against some minority groups, even enslaving their members, and that was undoubtedly wrong. In the present, descendants of those members of minority groups, through preferential-treatment programs, have been given opportunities over better qualified Whites who had nothing to do with that past discrimination. But these two wrongs do not make preferential treatment right.

**_Creates Social Tension and Negative Attitudes About Minorities_**

A second argument against preferential treatment is that it creates social tension and negative attitudes about minorities who benefit from these programs. If an employer has one job opening and hires a minority applicant to fill it, there may be 50 angry White male applicants, each of whom blames that minority applicant for taking the job away from him. The Wilson quote earlier shows the kind of outrage that preferential-treatment programs can generate. Other critics have gone further and argued that preferential-treatment programs have created an atmosphere in which White males are openly vilified and can do little to stop it. As one opponent of these programs stated, “We have institutionalized a counter-white-male bias. We have created a new group who are being discriminated against. . . . [This group has] no access to legal recourse or power. We have institutionalized discrimination against one group. When does it end?” (Lynch, 1989, p. 181). Rather than creating equality and removing social tension, preferential treatment has resulted in a new inequality where there is a hierarchy of the oppressed. Blacks are the primary recipients of preferential treatment, followed by women, then Native Americans, then Hispanics, then Asians, then individuals with disabilities, and this continues until we finally reach White males at the bottom of the scale. Thus, according to critics, what started out as a policy to reduce social tensions has ended up creating new tensions.

             A vivid example of this a student named Adam Noska who won a $250 “whites-only” scholarship that was set up as a prank by members of the College Republicans at Roger Williams University. Paralleling racial minority scholarships, candidates for the scholarship had to write an essay—in this case a 100 word essay—on “why you are proud of your white heritage” and “what being white means to you.” Candidates also had to include a photo to “confirm whiteness.” The irony was that the student who devised the scholarship was Hispanic and the recipient of a minority scholarship himself. Liberal students at the University protested, the issue attracted national attention, the state Republican Party criticized it for having racist overtones, and the University’s president said that he had redouble his efforts to make the campus an open environment. Noska ultimately donated the money to a local charity and stated that “"What I was not prepared for was the overwhelming number of people who told me that I had disappointed them or that they expected more out of me.”

**_Exceeds Sufficient Nondiscrimination Without Preferential Treatment_**

A third argument is that nondiscrimination without preferential treatment is sufficient for achieving social equality. Society has come a long way since the days of overt racism and sexism, and the laws that we currently have in place are all that we need to elevate the economic status of women and minorities. Government officials continually promise that preferential treatment is only a temporary measure that in time will no longer be necessary, but that time seems to never come. Critics thus contend that programs of preferential treatment are no longer necessary, and now is the time for dismantling them.

**U.S. ANTI-DISCRIMINATION LAWS**

Each country has its own history of both discriminatory practices and laws to combat them; we have already examined the situation in India. In this section we will look at the United States’ anti-discrimination laws and the impact that they have on businesses. The legal issues surrounding these policies in the United States are not always the most enjoyable things to explore. There are subtle conceptual distinctions and complex regulations, and emotions run high. However, this is precisely where nondiscrimination in the workplace is put into practice.  From a practical standpoint, being ethical in non-discriminatory business practices ultimately means following government regulations. All employees in medium to large companies need to be familiar with key aspects of these laws; for many managers, mastery of non-discrimination policies will be a key part of their job.

**The Civil Rights Act of 1964**

The story of Federal anti-discrimination laws begins with the civil rights movement of the late 1950s and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This legislation was devised to put an end to a century of racial segregation and discrimination. It was hotly contested in Congress; one Southern senator stated, “We will resist to the bitter end any measure or any movement which would have a tendency to bring about social equality and intermingling and amalgamation of the races in our states” (quoted in Spartacus Educational, n.d.). Fortunately that senator was outvoted. The Act addresses issues of discrimination in voting, segregation in public facilities and schools. But two portions are especially relevant to businesses. Title II of the act prohibits discrimination and segregation in places of public accommodation, such as hotels, restaurants, gas stations theaters, and stadiums. The critical portion of it is this:

All persons shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, and privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation, as defined in this section, without discrimination or segregation on the ground of race, color, religion, or national origin. (Section 201)

Employment discrimination is addressed in Title VII, the critical portion of which is this:

It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer—

(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; or

(2) to limit, segregate, or classify his employees in any way which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. (Section 703)

Title VII allows for some exemptions where discrimination can be permitted, but these must involve _bona fide occupational qualifications_, that is, qualifications that relate to an essential job duty and are “reasonably necessary to the normal operation of that particular business or enterprise”. (Civil Rights Act [1964] Title VII, Section 703, 3e). An example of this would be disqualifying a blind applicant for an air-traffic controller job, as mentioned earlier. Similarly, a theater company could disqualify a male actor who applied for a female role in a play, or an Episcopal church could disqualify an ordained Baptist preacher for a ministerial position.

             In both Title II and Title VII we see reference to the concept of protected classes, which are the specific groups that are protected from discrimination by law. The groups mentioned above are those of individual’s race, color, religion, sex, and national origin.

**Affirmative Action: Two Laws, Two Agencies**

Affirmative action policies in the United States are founded on two distinct laws: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and Presidential Executive Order Number 11246 in 1965. The term _affirmative action_ made its way into law through an earlier executive order by President Kennedy in 1961 requiring any business seeking a federal government contract to engage in affirmative action. The order stated, “The contractor will not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, creed, color, or national origin. The contractor will take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin” (Executive Order No. 10925, 1961). But Kennedy’s conception of affirmative action was mild, and meant essentially that contractors needed to exhibit an active concern to eliminate discrimination. Four years later, this order was revised and strengthened by President Johnson and also included gender (Executive Order No. 11246, 1965).

             It was in 1968 that the government first required target dates for evaluating a contractor’s affirmative action program. The regulation stated, “The contractor’s program shall provide in detail for specific steps to guarantee equal employment opportunity keyed to the problems and needs of minority groups, including, when there are deficiencies, the development of specific goals and timetables for the prompt achievement of full and equal employment opportunity” (Affirmative Action Law and Legal Definition, n.d.). This is the basis of the more aggressive notion of affirmative action that includes preferential treatment. In theory, the executive orders for contractors do not require every company in the United States to adopt aggressive affirmative action policies. However, since government contracts are such an important source of revenue throughout the business world, the executive orders had the practical effect of mandating this uniformly, especially for medium to large corporations.

**_Enforcing Title VII and Executive Order No. 11246_**

The task of enforcing Title VII of the Civil Rights Act was assigned to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which sets policies for dealing with discrimination complaints, holds hearings on specific complaints, and has the authority to file discrimination suits against employers. The commission’s single mission is “the elimination of illegal discrimination from the workplace” (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, n.d.). While the EEOC oversees compliance with Title VII, the affirmative action Executive Order for government contractors is under the domain of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP)—a branch of the Department of Labor. The OFCCP enforces affirmative action compliance in several ways. It offers technical assistance to federal contractors and subcontractors to help them understand the regulatory requirements and review process. It conducts compliance evaluations and complaint investigations of federal contractors’ personnel policies and procedures. The ultimate punishment by the OFCCP for violations is the loss of a company’s federal contracts, and companies may have to pay lost wages to victims of discrimination. Each year, the OFCCP issues an “Opportunity Award” to a contractor who implements outstanding affirmative action programs; recipients have included Raytheon, Texas A&M University, and Dell.

             The laws and regulations that are jointly enforced by the EEOC and OFCCP are called equal employment opportunity (EEO) laws. From a business’s perspective, EEO laws mandated by the EEOC and OFCCP go hand in hand: While the one agency oversees Title VII, and the other government contracts, medium to large businesses typically need to comply with both. It is beyond the scope of this chapter to give a detailed account of the EEO laws, but there are a few important concepts relating to these laws that are central to compliance for businesses and to the debates surrounding them. One of them is the concept of a protected class, described above. Since the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the list of legally protected groups regarding employment discrimination has grown and now the full list includes (1) race, (2) color, (3) religion, (4) sex, and (5) national origin, (6) age—people over 40, (7) handicap, and (8) genetic information.. Technically speaking, every U.S. citizen belongs to some protected class, if only by virtue of being either a man or a woman and having genetic information. However, the EEO laws aim specifically at protecting women and minority groups because of the history of discrimination against them. A minority is a subgroup of a population that differs in race, religion, or national origin from the dominant group. The EEOC designates a minority as being one of four groups: (1) American Indians or Alaskan Natives, (2) Asians or Pacific Islanders, (3) Blacks, or (4) Hispanics. The EEOC does not technically classify women as a minority. However, women are considered as having “minority status” as far as the law is concerned, since they have experienced the same kind of systematic employment discrimination as the various minorities.

**Compliance Guidelines and Plans**

The government does not simply trust that employers will embrace nondiscrimination and affirmative action practices. Rather, employers must follow complex protocols, and compliance places high demands on their personnel resources. Several consulting companies specialize in affirmative action compliance; one advertises that it can help companies successfully navigate “through the complex maze of affirmative action regulations” (AAP Consultants LLC, n.d.).

             There are two main government protocols that most medium to large businesses must follow for proper compliance. The first is the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures (UGESP), which are guidelines that require employers to carefully inspect the processes they use to hire, promote, or terminate employees, and assure that those processes are fair and nondiscriminatory. First issued in 1978, the UGESP was designed by several government agencies as a nationwide policy to help achieve the national goal of equal employment opportunity, and it applies to both private and public employers. According to the guidelines, employers need to keep detailed records of applicants for employment and promotion. If a company’s current practices produce a deficiency of women or minority employees, the company must conduct a validity study to show that the imbalance was not discriminatory (Uniform guidelines on employee selection procedures, 2010).

             Suppose, for example, that you owned a metal-fabrication company and all of the metal-lathe workers that you hired were White males. Using a validity study, you might show that your hiring criteria for those employees involved a specialized mathematics test that would legitimately identify workers who would be good metal-lathe operators. It then turned out that only White male applicants performed well on that specialized test. This would show that your hiring practice was not inherently discriminatory, and that, instead, your choice was dependent on your pool of candidates. If a complaint of employment discrimination were ever brought against you, the validity study would be evidence in your defense.

             The UGESP aims at weeding out discriminatory hiring and promotion practices. However, a second government protocol, known as an _affirmative action plan_ (AAP), focuses more aggressively on assuring that employers implement affirmative action in their employment practices. In some cases, affirmative action plans are mandatory; in others, they are voluntary. The OFCCP requires contractors with 50 or more employees and government contracts of $50,000 to develop these plans. However, the EEOC advises all private-sector companies to devise voluntary affirmative action plans as a way of addressing deficiencies in their hiring and promotion procedures, especially as might be revealed by the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures.

             It is not enough for businesses to merely create an affirmative action plan; they must also make a good-faith effort to put the plan into practice. According to the OFCCP, “good faith efforts may include expanded efforts in outreach, recruitment, training and other activities to increase the pool of qualified minorities and females” (2002). The government recognizes the controversial nature of preferential-treatment policies and potential accusations of reverse discrimination. Accordingly, the OFCCP has stated that “the actual selection decision [for hiring or promotion] is to be made on a nondiscriminatory basis” (2002). The EEOC has stated further that “a voluntary affirmative action plan cannot unnecessarily trammel the rights of non-targeted groups, usually non-minorities or men” (1997).

             The required components of an affirmative action plan are listed in the Federal Code of Regulations, and the OFCCP provides a sample plan that companies can use as a model (Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, n.d.). Each organization is required to devise its own plan, and there is great latitude in how each can arrange its plan’s components. However, certain elements are required, and the plans often fall into two parts: one for minorities and women, and another for veterans and individuals with disabilities. The main components of affirmative action plans regarding women and minorities are:

• _Determining whether women and minorities are underrepresented within the company_. This involves listing the number of women and minority workers and the various jobs that they hold within a company. This, then, is statistically compared to the availability of women and minority workers in the relevant job market outside the company.

• _Establishing goals and programs to address underrepresentation_. This may involve more strategic use of recruitment and job-opening advertisements, and EEO training for supervisors and all other employees.

• _Conducting an internal audit of hiring, promotion, and termination procedures to detect problem areas_. This involves a statistical comparison of, on the one hand, women and minority workers who have been hired, promoted, or terminated and, on the other, men and nonminority workers within the same job groups.

The main components of affirmative action plans regarding veterans and individuals with disabilities are:

• _Making a reasonable effort to accommodate the physical or mental limitations of veteran/ disable employees._ When determining the extent of such accommodations, financial cost and organizational necessity are factors that may be considered.

• _Disseminating veteran/disability policy information both internally and externally_. This may involve communicating EEO policies through job advertisements, employee training, and memos to employees.

• _Creating an audit and reporting system regarding compliance with veteran/disability policy_. This may involve annually reviewing company hiring and promotion procedures for indications of discrimination or stereotyping.

The plan regarding veterans and individuals with disabilities differs from the plan regarding women and minorities. No statistical comparison is needed between veterans and disabled workers within the company and those in the job market outside the company. Rather, the goal is to improve awareness of the conditions that create a discrimination-free environment for veterans and individuals with disabilities.

**Supreme Court Cases on Affirmative Action**

Since the 1970s, the U.S. Supreme Court has heard a series of cases on affirmative action policies, and those rulings have established that some policies are legally permitted under the U.S. Constitution while others are not. The court’s decisions, though, are made on a case-by-case basis, and do not always establish clear and uniform policies. One reason is that the makeup of the Supreme Court continually changes, with some justices being more sympathetic to affirmative action than others. Another reason is that the court cases themselves significantly differ in their details, even when on the surface they seem to be about the same issue. We will look at some of the famous Supreme Court cases that have wrestled with the nuances of affirmative action practices of businesses, universities, and government offices. We will consider them chronologically.

             The first important case, Regents of the University of California vs. Bakke (1978), involved a White man named Allan Bakke who twice applied to the school of medicine at the University of California, Davis, but was rejected both times, while less qualified minority applicants were admitted as part of a racial quota system that reserved 16 places for minorities. The court ruled that universities could take race into account when admitting students, but it was unconstitutional for them to use rigid racial quotas to increase minorities as the University of California had done.

             The university was required to admit Bakke. While the legal case ended there, the ruling has been continually debated by legal scholars and in the media. A case in point is the following comparison between the medical careers of Bakke and Patrick Chavis, one of the 16 minority candidates against whom Bakke was originally competing:

Bakke . . . ended up with a part-time anesthesiology practice in Rochester, Minnesota. Dr. Patrick Chavis, the African-American who allegedly “took Bakke’s place” in medical school, has a huge OB/GYN practice providing primary care to poor women in predominantly minority Compton. Bakke’s scores were higher, but who made the most of his medical school education? From whom did California taxpayers benefit more? (Rice & Hayden, 1995)

While Chavis’s story has frequently been used as a justification of the University of California’s quota system, the story flipped when Chavis was found guilty of gross negligence and incompetence in the treatment of three liposuction patients at his clinic, one of whom died. The lesson to be learned from this is that a social policy as widespread and complex as affirmative action cannot be judged on the success or failure of any isolated individual. There will always be some examples of great achievement and others of dismal failure, and these can never substitute for systematic and methodologically sound studies of the issue.

             In another case, _United Steelworkers of America v. Weber_ (1979), Brian Weber, a young White laboratory assistant at the Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corporation, applied for a special training program that would have resulted in a promotion. The company made an agreement with the United Steelworkers of America labor union that for every one White person accepted into such training programs, one Black person would also be accepted. The company had many more Whites than Blacks, and thus accepted some Black employees into the program ahead of White employees with more seniority. When Weber was not accepted into the program, he sued on the grounds that the decision violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The court ruled against Weber and in favor of his company. Affirmative action plans were acceptable, according to the court, when they aimed to correct a statistical imbalance but did not involve quotas. Thus, Kaiser did nothing wrong, since the one-for-one system was not, strictly speaking, based on quotas. The court’s decision was controversial, and one dissenting justice stated the company’s preferential treatment of blacks clearly violated the wording of Title VII, which prohibits discrimination for employment opportunities on the basis of race. The justice continued that, by siding with the Kaiser company against Weber, the court’s majority decision was reminiscent of “escape artists such as Houdini” insofar is it eluded the clear language of the law in Title VII and wrongly concluded that employers are “permitted to consider race in making employment decisions” (United Steelworkers of America v. Weber, dissenting opn. of J. Rehnquist, 222).

             Another important case regarding affirmative action in universities is _Grutter v. Bollinger_ (2003). Barbara Grutter, a White woman with strong academic credentials, was rejected from the University of Michigan’s law school. She sued on the grounds that the school had used race as a predominant factor, thus giving applicants belonging to certain minority groups a significantly greater chance of admission than students with similar credentials from disfavored racial groups. The court ruled in favor of the law school, indicating that the Constitution “does not prohibit the Law School’s narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body” (_Grutter v. Bollinger_, 343). The court clarified, though, that preferential-treatment policies cannot go on indefinitely:

Race-conscious admissions policies must be limited in time. This requirement reflects that racial classifications, however compelling their goals, are potentially so dangerous that they may be employed no more broadly than the interest demands. Enshrining a permanent justification for racial preferences would offend this fundamental equal protection principle. (_Grutter v. Bollinger_, 342)

The point is that even though preferential-treatment programs serve an important social purpose, they are potentially damaging and can only be used as temporary measures. The Court explicitly stated, “We expect that 25 years from now the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary” (Grutter v. Bollinger, 343).

             In _Ricci v. DeStefano_ (2009), a fire department in New Haven, Connecticut, administered a promotion exam to 118 applicants for the positions of captain and lieutenant. When the results came in, city officials determined that too few minority candidates had scored high enough on the exam, and thus they threw the results out, issuing no promotions. Nineteen firefighters, mostly White males, sued on the grounds of reverse discrimination. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the firefighters and maintained that the city had violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act by engaging in “race-based decision making” when discarding the test results (_Ricci v. DeStefano_, slip op. at 19).

             All of these Supreme Court cases specifically involve questions about preferential-treatment policies, and whether they violate the rights of Whites. While the rulings differ in many respects, a consistent pattern emerges regarding the permissibility of quota systems in affirmative action programs. Generally speaking, the court considers quotas discriminatory against whites; however, the government can rightfully order companies to meet gender and minority quotas when they have repeatedly engaged in discriminatory practices.

             A final Supreme Court case on affirmative action is not about reverse discrimination against whites, but instead about the ability of women and minority employees to sue their employers for discriminatory practices. The 2011 case, Wal-Mart v. Dukes, was the largest gender-discrimination case to that point in history. Betty Dukes, a 54-year-old Walmart employee, sued the company for sex discrimination when she was denied training that would have led to a promotion. Her suit, though, was a class action on behalf of 1.5 million female employees who, like herself, she claimed, were also denied promotion within the company because of their gender-discriminatory employment practices. Walmart argued that the class-action lawsuit was unjustified, since the 1.5 million female employees had different jobs with different supervisors at 3,400 different stores nationwide, and did not have enough in common to be combined together into a single suit. The Supreme Court agreed with Walmart and threw out the case. What this means is that it may be more difficult for victims of systematic discrimination to bring class-action lawsuits against their employers; they may only be able to bring suits on an individual basis. That makes a major difference in the deterrence effect that potential lawsuits could have on businesses. A class action suit like Dukes’s, if successful, could have cost Walmart billions of dollars. By contrast, the damages of a lawsuit by a single individual might only be in the thousands of dollars.

**RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS DISCRIMINATION**

**Conflict between Two Laws**

The First Amendment to the Constitution establishes freedom of religious expression:

• "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof"

And Title II of the Civil Rights act prohibits businesses from discriminating against customers:

• "All persons shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation, as defined in this section, without discrimination or segregation on the ground of race, color, religion, or national origin.

As firm as these two laws are, they come in conflict with each other when a business owner refuses to accommodate a customer on the basis of the owner's deeply held religious convictions. One example of this is with pharmacies that refuse to sell contraception to customers. This was the situation in three Walgreens stores in Alabama and Georgia where pharmacists cited religious convictions as the reason for not dispensing the Plan B contraception to male customers for their female partners, even though such purchases were legal.

             Similar conflicts arise when businesses refuse to provide services to homosexuals based on religious objections. In one case, the owner of a cake shop in Colorado turned away a customer who wanted a cake for a same-sex marriage. The business owner said “I’ll make you birthday cakes, shower cakes, sell you cookies and brownies, I just don’t make cakes for same-sex weddings” (Craig v. Masterpiece). In another case a florist in the state of Washington was sued by a long-time customer when she refused on religious grounds to provide him with flowers for his same-sex wedding (Ingersoll v. Arlene’s Flowers). In yet another case, a social work graduate student at Eastern Michigan University refused to treat a gay student because her religious convictions prevented her from affirming homosexual lifestyles. She was subsequently expelled from her University's program for being in violation of the American Counseling Association code of ethics which stipulates that counselors must not "engage in discrimination based on . . . sexual orientation" (Ward v. Wilbanks).

**Elane Photography v. Willock**

One case that has received widespread attention is that of Elaine Huguenin, Owner of Elane Photography in New Mexico, who turned down an email request from Vanessa Willock to photograph a same-sex commitment ceremony. Huguenin responded saying "We do not photograph same-sex weddings". Willock sued and eventually the New Mexico Supreme Court ruled in favor of Willock. In many ways Elane Photography never stood a chance because explicit wording in the New Mexico Human Rights Act that prohibits public accommodations discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. While the U.S. Civil Rights act prohibits public accommodations discrimination against "race, color, religion, or national origin", New Mexico's act is stronger and its full list of protected classes includes "race, religion, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, spousal affiliation or physical or mental handicap."

             Elane Photography denied discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation, and said that its motivation was that it "did not want to convey through pictures the story of an event celebrating an understanding of marriage that conflicts with [its] beliefs." The Court maintained that Elane Photography misunderstood the issue. If it merely "took photographs on its own time and sold them at a gallery, or if it was hired by certain clients but did not offer its services to the general public" then the law would not apply to them. But once they became a business and put themselves out publically for hire, the public accommodations law applies. To exempt them in this case on religious grounds would allow any creative business to refuse service to any member of a protected class. The Court noted that an African American photographer could refuse to photograph a KKK rally since political group membership is not a protected class in New Mexico. However, a KKK photographer could not refuse to photograph an African American since race is a protected class.

             In the Court Ruling, Judge Richard C. Bosson, who wrote the concurring opinion, made it clear why civil rights won out over religious freedom. New Mexico's Human Rights Act makes sexual-orientation discrimination "just as intolerable as discrimination directed toward race, color, national origin, or religion," and Elane Photography's owners cannot turn away gay customers any more than "they could refuse to photograph African-Americans or Muslims." According to Bosson, this case is an important lesson that in a pluralistic society where "all of us must compromise, if only a little, to accommodate the contrasting values of others." Such compromise, Bosson concluded, "is part of the glue that holds us together as a nation" and "it is the price of citizenship" that the owners of Elane Photography must pay. (Elane Photography v. Willock)

**Religious Freedom Laws and the Right to Refuse Service**

In the aftermath of cases like Craig v. Masterpiece and Elane Photography v. Willock, legislatures in several states have proposed laws to allow businesses the right to refuse service based on religious convictions. Some bills explicitly target sexual orientation, such as one in South Dakota that would prohibit lawsuits against a business “for refusing to serve a person or couple based on sexual orientation” (SD SB128, 2014). Others do not mention sexual orientation or any other issue, but seek to elevate the right of religious freedom to a point where it would trump other considerations. For example, Arizona's "Religious Freedom" bill says that "state action shall not substantially burden a person's exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability" (AZ SB1602, 2014). That is, no law can prevent someone from practicing a required component of their faith, even in situations that might otherwise legitimately restrict a person's speech or conduct. Thus, religious freedom would outweigh sexual-orientation freedom. The bill passed Arizona's legislature, but was vetoed by the governor after a heated public debate. Mitt Romney stated that, if passed, the Arizona law "would have allowed people to use religion as a fig leaf for prejudice."

             The American Civil Liberties Union, which opposes such laws, argues that there is nothing new about claiming a right to discriminate in the name of religion. "In the 1960s, we saw institutions object to laws requiring integration in restaurants because of sincerely held beliefs that God wanted the races to be separate. . . . In those cases, we recognized that requiring integration was not about violating religious liberty; it was about ensuring fairness. It is no different today."

**CONCLUSION**

We opened this chapter looking at affirmative action in India. There are defenders of India’s radical policy who argue that it is essential for reducing economic differences between its ethnic groups (Deshpande, 2006). But in his book _Affirmative Action in India and the United States_, economist Thomas Sowell argued that India’s efforts at boosting the social level of untouchables have been a failure: “It is hard to escape the conclusion that affirmative action in India has produced minimal benefits to those most in need and maximum resentments and hostility toward them on the part of others.” According to Sowell, while untouchables have had special positions open to them in universities, businesses, and governments, comparatively few have been able to acquire the skills to move into those positions. For a teenager whose life experience has been salvaging scrap metal from a garbage dump, it makes little difference if law schools have special spots available to students who are untouchables. The odds are slim that such a teenager will succeed in even getting a high-school diploma.

             Sowell’s assessment of affirmative action programs throughout the world was the same, and he argued that people in the United States can learn by observing patterns of failures elsewhere. One such pattern is that every country claims that its problem with discrimination against minorities is unique, which justifies its policies of preferential treatment. Further, Sowell wrote, in all of these countries “considerable effort has been made to depict such policies as ‘temporary,’ even when in fact these preferences turn out not only to persist but to grow” (2004, p. 2). The reason, he explained, is that politicians would be blamed for saying no to them, whereas it is much easier to just say yes (Robinson & Sowell, 2004). Another pattern is that when affirmative action policies are set in place, members of majority groups often cheat the system by getting themselves reclassified as members of a minority group—based on very remote minority ancestry—and thus take advantage of special opportunities for minorities. Perhaps most importantly, Sowell argued that there often are not adequate statistical data to show the progress of groups that have been given preferential treatment. Even when such data do exist, it is difficult “to determine how much of that progress was due to preferential policies, rather than to other factors at work at the same time” (Sowell, 2004, p. 19). Nevertheless, Sowell argued, countries push on with their affirmative action programs in the absence of any good data that it works.

             Sowell’s point is that the problems of discrimination are not unique to the United States, nor are the problems with preferential treatment. To some extent, many people in the United States share Sowell’s skeptical attitudes about affirmative action policies. Nationwide surveys on this subject are routinely taken, and not surprisingly, the results depend on whether those policies involve preferential treatment. When asked “Do you generally favor or oppose affirmative action programs for racial and ethnic minorities?,” 56% were in favor of such programs, 36% were opposed to them, and 9% were unsure. When asked the same question about affirmative action programs for women, 63% were in favor, 29% opposed, and 9% unsure. However, attitudes changed when preferential treatment was a factor. When asked “Do you think members of some racial groups should get preference for jobs in private companies so that the workforce has the same racial makeup as its community?,” only 21% said yes, while 74% said no and 5% were unsure (“Race and Ethnicity,” 2004).

             Preferential treatment policies are controversial in the United States and everywhere else in the world where they have been put into practice. Public support might be stronger for these programs if it could be shown with some certainty that they are indeed successful in improving the conditions of historically disadvantaged groups, and they will not continue indefinitely. The problem, though, is that discrimination and its devastating effects on minorities are the consequence of hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of years of prejudicial tradition. It is unrealistic to expect that such a historically rooted problem can be solved with just a few decades of policy changes, and it is understandable that “temporary” policies of preferential treatment have become ongoing features of social policy.

**INTRODUCTION**

In the early twentieth century, journalist Robert L. Ripley traveled around the world gathering stories of strange rituals, which he published in his popular newspaper column “Believe It or Not.” One man sat and stared at the sun for fifteen years, which ultimately blinded him and made him incapable of moving his legs from inactivity. Another was buried alive for 40 days in suspended animation and survived.  Our fascination with bizarre practices of other cultures is no less prominent today. Some foreign practices amuse us, such as that of Japanese men who tattoo their entire bodies. Others make us squeamish, such as a Latin American culinary practice of eating handfuls of live bugs in tortillas. But other foreign cultural practices spark a moral reaction, such as countries that impose harsh penalties on women who have premarital sex, even execution. In the U.S., by contrast, premarital sex is normal behavior and, according to one study, since the 1950s 95% of Americans have had premarital sex (Lawrence B. Finer, “Trends in Premarital Sex). According to another study, 60-70% of Americans under age 55 believe that such behavior is morally acceptable (Gallup “Values and Beliefs Poll”). Attitudes about many sexual behaviors are especially diverse from culture to culture with issues such as homosexuality, public nudity, polygamy, polyamory, adultery, pornography, and prostitution. Reactions can radically differ not only from country to country, but also within the same country from one subculture to another, or at differing points in time.

             These culturally-conflicting standards of behavior directly challenge the idea that there is a fixed standard of morality for everyone, and they make us wonder whether morality reduces to mere social convention. For centuries, moral philosophers have reflected on the philosophical problems raised by clashing social values. The key question is whether moral standards exist independently of human social creations, and there are two competing answers to this question. The theory of _moral objectivism_ holds that moral standards do indeed exist independently of human social creations, and _moral relativism_ holds that they are just human inventions. This is not simply an issue of anthropological curiosity concerning how different people and cultures view morality. Instead, it is an issue of whether _my_ and _your_ specific moral obligations are grounded in nothing other than cultural approval. Moral objectivism says that they are, and moral relativism says that they are not.

             The essential differences between moral relativism and moral objectivism hinge on their answers to these three questions:

• Is morality objective?

• Are moral standards unchanging?

• Are moral standards universal?

Regarding the first question, relativists hold that moral standards are purely human inventions that are created either by individual people or human societies. Objectivists, by contrast, hold that moral standards are not created by human beings or human societies, but instead are grounded in some facts that are external to people and society. According to many objectivists, they exist in a higher spirit-realm that is completely apart from the physical world around us. Regarding the second question, relativists hold that moral standards change throughout time and from society to society. For objectivists, though, genuine moral truths are eternal and do not change throughout time or from location to location. No matter where you are in the world or at what point in history, the same principles apply. Regarding the third question, relativists hold that moral standards do not necessarily apply universally to all people or social groups, and their application depends on human preference. But for objectivists, there is a uniform set of moral standards that is the same for all people, regardless of human differences like race, gender, wealth and social standing.

             In this chapter we will first look at the theory of moral relativism then moral objectivism.

**MORAL RELATIVISM**

The issue of moral relativism was one of the first hotly debated topics in Western moral philosophy, and the views of early relativists remain even today largely unchanged. We will begin by looking at their theories. Then, as now, there are two distinct versions of moral relativism. One, called _individual relativism_, is the view that each _person_ creates his or her own moral standards. The other, called _cultural_ relativism, is the view that _societies_, not the individual person, creates moral standards which are then authoritative over everyone within that society.

**Individual Relativism: Protagoras**

The most famous champion of moral relativism in the early days of Greek philosophy was Protagoras (485–420 BCE) who stated that “man is the measure of all things—of things that are that they are, and of things that are not that they are not.” Most simply, this means that people set their own standard of truth in all judgments. Only fragments of Protagoras’s original writings survive, so we are left to speculate about the precise meaning of his famous statement. Two important ancient Greek philosophers, Plato (428–348 BCE) and Sextus Empiricus (fl. 200 CE), offer us some guidance in the following passages from their writings:

Does Protagoras not say that things are to you such as they appear to you, and to me such as they appear to me. . . are we to say, with Protagoras, that the wind is cold to him who is cold, and not to him who is not? [Plato, _Theaetetus_ 152a]

By “measure” he means the standard, and by “things” objects; so he is implicitly saying that human beings are the standard for all objects, of those that are that they are and of those that are not that they are not. For this reason he posits only what is apparent to each person, and thus introduces relativity. [Sextus Empiricus, _Outlines of Pyrrhonism_, 1.32]

There are three points to consider about Protagoras’s statement and the interpretations of it by Plato and Sextus. First, when Protagoras states that “man is the measure of all things,” “man” refers to individual humans, not to human society collectively. In this sense, then, _each person’s_ judgment, rather than _society’s_ judgment, constitutes the standard of truth. Protagoras, then, is a proponent of individual relativism, which is the view that moral obligations are grounded in each person’s own approval. Again, this stands in contrast to cultural relativism, which holds that moral obligations are grounded in the approval of social cultures.

             Secondly, there are two possible interpretations of Protagoras’s statement:

• Each person’s private judgment constitutes the standard of truth _for everyone_.

• Each person’s private judgment constitutes the standard of truth _for whoever makes that judgment_.

Plato and Sextus both appear to go with the second interpretation, and for good reason too. The first interpretation means that my personal judgments become the standard for you and everyone else. On the first view, when I judge that honey is sweet, or the door is brown, or that stealing is wrong, I am making these judgments not just for myself, but for all of the human race. It is my judgment alone that establishes what is universally true. That seems pretty egotistical since I know that I regularly make mistakes, and there are some subjects like nuclear physics that I know nothing at all about. Further, suppose that, for you, honey is bitter, the door is gray, and stealing is OK, which completely conflict with my judgments. Each of us, then, are creating conflicting standards of truth for everyone and the whole notion of a “standard of truth” becomes pointless. However, according to the second interpretation, the authority of my private judgments does not extend any further than myself: through my personal judgments, I create my own standards of truth, and, through your judgments you create yours. For example, if I taste some honey and find it sweet, then my judgment that it is sweet _makes_ it true for me. And if you, by contrast, do not find honey sweet when you taste it, then it is true for you that honey is not sweet. In this situation, individual relativism makes sense, since I am describing how something tastes to me based on the physiology of my taste buds, and you based on your own physiology. If we happen to agree with each other, that is fine, and if we disagree, that is also fine.

             A third issue is the sweeping nature of Protagoras’ relativism as reflected in the second half of his statement: “man is the measure of all things—of things that are, that they are, and of things that are not that they are not.” While the wording here is a little awkward, the central point is that individual people create their own truth, even to the extent that something exists or does not exist. If Protagoras’s relativism applied only to minor issues of perception, like how honey tastes to different people, it would not be very remarkable. But Protagoras pushes individual relativism to an extreme, holding that the truth of _everything_ is relative to the person. This is where many of us have problems with his position, since some truths do not seem to be relative. For example, suppose I believe it is true that “2 plus 3 equals 7” or “Tokyo is in France.” According to Protagoras, these statements are true _for me_, even though our normal reaction is that these statements are just plain false. For Protagoras, the same individual relativism that applies to judgments about honey or addition or Tokyo also applies to judgments about morality, such as my belief that stealing is wrong. We all have our own perceptions about what things are good and evil, just and unjust. In this sense, each of our moral views is true for us respectively.

**Cultural Relativism: The Greek Skeptics**

Protagoras’s individualism is just one approach to relativism, and it probably is not the best. It assumes that each person is his or her own island, independent of other people, regarding the perspectives of the world that each of us formulates, and moral standards that we adopt. On this view, I am the principal creator of truth and morality for myself. But we are not islands, and, instead, our perspectives of the world are shaped by the larger communities in which we are raised. It is through our families, friends, schools, religious affiliations, political institutions, and vocational connections that we collectively shape our standards. My personal views on the subject of proper sexual behavior, for example, were not fashioned by me, but rather instilled into me by those around me, particularly during an especially impressionable period of my development. Far from being independent creators of truth, we are instead clones of each other within our respective cultures and sub-cultures. Thus, if the concept of moral relativism is to be a plausible theory of the origins of moral standards, it is the cultural version that shows the most promise, not so much the individual approach.

             One of the earliest expressions of cultural relativism was offered by the ancient Greek historian Heroditus (484–425 BCE) who, after surveying the traditions of different regions, concluded that “everyone without exception believes his own native customs, and the religion he was brought up in, to be the best.” Heroditus’s point is that, not only do we all adopt the religious and ethical value systems of our respective cultures, but we typically go a step further and denounce foreign value systems as inferior to our own. This is the basic relativistic insight into morality that was systematized by ancient Greek philosophers of the skeptical tradition, the best surviving example of which is Sextus Empiricus. Drawing on anthropological data compiled by earlier Greek historians, Sextus gives example after example of moral standards that differ from one society or culture to another. These include attitudes about homosexuality, incest, cannibalism, human sacrifice, the killing of the elderly, infanticide, theft, and consumption of animal flesh.

             Sextus believes that this social diversity in and of itself is a good reason to adopt cultural relativism. The differing cultural attitudes are extreme, and Sextus clearly wants to shock us into thinking seriously about this diversity. Here is his account of differing attitudes concerning sexual morality:

Among the Persians it is the custom to practice homosexuality, but among the Romans it is forbidden by law to do that. For us adultery is forbidden, but among the Massegetae adultery is customarily accepted with indifference. . . . Among us it is forbidden to have sex with our mothers, but among the Persians it is the custom to have such marriages. The Egyptians marry their sisters, which is also forbidden by law among us. . . . Most men have sex with their wives in private, but the philosopher Crates did it with his wife publicly. Diogenes went around with one shoulder bare, but we go around with our customary clothes. [_Outlines of Pyrrhonism_, 1.14]

Sextus’s claim is sweeping: _every_ moral belief is grounded in the attitudes of particular cultures, which frequently clash with each other. The moral behavior of different societies conflict with each other, and the moral standards that they espouse also conflict. Sextus concludes that “the skeptic, seeing so great a diversity of usages, suspends judgment as to the natural existence of anything good or bad or, in general, fit or unfit to be done.” That is, we should doubt the existence of an independent and universal standard of morality, and instead regard moral standards as the result of cultural preferences.

             Sextus and other skeptics have a particular goal in mind in advancing cultural relativism. That goal is personal tranquility. Suppose I believe that there exists a fixed and objective standard of truth; suppose further that this standard guides all my actions. Since I see myself on the side of moral truth, I become morally outraged by those who do not follow these moral standards. Ultimately, I make myself miserable through my extreme convictions. However, once I seriously reflect on the wide diversity of cultural practices that Sextus describes, I will be more inclined to see that my own cultural practices are rooted in social customs. I will then get off my moral high horse and be content to accept the moral diversity that I see in other cultures.

**Later Defenders of Moral Relativism**

Shortly after the time of Sextus, both skepticism and moral relativism went into hibernation for around 1,000 years. During that era, philosophy throughout Europe developed under the guidance of the Medieval church, and within that theological system there was no room skeptics or relativists. Truths were clearly established—religious, moral and even scientific ones. Theologians recognized that the moral behavior varied among the different cultures around the world, but, as Thomas Aquinas argued, that is because such people habitually let their passions overpower their reason. Aquinas writes, “In some, reason is perverted by passion, or evil habit, or an evil disposition of nature. Thus, although theft is expressly contrary to the natural law, it was formerly not considered wrong among the Germans, as Julius Caesar relates” (ST, 2.1.94.4)

             But with the closing of the Middle Ages, Renaissance scholars took a keener interest in the writings of all of the ancient philosophers, including skeptics like Sextus Empiricus with his position on moral relativism. French philosopher Michel Montaigne (1533–1592) was among the first to do so, and in his essay titled “Of Custom” he defends cultural relativism by examining dozens of strange cultural practices from foreign countries. Focusing especially on sexually-related practices he writes that in one culture, unmarried women “may prostitute themselves to as many as they please,” and when they get pregnant, they can lawfully abort their fetuses “in the sight of everyone.” In another culture, male guests at weddings are invited to sleep with the bride even before the groom does, “and the greater number of them there is, the greater is her honor and the opinion of her ability and strength.” Montaigne describes one culture in which gender roles are strangely reversed: Houses of prostitution contain young men “for the pleasure of women,” and “wives go to war as well as the husbands.”

             Montaigne concludes that custom has the power to shape every possible kind of cultural practice. Although we pretend that morality is a fixed feature of nature, morality, too, is formed through custom: “The laws of conscience, which we pretend to be derived from nature, proceed from custom.” He argues further that peer pressure is so strong that we automatically approve of our society’s customs: “As everyone has an inward veneration for the opinions and manners approved of and received among his own people, no one can, without very great reluctance, depart from them, or apply himself to them without approval.” In his essay “Of Cannibals,” Montaigne writes similarly that “each man calls barbarism whatever is not his own practice; for indeed it seems we have no other test of truth and reason than the example and pattern of the opinions and customs of the country we live in.”

             As more appreciators of ancient skepticism appeared, so too did philosophical defenses of relativism. But the biggest boost to cultural relativism came with the development of the social sciences in the early twentieth-century. In his classic work _Folkways_ (1906), American sociologist William Graham Sumner (1840–1910) argues that the morality of a given society simply amounts to the folkways or traditions of that society. For Sumner, theories that try to ground morality in some absolute standard are misguided:

In the folkways, whatever is, is right. This is because they are traditional, and therefore con­tain in themselves the authority of the ancestral ghosts. When we come to the folkways we are at the end of our analysis. . . . Therefore rights can never be “natural” or “God-given,” or absolute in any sense. The morality of a group at a time is the sum of the taboos and prescriptions in the folkways by which right conduct is defined. [_Folkways_, 1.31]

Sumner argues that there are no exceptions to this: A society’s standards concerning slavery, abortion, killing of the elderly, and cannibalism only reflect that society’s traditional taboos and prescriptions. American anthropologist Ruth Benedict (1887-1948) argues similarly that morality consists simply of socially approved habits, which might be praised in some cultures, yet condemned in others. Social science, she argues, no longer attempts to ground morality in some fixed feature of human nature or metaphysical first principle. She writes,

We do not any longer make the mistake of deriving the morality of our own locality and decade directly from the inevitable constitution of human nature. We do not elevate it to the dignity of a first principle. We recognize that morality differs in every society, and is a convenient term for socially approved habits. Mankind has always preferred to say, “It is morally good,” rather than “It is habitual,” and the fact of this preference is matter enough for a critical science of ethics. But historically the two phases are synonymous. (“Anthropology of the Abnormal”, 1934)

Thus, for social scientists like Sumner and Benedict, the observable facts tell us that morality is simply a creation of human societies which often differ from one location to another.

             Moral relativism continues to be defended by philosophers today, and the key points associated with the tradition of cultural relativism are these:

·       Moral standards are created by society.

·       Moral standards vary from culture to culture.

·       There is no objective moral truth outside of what society establishes.

**The Argument for Cultural Relativism from Social Diversity**

Let us look more closely at the underlying argument for cultural relativism that we find especially in Sextus, Montaigne and Sumner. In its simplest form the argument is this:

1. Moral standards of behavior differ from society to society.

2. These differing moral standards are grounded either in objective moral truths or only in social custom.

3. It is difficult to explain how these differing moral standards are grounded in objective moral truth.

4. Therefore, it is more reasonable to believe that these differing moral standards are grounded only in social custom.

Consider now the argument premise by premise. Premise 1 states that, as a sociological fact, different cultures have different moral standards. Sextus and Montaigne attempted to defend this point with the best available sociological information that they had access to in their day. Sumner, guided by more modern methods of social fact gathering, presented his own data for the same point. He argues, for example, that our observations will clearly reveal that even taboos against incest are “by no means universal or uniform, or attended by the same intensity of repugnance.” Social scientists since Sumner continue to present data supporting cultural variation in moral matters, presumably with even more scientific rigor. If the observations by these social scientists are accurate, then premise 1 also seems plausible.

             Premise 2 states that there are only two viable and competing options for understanding where moral standards come from. They are grounded in either (1) an objective source of moral truth that is independent of human society or (2) social custom. Over the centuries, moral objectivists have proposed a variety of objective sources of moral truth in some more stable level of reality beyond mere human social custom, such as eternal truths, laws of nature, or commands of God. Premise 2 then, is at least a plausible way of seeing the possible foundations of moral standards: Either they are grounded in a more stable level of reality _beyond_ social custom, or they are grounded _in_ social custom.

             Premise 3 states that it is hard to see how moral standards are grounded in an objective truth if those standards change from culture to culture. If moral objectivism has anything practical to say about our moral standards it is that objective moral truths should shape our cultural practices and the moral standards that we adopt. For example, we condemn stealing in our culture because some objective moral truth tells us that stealing is wrong. However, when we consider the wide variety of conflicting moral standards in societies around the world, it does not seem reasonable that they all are grounded in a universal and objective truth. On face value, then, premise 3 also seems credible.

             From these three premises the conclusion in statement 4 immediately follows: moral standards are grounded in social custom, which, compared to moral objectivism, more reasonably explains the moral diversity that we see. Suppose, for example, that I believe that polygamy is immoral while my friend from Saudi Arabia believes that polygamy is morally permissible. The more reasonable explanation is that our respective cultures influence our individual beliefs, rather than the objectivist alternative that objectively grounded beliefs influence our cultures. Cultural relativism, then, is the most reasonable explanation for why our moral standards mimic our culture.

**CRITICISMS OF MORAL RELATIVISM**

Although the argument from cultural relativism seems plausible at face value, critics have pointed out some flaws with it. We will consider three.

**Plato’s Criticism: Relativism is Self-Refuting**

Plato gives us one of the first criticisms of relativism, and, while he does not specifically target moral relativism, what he has to say certainly applies to relativist claims about moral standards. He argues that Protagoras’s relativist position that “Man is the Measure of All Things” is self-refuting. That is, if I am the judge of what is true and false for me, then I can simply judge that Protagoras’s theory of individual relativism is itself false, and it thereby becomes false. His precise words are here:

If neither Protagoras nor the multitude thought, as indeed they do not think, that man is the measure of all things, must it not follow that the truth of which Protagoras wrote would be true to no one? But if you suppose that he himself thought this, and that the multitude does not agree with him, you must begin by allowing that in whatever proportion the many are more than one, in that proportion his truth is more untrue than true. [_Theaetetus_]

There are different ways of interpreting Plato’s criticism, but one way goes like this:

1. According to Protagoras, if I judge something to be false, then it is false for me.

2. Suppose that I judge it false that individual people are the measure of all truth.

3. Therefore, it is false for me that individual people are the measure of all truth.

Indeed, Plato hit the nail on the head with regard to Protagoras’s theory of individual relativism. The central problem is with the sweeping claim that the truth of _all_ things, which includes the theory of individual relativism itself, is relative to me. Although the truth of many things certainly is relative to me, such as how something tastes, it is simply false that the truth of _all_ things is relative to me. The most that Protagoras can justifiably say, then, is that “man is the measure of _some_ things,” which is such a weak claim that it no longer even counts as individual relativism.

             How might the moral relativist respond to Plato’s criticism? The charge of self-refutation is a common one in philosophy, especially when a philosopher makes a sweeping claim, such as Protagoras did. A typical way out of the problem is to say that the claim is not so much a sweeping _rule_ as it is a sweeping _recommendation_ for understanding the boundaries of knowledge. When pushed to its limits, this recommendation will indeed undermine itself, but that does not make the recommendation any less valuable; it could remain an important guideline or rule of thumb for how we understand our world. This is certainly a response that the moral relativist might give to Plato.

             But let us try a different way of defending relativism. While Plato targeted his argument specifically at Protagoras’s individual relativism, we can also construct a cultural relativist version of the argument, and this is where things get interesting:

1. According to Protagoras, if my society judges something to be false, then it is false for my society.

2. Suppose that my society judges it false that human societies are the measure of all truth.

3. Therefore, it is false for my society that human societies are the measure of all truth.

In this form Plato’s argument is not really a criticism of cultural relativism but, rather, a confession by the objectivist of the delusional world of objective truths that he has created for himself. Suppose that Protagoras is right that there is no objective truth or falsehood, but only that which my society creates (premise 1). Well, in my society, we don’t like the idea of cultural relativism and we say that it is false (premise 2). Cultural relativism thereby is false for my society (conclusion). From the cultural relativist’s standpoint, this is precisely what the objectivist is doing: he is using the power of his culture to forge a conception of objective truth which in turn denies that very power of his culture. Thus, Protagoras’s relativism does not undermine itself; rather, it is Plato’s argument that undermines objectivism. This twist is also embedded in the original individual relativist version of Plato’s argument, but it is more transparent in the cultural relativist version.

**Balfour’s Criticism: Many Customs Are Simply Depraved**

Over the centuries, critics of cultural relativism have attacked the argument from social diversity on several grounds. One response is to challenge premise 3 in the above version of that argument, which states that “It is difficult to explain how these differing moral standards are grounded in objective moral truth.” The entire argument from social diversity will topple if we can offer a cogent explanation as to how differing moral standards might be grounded in an objective reality.

             Scottish philosopher James Balfour (1705–1795) attempted to do just that. He argued that, even if moral customs do vary over time and from place to place, there is still an underlying ideal moral standard that these cultures simply ignore. The whole batch of these cultures are simply corrupt, and these corrupt values only highlight true morality all the more. He writes,

[Cultural relativism] leads to this unavoidable consequence, that whatever any set of men, or even any individual person, may think fit to do, however criminal in itself, must yet be deemed a virtue; because it is immediately agreeable to those who practice it.

            But let us suppose that a whole nation should universally countenance a bad practice, this never would alter the nature of things, nor give sanction to vice. . . .

            But so far are the depraved customs of the multitude, or even the practices of the great from being the just standard of morality, that virtue shines forth with the greater luster from amidst bad practices; and even an universal corruption renders it the more conspicuous. [_Delineation_, 1753, 5]

Here are Balfour’s main points in the above quote:

•  The theory of cultural relativism wrongly implies that any action, however bad in itself, will be morally permissible if society as a whole approves of it.

•  Even if an entire country approved of an inherently bad action, this would not alter genuine moral truth.

• The existence of true morality becomes apparent when we are confronted with immoral customs.

Thus, Balfour is arguing that social customs are not the same thing as true morality: societies may at times adopt depraved customs, but this has no bearing on the existence of true morality. Such social customs, regardless of how many people approve of them, are in reality immoral. From Balfour’s perspective, there exists an objective set of moral truths, and our particular moral beliefs become distorted as we try to perceive them through our particular cultures. For example, if I believe polygamy is immoral and my friend from Saudi Arabia believes it is moral, then at least one of us, and perhaps both of us, might have a distorted understanding of objective moral truth. For Balfour, then, premise 3 in the argument from social diversity fails: we can indeed explain the relationship between our differing moral standards and objective moral truth.

             How might the cultural relativist respond to Balfour’s criticism? The weak link in Balfour’s argument is his test for determining which of our customs are depraved and which reflect true morality. His solution is that true morality “shines forth with the greater luster from amid bad practices.” That is, the contrast between depraved customs and true morality is so pronounced that we all can intuitively see the difference. But Balfour’s solution does not work. Balfour may have genuinely believed that some moral standards “shine forth” as more legitimate than others. But it probably never occurred to Balfour that the strength of his moral convictions might have been shaped by his own eighteenth-century Scottish moral tradition, which was heavily influenced by Calvinistic religious beliefs. For example, in the Scotland of his day, it was immoral to hold or attend theatrical performances. In a different culture, other moral standards might “shine forth” to those people as more legitimate than those that Balfour held to be true. In short, since our internal intuitions themselves may be products of our respective cultures, we cannot safely appeal to these same intuitions to determine which of our practices are depraved and which reflect true morality.

             Other objectivist moral philosophers have offered a variety of more stringent litmus tests to help distinguish between true morality and depraved customs; these proposed tests include rationality, natural law, religious scripture, and human nature. Although these appear to be more rigorous than Balfour’s test, they nevertheless all fall prey to the same problem that Balfour’s did. That is, they all may be products of their respective cultures. A chemical test to determine the pH level of swimming pools will work the same around the world. A mathematical test to determine the structural integrity of bridge designs will also work the same around the world. But notions of rationality, natural law, scripture, and human nature are matters of debate and do not represent uniform standards. Ultimately, if we cannot offer a uniform test to distinguish true morality from depraved customs, then we should accept premise 3 in the argument from social diversity.

**Rachels’s Criticism: Some Key Standards Do Not Vary**

Another reaction to the above argument for cultural relativism from social diversity is to challenge premise one that “moral standards of behavior differ from society to society.” Maybe if we look hard enough, we will actually find basic moral standards that are _the same_ in all cultures. Contemporary American philosopher James Rachels (1941-2003) has argued this point. According to him, there are three core moral standards that societies hold in common: (1) caring for children, (2) truth telling, and (3) prohibitions against murder. For Rachels, these are all necessary conditions for the survival of a society since, if a society consistently violated any one of these, it would disintegrate. He writes,

There is a general theoretical point here, namely, that _there are some moral rules that all societies will have in common, because those rules are necessary for society to exist._ The rules against lying and murder are two examples. And in fact, we do find these rules in force in all viable cultures. Cultures may differ in what they regard as legitimate exceptions to the rules, but this disagreement exists against a background of agreement on the larger issues. Therefore, it is a mistake to overestimate the amount of difference between cultures. Not every moral rule can vary from society to society. [_Elements of Moral Philosophy_, 1986]

As to caring for children, all societies need to replenish their supply of educated and productive citizens, otherwise in only a few generations that society would die out. As to truth telling, the successful operation of industries, businesses, schools, and governments rests on the individuals involved trusting each other’s word. I would not buy groceries at my local store if I could not trust that the grocer would let me take home what I paid for. As to prohibitions against murder, if society allowed us to randomly kill other humans for sport or at whim, then everyone would head for the hills and stay as far from society as possible.

             The list of common standards does not need to stop with the three that Rachels mentions. Society would fall apart if there were no prohibition against stealing either privately held or publicly held property. Imagine what would happen, for example, if, to expand my garden, I simply annexed my neighbor’s backyard or the street in front of my house. Also, society must punish people for violating core moral standards, otherwise, the standards themselves would be empty words. So, by identifying common social standards as Rachels does, the critic of relativism raises serious questions about the truth of premise 1. What at first seems to be an obvious truth for relativists—that moral standards differ from culture to culture—now seems more like a hasty generalization.

             The relativist has two responses to Rachels. First, as to the specific core standards that Rachels cites, yes at first they appear to be common to all modern societies, but not in any uniform way. Take the core prohibition against murder, for example. There are many types of killing that are morally acceptable in some modern cultures, but not in others, such as those involving vigilante justice, honor killings, tribal feuds, political assassinations, suicide missions, extremely hazardous occupations, types of self-defense. To that list we can add ones from past civilizations, such as human sacrifice, religious inquisitions, deadly negligence of slaves, and public executions for trivial reasons. When people intentionally kill each other, they do it for some reason. The key question is whether there is a uniform moral standard that distinguishes justifiable reasons from unjustifiable reasons. There is not.  Societies have nevertheless survived amidst a diversity of inconsistent views about what counts as a justifiable killing. The same goes for the core standards of caring for children and truth telling. There is a diversity of inconsistent rules about what counts as proper care or being truthful with no uniform moral standard that distinguishes the justifiable from the unjustifiable.

             Second, there is at least one major area of morality that is indisputably variable from culture to culture, and that is with sexual morality. As described at the outset of this chapter, cultural attitudes vary dramatically—today and in the past—on the issues of premarital sex, homosexuality, public nudity, polygamy, polyamory, adultery, pornography, and prostitution. These are moral issues that we typically feel very strongly about, and in fact may involve the most important moral convictions that we have in our lives.

             The bottom line: the view is alive and well that moral standards of behavior differ from society to society, and if there are any truly uniform standards of morality we cannot clearly articulate them. Thus, the argument for cultural relativism appears to withstand the criticisms of it that we have so far looked at.

**MORAL OBJECTIVISM**

We turn now to examine moral objectivism, the rival theory to moral relativism. Again, moral objectivism holds that standards are “objective” in that they are not created by human beings or human societies, but instead are grounded in some facts that are external to human society. Further, genuine moral truths are unchanging throughout time or location, and these truths are universal in the sense that they are same for all people.

             Over the centuries, philosophers have proposed a variety of theories of moral objectivism, arguing that morality is grounded in the creative will of God, or the laws of nature, or in eternal truths. Some of these theories we will look at in later chapters, but our focus here will be on Plato’s moral objectivism. His was the first detailed philosophical account of the subject and is consequently the grandfather of succeeding theories.

**Plato’s Theory of the Moral Forms**

Plato’s basic position is that moral standards are grounded in a higher and more perfect realm of moral truth that exists outside of human society and the physical world around us. The heart of his account is his _theory of the Forms_. According to Plato, the universe consists of two distinct realms. First, there is a visible world of appearances, which contains physical objects such as rocks, chairs, cars, and people. Second, there is an intelligible world of the Forms, which contains universal abstractions such as mathematical principles and the moral principle of justice. “Form”, for Plato, is like a perfect pattern, model, or blueprint.

             To better explain, imagine that we could take a tour of the higher spirit-realm, assuming that such a place exists. We might first encounter spirits of the gods, of deceased people, and even of unborn. These are all conscious entities and are typically what people think of as inhabiting that realm. But as we move further along, we will encounter other things which are not conscious spirits. These would include the Forms (or perfect blueprints) of physical things of rocks and chairs and also mathematical Forms such as 2+3=5.

             Moving beyond physical and mathematical Forms on our tour, we come across the Forms of moral concepts such as justice, charity, honesty, and beauty. For Plato, these are the pure Forms of moral traits that people have. For example, every person on earth who exhibits the moral attribute of true justice must be modeled after or shaped by the perfect Form of justice. Finally, on our tour, we encounter the grandest Form of all—namely, the Form of the Good. Higher than justice and the other moral Forms, the Good is the source of ultimate moral perfection in the other moral Forms. Plato himself struggles to explain the nature of the Good. He argues that we cannot simply reduce the Good to qualities we commonly value, such as pleasure or wisdom. However, he argues, we all seek the Good and, like the sun, the Good illuminates everything that we know.

             Returning to the physical world, we see particular things around us, such as a bridge spanning a river or a man donating to charity. For Plato, these physical things are imperfectly molded from various mathematical and moral Forms. For example, when building a bridge across a river, we rely on calculations about stress points and other mathematical components. In Plato’s terminology, the particular physical things that we see _participate_ (_methexis_) in different abstract Forms. Thus, the structure of the bridge _participates_ in abstract mathematical Forms. The bridge, though, will never be perfect given the faulty material from which it is made. Similarly, when a person donates to charity, he participates in the moral Form of charity.

             Perhaps the strangest part of Plato’s theory is his explanation of how we obtain knowledge of the Forms. He describes this as a recollecting process (_anamnesis_): In a previous existence in the spirit-realm, we were directly acquainted with all of the Forms, but over the years we’ve suppressed our knowledge of them. To know the Forms, then, we must try to recollect them. His most graphic description of it is this:

Thus the soul, since it is immortal and has been born many times, and has seen all things both here and in the other world, has the knowledge of virtue or anything else which, as we see, it once possessed. All nature is akin, and the soul has learned everything, so that when a man has recalled a single piece of knowledge— _learned_ it, in ordinary language—there is no reason why he should not find out all the rest, if he keeps a stout heart and does not grow weary of the search, for seeking and learning are in fact nothing but recollection. (_Meno_, 81d)

He states here that the soul “has seen all things both here and in the other world”; it is in the “other world” that we encountered the Forms, and is a world in which our souls were not restrained either by our bodies or by physical things. He writes elsewhere that the body flusters, maddens, and imprisons the soul. The body is diseased, it destroys the value of life, and the true philosopher despises it. Thus, our bodies suppress the knowledge of the Forms that we had prior to birth, and we must struggle to recollect the Forms through the power of our rational minds.

             To summarize, these are the key points of Plato’s moral objectivism:

• Moral standards are eternal, unchanging, and nonphysical Forms.

• The highest moral value is the Form of the Good, which is ultimate moral perfection.

• People become moral by participating in the moral Forms.

• We gain moral knowledge by recollecting the moral Forms from a past-life encounter.

**Later Defenders of Objective Moral Forms**

Plato ranks as one of the most important and influential philosophers who ever lived, and his loyal followers have defended his objectivist view of the moral Forms from his own day until the present. An important case in point is the early Christian philosopher Augustine who held that, of all Greek philosophers, Plato came the closest to Christianity. While Augustine agreed with Plato that the Forms exist, he believed that they reside within the mind of God, and not, as Plato held, in some remote part of the cosmos independently of God. Augustine writes,

Where are we to believe that these reasons [by which God created things] exist, if not in the very mind of the Creator? Indeed he saw nothing outside of him that could serve him as a type for what he wanted. To make such a supposition would be sacrilegious. [_83 Questions_, 46]

Augustine also rejected Plato’s view that we gain knowledge of the Forms by recollecting them from a past-life encounter, for, the concept of soul’s preexistence goes against Christian theology. Rather, Augustine held that humans receive knowledge of the Forms through divine illumination, that is, by God directly revealing eternal truths to our minds in the way that light reveals the physical world to our eyes.

             Some Platonists in succeeding centuries held to Plato’s original notion of the moral Forms, but many followed Augustine’s Christian version. Just one example of the latter is British idealist philosopher Hastings Rashdall (1858-1924) who argued that the “moral ideal” can only exist in the mind of God, which God then reveals to us:

A moral ideal can exist nowhere and no how but in a mind; an absolute moral ideal can exist only in a Mind from which all Reality is derived. Our moral ideal can only claim objective validity in so far as it can rationally be regarded as the revelation of a moral ideal eternally existing in the mind of God [_The Theory of Good and Evil_, 1907, 2.2.1.4]

Whether it is Plato’s original version or Augustine’s modified one, the theory of the moral Forms stands in opposition to every component of moral relativism. For, the moral Forms are not created by individual people or society, they do not vary from culture to culture, and they constitute objective truths outside of what society establishes.

**CRITICISMS OF PLATO’S THEORY**

Just as there have been defenders of Plato since ancient times, there also have been two millennia of criticisms of virtually every aspect of Plato’s theories. We will look at three that target his theory of the moral Forms, one from his own time and two more recent criticisms.

**Aristotle’s Criticism: The Forms Do Not Add to Our Knowledge**

Plato’s greatness as a philosopher is rivaled perhaps only by that of his pupil Aristotle (384–322 BCE). The two disagree on many issues, but particularly so concerning Plato’s theory of the Forms. This dispute between teacher and student is vividly depicted in a painting by Renaissance artist Raphael (1483–1520) entitled _The School of Athens_. In this painting, an elderly Plato and a young Aristotle are walking side by side down a staircase. Plato is pointing up at the sky to express his view that ultimate reality exists above and beyond the physical world. Aristotle, though, is pointing down at the ground to express his view that ultimate reality is embedded right here in the physical and tangible world. For Aristotle, there simply is no higher objective realm of the Forms. Among his various criticisms of Plato, Aristotle charges that the idea of the Forms in no way helps us understand the nature of particular objects around us:

Principally, one might discuss the question what at all the Forms contribute to sensible things, either to those that are eternal or to those that come into being and cease to be. For they cause neither movement nor any change in them. Again they help in no way towards the knowledge of the other things, for they are not even the substance of these otherwise they would have been in them. Nor do they help towards knowledge of their being, if they are not in the particulars which share in them. [_Metaphysics_, 1.9]

Aristotle argues here that the Forms, as Plato describes them, do not explain anything about the nature or behavior of things in this world. They are not responsible for causing things to move or change, they are not embedded in the substance of objects, and they have no real connection with anything.

             In essence, according to Aristotle, the Forms are useless in explaining the nature of things, and they only confuse things by introducing unneeded concepts. Suppose that I want to better understand the notion of charity, and I read in Plato that the true nature of charity rests in the Form of charity. Not only does this fail to advance my understanding of charity, but it also clutters my head with unneeded metaphysical entities. Insofar as we understand a “Form” of charity, we do so by studying specific instances of it. The medieval philosopher William of Ockham (c. 1285–1349) recommended that we avoid multiplying entities beyond what we actually need. According to this principle, known more popularly as “Ockham’s Razor,” we should stick with our most metaphysically simple explanation. Aristotle anticipates Ockham’s recommendation by pointing out that Plato’s account of the Forms merely adds useless metaphysical baggage.

             How might we defend Plato against this criticism? Aristotle and Ockham are correct that, as a rule, our theories should contribute to our knowledge and that we should rid our theories of pointless complications. However, this criticism loses sight of an important motivation behind Plato’s theory. The physical world around us is highly imperfect. If we try to understand the concept of charity by surveying this world, we will arrive at an inadequate concept. Most people are not as charitable as they should be. And even when we are charitable, we often act from ulterior motives, such as to enhance our reputation. There may be very few truly representative examples of charity upon which we can draw. Nevertheless, in spite of the inadequacy of our real-life experiences of charity, we have in fact formed a more perfect conception of charity. For Plato, we need _standards_ before we can evaluate specific instances. We need to know what charity ideally is before we can evaluate alleged instances of it. This requires more reflection than observation, and perhaps even requires that we cast our vision away from this imperfect world toward a more perfect one. By proposing the theory of the Forms, Plato offers us a perfect world upon which we can contemplate. So, Plato’s hypothesis of the realm of the Forms is not as pointless as Aristotle charges.

**Mackie’s First Criticism: The Concept of the Forms Is Queer**

An especially articulate contemporary defender of moral relativism is Australian philosopher John L. Mackie (1917–1981), who argued that morality is something that we invent: “Morality is not to be discovered but to be made: we have to decide what moral views to adopt, what moral stands to take.” According to Mackie, a major problem with Plato’s account of moral objectivism is that there is something “queer,” or counterintuitive, about any description that we might give of the realm of the moral Forms:

This [argument from queerness] has two parts, one metaphysical, the other epistemological. If there were objective values, then they would be entities or qualities or relations of a very strange sort, utterly different from anything else in the universe. Correspondingly, if we were aware of them, it would have to be by some special faculty of moral perception or intuition, utterly different from our ordinary ways of knowing everything else. [_Ethics_, 1977]

             For Mackie, the _metaphysical_ problem with Plato’s theory of the Forms concerns its strange, spirit-like realm. Where is this realm? How many dimensions does it have? Mackie argues that the strangeness of this realm alone is a compelling argument against its existence. The _epistemological_ problem with Plato’s theory concerns how we gain knowledge of these spirit-like things. We gain knowledge of the physical world through our five senses. But by what faculty do we gain knowledge of this spirit-like realm? Plato says that it involves a faculty of recollection—similar to our memory faculty—that dredges up knowledge from past-life experiences. However, few of us would claim to have this type of recollective faculty. Even if we say that it is a type of rational faculty, this presumes that it is like a mental eyeball that peers into another realm. But we do not seem to have this kind of mental faculty either. The heart of the problem, for Mackie, is that it is not clear how the peculiar, non-natural realm of the Forms has any connection with natural objects and human actions; the two realms are too distinct.

             How might Plato respond to this charge? There is in fact a story about Plato where he addresses this type of criticism. Plato was once teaching his students about the Forms and using words like “tableness” and “cupness” to refer to them. A critic interrupted him and said, “I see a table and a cup, but I see no tableness or cupness.” Plato responded, “That is understandable since you have eyes by which you can contemplate a cup and a table, but you do not have intellect by which you can see tableness and cupness” (Diogenes Laertius, _Lives_). Plato’s point was that this particular critic stubbornly shut off his mental faculty that would have enabled him to see the Forms. In a sense, queerness is in the eye of the beholder, and if you blind yourself to the perception of something, the very mention of that thing will seem odd to you. People with artistic eyes perceive a beauty in the world that people without such eyes are incapable of grasping. Religious mystics around the world report direct experiences of a higher divine realm that non-mystics cannot understand. Trained scientists see a logic in the world around them in entirely different ways than non-scientists do. In Plato’s case, grasping the reality of the Forms is a matter of using the right faculty of mental perception.

             The problem of queerness that Mackie points out does pose a genuine challenge: just because Plato claims that we have eyes to perceive the Forms does not mean that we actually do have such eyes. The burden rests with Plato to convincingly show us what those eyes are and what they perceive. Mackie is not convinced, and maybe most people who consider the issue also will not be. But, there are many people even today who are convinced that there are eternal truths external to human society that can be grasped with the right kind of mental vision. Maybe these people are deluding themselves, and maybe we can justly be suspicious about their claims. But, to the extent that such claims parallel those of artists, mystics or trained scientists, it may be premature to outright dismiss them.

**Mackie’s Second Criticism: Tendencies to Objectify Can Be Psychologically Explained**

In a second criticism of Plato, Mackie offers a psychological explanation for why people erroneously believe that there are objective standards of any kind. According to Mackie, people naturally tend to objectify standards that are actually subjective in origin. For example, if I smell a rotten orange and it disgusts me, then I automatically think that the rotten orange itself is disgusting in nature. Clearly, though, the element of disgust is a subjective quality pertaining to my reaction; it is not really a feature of the orange itself. I erroneously project the quality of disgust onto the orange. One reason that we make this mistake is because _something_ is, in fact, external—namely, the orange itself. We then mistakenly think that _everything_ pertaining to the orange is also external.

             Mackie suggests that the same psychological projection takes place with moral standards. Society places external constraints on me to behave morally, such as society’s demand that I not run around naked. This societal demand itself is external to me; that is, I did not invent it myself. Since this societal demand is external, I then erroneously think that everything about the demand is external, including the moral standard in question, such as that it is wrong to run around naked in public. For Mackie the question comes to this: is it more reasonable to adopt Plato’s theory of external moral Forms, or, instead, this psychological projection theory. Mackie believes that the psychological projection theory wins out.

             Mackie’s argument strategy here is appropriate. That is, it is relevant to consider a psychological explanation for why we might hold to any erroneous view. For example, suppose that my neighbor wrongly believes that a hideous monster is stalking him. One way of exposing his error is to hire a surveillance team to continually watch him; presumably, they would not detect a monster. However, another way to expose his error is to offer a cogent explanation of why he is having these delusions. I might, for example, show that there is a history of schizophrenia in his family and that he is another unlucky victim. My neighbor himself may not be convinced by this; instead, he may think that I am plotting with the monster against him. However, to an impartial observer, this would be compelling evidence that my neighbor was in error about the monster. Similarly, a follower of Plato might not be persuaded by Mackie’s theory of psychological projection. But, to the extent that we can consider the issue impartially, Mackie’s theory of psychological projection is reasonable enough to make us think long and hard about why we might hold to a conception of objective moral Forms.

             Plato’s best response to Mackie would be to have us focus on the external character of mathematics. We could develop a psychological projection theory of this too. Society demands that we learn mathematics and use it in every day applications—from engineering to accounting. This societal demand is external to me, and I then think everything about this demand is external, including the nature of mathematics itself. But here the psychological projection theory seems wrong. I have good reason to believe that there really is something external about the nature of mathematics. People often refer to mathematics as the universal language since, regardless of where we are from, we rely on and understand the same basic mathematical notions. Not only do mathematical concepts cut across human cultures, but fans of science fiction believe that mathematics is the universal language of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. In fact, a research organization called the SETI Institute (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) attempts to eavesdrop on mathematically-based messages broadcast from outer space.

             Thus, Mackie’s psychological projection theory does not offer a compelling alternative to Plato’s theory of mathematical Forms. That is, in the absence of a better third alternative, it is more reasonable to adopt Plato’s theory than the projection theory. But that is with mathematical Forms; what about moral Forms? It all comes down to whether morality is universal in a manner similar to mathematics, and that brings us back to the earlier question of whether there are core standards to all societies. We’ve seen that societies hold a diversity of inconsistent views of killing, proper care of children, and being truthful. However, if amidst that diversity we can locate any common moral theme, no matter how general—such as “avoid harming others when possible”—then Plato’s theory might be more compelling than Mackie’s psychological projection theory.

**LINGERING PROBLEMS WITH MORAL RELATIVISM AND OBJECTIVISM**

So, where does this leave us regarding the contest between moral relativism and moral objectivism? The evidence seems to be weighted more in favor of moral relativism for the simple reason that moral diversity is what we see, and unchanging moral Forms is what we do not see. Still, we cannot declare moral relativism the clear victor. In a sense, we are trapped between the two views: experience of the world around us suggests that moral standards are created by human societies, yet we hope that there are some uniform moral standards that are fixed outside of ever-changing societies. Is there a way of bringing these two sides together? It would require concessions from both sides, and we will briefly consider some possible ones.

**Possible Concessions from Relativists**

One possible concession for relativists would be to acknowledge that, although many standards do vary from culture to culture, a large number might not be truly moral in nature and would be better classified as rules of etiquette. That is, they involve personal lifestyle choices that, in spite of their strangeness, do not warrant moral condemnation by anyone. Many of the culturally relative practices noted by Sextus Empiricus seem to fall into the etiquette category, including men wearing dresses:

No man here would dress himself in a flowered robe reaching to the feet, although this dress, which with us is thought shameful, is held to be highly respectable by the Persians. And when, at the court of Dionysis the tyrant of Sicily, a dress of this description was offered to the philosophers Plato and Aristippus, Plato sent it away with the words “I am a man and I could never put on a woman’s outfit.”.. . [_Outlines of Pyrrhonism_, 3.24]

The same goes for social customs that Montaigne and Sumner discuss, such as death rites, body art, dietary practices, religious rituals, gender roles, political institutions, and property ownership. While in each of these cases there are clear protocols that societies expect, society might not morally condemn people to stray from them.  Once we sift through all of the clashing standards worldwide and remove those that are mere etiquette, there may be only a minimal number of genuine moral standards that conflict with each other. This, then, might bring the relativists and objectivists a little closer together.

             The problem with this concession, though, is that it misses a critical point about cultural relativism: just because our culture thinks that it is a mere question of etiquette if a man wears women’s clothes, we cannot presume that it is mere etiquette in other cultures as well. For all we know, it was a grave moral offence in Plato’s culture for him to wear a dress, and not just a question of decorum. So too with burial practices and other social conventions. Thus, the best thing to do would be to assume that shocking social customs from a foreign society are moral standards _for that societies_, at least until we have evidence that the foreign society itself deems it as a mere standard of etiquette.

             Here’s a second possible concession that the relativists might make, which was suggested by Aquinas who was on the objectivist side of this debate. Maybe there are very general moral standards that are held world-wide, while the specific application of those principles might vary from culture to culture. Aquinas’s example is the general principle that “bad people should be punished,” where it is left to individual societies to determine how punishment should be carried out. As Aquinas states, “the general principles of the natural law cannot be applied to all men in the same way on account of the great variety of human affairs. Hence arises the diversity of positive laws among various people” (_Summa Theologica_, 1a2ae.95.2). So, by conceding the objectivist’s point that general moral principles are the same in all cultures, the relativist could still retain the position that the specific application of those principles is the prerogative of individual cultures, which may vary.

             This seems like a reasonable concession, but the devil is in the details about what counts as a general principle. Take, for example, the principle “don’t kill”, which Aquinas himself considers to be one such general principle. There are built in assumptions here, such as whether we are talking about killing humans as opposed to animals, which is a relevant concern for animal rights activists. There are also built-in exceptions, such as cases of war and self-defense, which is a relevant concern for pacifists. There are also the exceptions that we looked at earlier, such as cases of vigilante justice, honor killings, tribal feuds, and others. Cooperation between relativists and objectivists on these details would be challenging, and the proposal might not ever get out of the negotiating committee.

**Possible Concessions of Objectivists**

Consider next two concessions that objectivists might make to help bridge the gap with relativism. First, maybe objectivists can set aside notions of moral Forms or eternal moral truths, and instead accept that the idea that societies are capable of creating major moral principles in a consistent and uniform way. In this manner, the idea of uniform moral standards will make objectivists happy, while the idea of creation-by-society will make relativists happy. This would be a comparatively easy compromise for the relativist. The concept of cultural variation is important to relativism, but what is more important to them is the idea that societies create moral values. Even if all cultures throughout time consistently endorsed the moral standard that murder is wrong, relativists could still argue that this standard is grounded in social traditions, not in objective Forms. There may be common factors that prompt all societies to create and endorse similar standards, such as a prohibition against murder. But this does not make these standards any less social creations; moral standards would still be grounded in social approval.

             But this compromise would be much harder for objectivists to make. The idea of downplaying cultural variation is indeed appealing to objectivists, but what is more important to them is locating a source of morality outside of society. Societies are all unstable, and morality is too important to rest on such shaky foundations. Even if today’s societies have more or less developed a uniform set of moral standards, they might not all be the right standards. Some standards may be too lax, such as with sexual permissiveness, and others may be missing altogether, such as with religious virtues.

             A second possible compromise for objectivists is this. Maybe objectivists can move away from moral Forms or eternal moral truths, and instead accept that key standards of morality may be grounded in human biology. Moral relativists do not necessarily hold that moral standards are completely arbitrary creations of society. Some aspects of human nature might influence the kinds of customs that we approve of. Humans and animals alike are biologically programmed to find some things pleasing and other things painful. There are other possible factors embedded in human nature that might influence how we develop moral standards, such as are our natural inclinations of self-preservation, fear of death, living in peace, or improving our well-being as active social creatures. If there are any common core moral values, it is because humans share the same biological drives. This gives a foundation to morality that is outside mere human culture, and is an external force that shapes how societies develop their moral standards in a more or less uniform way.

             The idea of grounding morality in biology is not new, and objectivists like Aquinas took this approach. The problem for objectivists, though, is that standards grounded in mere biology would not be eternal and unchanging. They are the product of blind evolution and, in time, our social impulses may evolve in another direction. Biology is certainly more stable than social custom, but it is not as stable as moral Forms or eternal moral truths. For that reason, objectivists would insist that the social instincts of biology need to be grounded in a non-physical and unchanging realm, such as Plato’s Forms or God’s will. That is, there is first an eternal moral standard, then that standard is embedded by God or nature in human instinct, then humans articulate that standard in a moral code.

             All in all, it is unlikely that relativists and objectivists will compromise on the key points of their theories, and if there is any compromise it may only be that of acquiring an attitude of tolerance for the other side. Relativists will need to respect the hope held by objectivists that morality has a secure foundation that is not subject to change. Objectivists in turn will need to respect the relativist’s conviction that our experience confirms the variety of moral standards that society creates.

**Summary**

Protagoras articulated the view that “man is the measure of all things,” which is best interpreted as a statement of individual relativism—namely, that whatever a person may judge to be true is true for that person. Philosophers of the skeptical tradition, beginning with Pyrrho, developed the notion of cultural relativism and defended it by noting the broad diversity of moral standards. As such, they denied an objective foundation of morality. The principal argument for cultural relativism is based on cultural variation. That is, cultural relativism is a better explanation of differing moral standards than is moral objectivism. Against moral relativism, Plato argued that relativism is self-refuting. Balfour criticized moral relativism on the grounds that many accepted social practices are corrupt while true objective morality is intuitively clear. Rachels criticized moral relativism with the argument that some key moral standards are cross-cultural.

             Plato’s theory of moral objectivism is that moral truth is located in the spirit realm of the Forms. We gain moral knowledge through past-life recollection of the moral Forms, especially the Form of the Good. Aristotle criticized Plato for offering a theory that was unnecessarily complex. Mackie criticized Plato’s theory as “queer” with regard to the nature of the Forms and how we gain knowledge of the Forms. Mackie also offered a psychological projection theory that explains why philosophers such as Plato wrongly believe that moral standards are objective. We concluded by looking at possible compromises between moral relativism and moral objectivism. On the relativist’s side, maybe the relativist will concede that much of the variation within societies is with standards of etiquette, not standards of morality. Secondly, maybe relativists will concede that general moral principles are uniform while only their particular applications vary from culture to culture. On the objectivist’s side, maybe the objectivist will concede to the idea that societies are capable of creating key moral principles in a consistent and uniform manner. Secondly, maybe objectivists will concede that major standards of morality may be grounded in human biology.

**READING 1: SUMNER ON CULTURAL RELATIVISM**

 

**2. The folkways are a Societal Force**

The operation by which folkways [i.e., social traditions] are produced consists in the frequent repetition of petty acts, often by great numbers acting in concert or, at least, acting in the same way when face to face with the same need. The immediate motive is interest. It produces habit in the individual and custom in the group. It is, therefore, in the highest degree original and primitive. By habit and custom it exerts a strain on every individual within its range; therefore it rises to a societal force to which great classes of societal phenomena are due. …

**31. The Folkways are “Right”**

The folk­ways are the” right” ways to satisfy all interests, because they are traditional, and exist in fact. They extend over the whole of life. There is a right way to catch game, to win a wife, to make oneself appear, to cure disease, to honor ghosts, to treat com­rades or strangers, to behave when a child is born, on the war­path, in council, and so on in all cases which can arise. The ways are defined on the negative side, that is, by taboos. The “right” way is the way which the ancestors used and which has been handed down. The tradition is its own warrant. It is not held subject to verification by experience. The notion of right is in the folkways. It is not outside of them, of independent origin, and brought to them to test them. In the folkways, whatever is, is right. This is because they are traditional, and therefore con­tain in themselves the authority of the ancestral ghosts. When we come to the folkways we are at the end of our analysis. The notion of right and ought is the same in regard to all the folk­ways, but the degree of it varies with the importance of the interest at stake. The obligation of conformable and cooperative action is far greater under ghost fear and war than in other mat­ters, and the social sanctions are severer, because group interests are supposed to be at stake. Some usages contain only a slight element of right and ought. It may well be believed that notions of right and duty, and of social welfare, were first developed in con­nection with ghost fear and other-worldliness, and therefore that, in that field also, folkways were first raised to mores. “Right” are the rules of mutual give and take in the competition of life which are imposed on comrades in the in-group, in order that the peace may prevail there which is essential to the group strength. Therefore rights can never be “natural” or “God-given,” or absolute in any sense. The morality of a group at a time is the sum of the taboos and prescriptions in the folkways by which right conduct is defined. Therefore morals can never be intuitive. They are historical, institutional, and empirical.

             World philosophy, life policy, right, rights, and morality are all products of the folkways. They are reflections on, and general­izations from, the experience of pleasure aid pain which is won in efforts to carry on the struggle for existence under actual life conditions. The generalizations are very crude and vague in their germinal forms. They are all embodied in folklore, and all our philosophy and science have been developed out of them.

**34. Definition of the Mores**

When the elements of truth and right are developed into doctrines of welfare, the folkways are raised to another plane. They then become capable of producing inferences, developing into new forms, and extending their constructive influence over men and society. Then we call them the mores [i.e., values]. The mores are the folkways, including the philosoph­ical and ethical generalizations as to societal welfare which are suggested by them, and inherent in them, as they grow.

**65. What is Goodness or Badness of the Mores**

It is most important to notice that, for the people of a time and place, their own mores are always good, or rather that for them there can be no question of the goodness or badness of their mores. The reason is because the standards of good and right are in the mores. If the life conditions change, the traditional folkways may produce pain and loss, or fail to produce the same good as formerly. Then the loss of comfort and ease brings doubt into the judgment of welfare (causing doubt of the pleasure of the gods, or of war power, or of health), and thus disturbs the unconscious philosophy of the mores. Then a later time will pass judgment on the mores. Another society may also pass judgment on the mores. In our literary and historical study of the mores we want to get from them their educational value, which consists in the stimulus or warning as to what is, in its effects, societally good or bad. This may lead us to reject or neglect a phenomenon like infanticide, slavery, or witchcraft, as an old “abuse” and” evil,” or to pass by the crusades as a folly which cannot recur. Such a course would be a great error. Everything in the mores of a time and place must be regarded as justified with regard to that time and place. “Good” mores are those which are well adapted to the situation. “Bad” mores are those which are not so adapted.

**505. The Relation of the Social Codes to Philosophy and Religion**

Amongst the widest differences of opinion would be that on the question whether the social codes issue out of and are enthused by philosophy or religion. We are told [by Schultze-Gavernitz] that “for most men, actions stand in no necessary connection with any theoretical convictions of theirs, but are, on the contrary, independent of the same, and are dominated by inherited and acquired motives." Why is this not true? Also, [we are told by Schallmeyer that] "the antagonism between the principles of our religion and our actual behavior, even of the faithful, as well as the great difference in the ethical views of different peoples who profess the same religion, sufficiently proves that the motives of our acts, and our judgments on the acts of others, proceed primarily from practical life [i.e. from the cur­rent mores], and that what we believe has comparatively little influence on our acts and judgments." Religion and philosophy are components of the mores, but not by any means sources or regulators of them.

**READING 2: RASHDALL ON MORAL OBJECTIVISM**

**Objective Morality Exists Outside the Human Mind and the Material Realm**

We say that the Moral Law has a real existence, that there is such a thing as an absolute Morality, that there is something absolutely true or false in ethical judgements, whether we or any number of human beings at any given time actually think so or not. Such a belief is distinctly implied in what we mean by Morality. The idea of such an unconditional, objectively valid, Moral Law or ideal undoubtedly exists as a psychological fact. The question before us is whether it is capable of theoretical justification. We must then face the question _where_ such an ideal exists, and what manner of existence we are to attribute to it. Certainly it is to be found, wholly and completely, in no individual human consciousness. Men actually think differently about moral questions, and there is no empirical reason for supposing that they will ever do otherwise. Where then and how does the moral ideal really exist? As regards matters of fact or physical law, we have no difficulty in satisfying ourselves that there is an objective reality which is what it is irrespectively of our beliefs or disbeliefs about it. For the man who supposes that objective reality resides in the things themselves, our ideas about them are objectively true or false so far as they correspond or fail to correspond with this real and independent archetype, though he might be puzzled to give a metaphysical account of the nature of this “correspondence” between experience and a Reality whose _esse_ [i.e. being] is something other than to be experienced. In the physical region the existence of divergent ideas does not throw doubt upon the existence of a reality independent of our ideas. But in the case of moral ideals it is otherwise. On materialistic or naturalistic assumptions the moral ideal can hardly be regarded as a real thing. Nor could it well be regarded as a property of any real thing: it can be no more than an aspiration, a product of the imagination, which may be useful to stimulate effort in directions in which we happen to want to move, but which cannot compel respect when we feel no desire to act in conformity with it.

**Objective Morality Exists in the Mind of God**

An absolute Moral Law or moral ideal cannot exist in material things. And it does not (we have seen) exist in the mind of this or that individual. Only if we believe in the existence of a Mind for which the true moral ideal is already in some sense real, a Mind which is the source of whatever is true in our own moral judgements, can we rationally think of the moral ideal as no less real than the world itself. Only so can we believe in an absolute standard of right and wrong, which is as independent of this or that man's actual ideas and actual desires as the facts of material nature. The belief in God, though not (like the belief in a real and an active self) a postulate of there being any such thing as Morality at all, is the logical presupposition of an “objective” or absolute Morality. A moral ideal can exist nowhere and no how but in a mind; an absolute moral ideal can exist only in a Mind from which all Reality is derived. Our moral ideal can only claim objective validity in so far as it can rationally be regarded as the revelation of a moral ideal eternally existing in the mind of God.

             We may be able, perhaps, to give some meaning to Morality without the postulate of God, but not its true or full meaning. If the existence of God is not a postulate of all Morality, it is a postulate of a sound Morality; for it is essential to that belief which vaguely and implicitly underlies all moral beliefs, and which forms the very heart of Morality in its highest, more developed, more explicit forms. The truth that the moral ideal is what it is whether we like it or not is the most essential element in what the popular consciousness understands by “moral obligation”. Moral obligation means moral objectivity. That _at least_ seems to be implied in any legitimate use of the term: at least it implies the existence of an absolute, objective moral ideal. And such a belief we have seen imperatively to demand an explanation of the Universe which shall be idealistic or at least spiritualistic, which shall recognize the existence of a Mind whose thoughts are the standard of truth and falsehood alike in Morality and in respect of all other existence. In other words, objective Morality implies the belief in God. The belief in God, if not so obviously and primarily a postulate of Morality as the belief in a permanent spiritual and active self, is still a postulate of a Morality which shall be able fully to satisfy the demands of the moral consciousness. It may conveniently be called the secondary postulate of Morality.

**INTRODUCTION**

A driver’s education instructor became enraged when his car was cut off by another vehicle. He was teaching a female student driver at the time, and he told her to chase down the vehicle. They caught up to it, the instructor got out and walked over to the other driver, then punched him. The other driver quickly took off, and the instructor ordered the student to chase him again. He was charged with assault, suspended from his school job and he later resigned.

             Although this particular situation has an element of irony, many other stories of aggressive driving are nothing but tragic. On Virginia’s George Washington Parkway, two motorists confronted each other when changing lanes, and the dispute erupted in a high-speed battle. Both drivers lost control of their vehicles, crossed the centerline, and killed two innocent motorists. Studies by the American Automobile Association indicate that aggressive driving results in at least 1,500 deaths each year. Sometimes their cars get out of control, as in this situation, other times drivers intentionally use their vehicle as a weapon, and in still others they pull out a gun that they are carrying with them.

             The circumstances that spark aggressive driving are mostly trivial. A motorist might brake abruptly, swerve into another lane, or honk the horn. This prompts shouting, tailgating, obscene gestures, high-speed chases, and direct physical confrontations. There are psychological explanations for the aggressive driving phenomenon. Traffic is continually becoming heavier and thereby causing sensory overload. Many assailants are in large sports utility vehicles, which perhaps gives them a false sense of invulnerability. The root of the problem, however, is that the assailant experiences a strong emotion of anger and seemingly loses the ability to control it. Many relatively minor events in our daily lives have the potential to make us angry. The cat might knock over a plant, the new computer might malfunction, a store clerk might be rude, or the neighbors might be too noisy. We learn to combat our angry urges, though, and react in a civilized manner.

             Anger is just one strong feeling that we must keep in check. Others include lust, hunger, envy, malice, hatred, resentment, fear, pride, and desire. Imagine what life would be like if people never restrained _any_ of these emotions. We would constantly clash with others, and society as we know it would collapse. Controlling strong emotions is a matter of training. Our parents and teachers begin training us when we are young. As we get older, we continue the training process on our own. Eventually, we develop habits that become fixed character traits of our personality. In short, we acquire what moral philosophers call _virtues_—positive character traits that regulate emotions and urges. Typical virtues include courage, temperance, justice, prudence, fortitude, liberality, and truthfulness. Vices, by contrast, are negative character traits that we develop in response to the same emotions and urges. Typical vices include cowardice, insensibility, injustice, and vanity. As a fully developed moral theory, _virtue theory_ is the view that the foundation of morality is the development of good character traits, or virtues. A person is good if he or she has virtues and lacks vices.

**Early Greek View of Virtues**

Historically, virtue theory is one of the oldest moral theories in Western philosophy, having its roots in ancient Greek civilization. The Greek term for virtue is _arete_, which means “excellence.” Greek epic poets and playwrights, such as Homer and Sophocles, described the morality of their heroes and antiheroes in terms of their respective virtues and vices. Their characters’ successes and failures hinged on their virtuous or vicious character traits. For example, in Sophocles’ tragedy _Oedipus Rex_, King Oedipus’s life crumbles after he unknowingly kills his father and sleeps with his mother. These tragic acts themselves, though, are a consequence of his character flaws, particularly pride and overconfidence.

             Discussions of the virtues become more formalized in the writings of Plato, who stressed four particular virtues: temperance, courage, wisdom, and justice (_Republic_ 4.435). Later philosophers dubbed these the _cardinal virtues_, that is, main virtues, because of the central role they play in making us good people. According to Plato, each of these four virtues performs a special task. The virtue of temperance enables you to control your basic desires and natural impulses towards food, lust, and any other pleasurable drive that you might have. Courage helps define the nobler and heroic parts of you personality. You do not want to thoughtlessly rush into danger when you try to save the day, or be arrogant in how you deal with people less courageous than you are. Wisdom gives the rational part of your personality the capacity to make subtle judgment calls regarding the right way to live. The world is a complex and often confusing place, and wisdom enables you to navigate through your various choices. Finally justice helps you integrate all three aspects of your personality—the desiring part, the noble part, the rational part—so that each part performs exactly as it should in the right situation. For Plato, these four virtues are a package deal since they are so intertwined: if you have one you also have the others, and if you lack one you also lack the others (_Protagoras_, 349b).

             Even today Plato’s depiction of the four cardinal virtues is an inspiration for all who seek to better understand how virtuous character traits can morally transform their lives. But it is the virtue theory of his student Aristotle (384–322 BCE) that most influenced philosophy, and is the one that we will focus on in this chapter.

**ARISTOTLE’S THEORY**

Aristotle’s account of virtue is found in his work _The Nicomachean Ethics_, which he named in honor of his son Nicomachus. The work is long, at around 200 pages, and only the highlights of his theory can be presented here.

**Appetite-Regulating Habits**

There are three main components in Aristotle’s discussion of virtues. The first involves establishing the fact that we all strive after an ultimate good that defines who we are. For Aristotle, the subject of ethics is an attempt to discover this goal, and he argues that our ultimate good is happiness (in Greek, _eudaimonia__)_. But human happiness is different from the contentment that dogs experience, for example, and our happiness is unique to our specific human construction and purpose.

             The second component in Aristotle’s discussion involves discovering our uniquely human purpose by analyzing our uniquely human psyche. He offers this division of the human psyche:

                                                  Calculative (logic, math, science)

                         Rational <

             Psyche                         Appetitive (emotions, desires)

                         Irrational<

                                                  Nutritive (nutrition, growth)

According to Aristotle, the psyche has an irrational element that is similar to that found in animals and a rational element that is distinctly human. The highest aspect of the rational part is _calculative_ in nature and is responsible for the uniquely human ability to contemplate, reason logically, and formulate scientific principles. At the other extreme is the _nutritive_ faculty, the most primitive and irrational element of our psyche, which is responsible for our physical nutrition and growth. This element is present in all life forms, and not just in humans and other animals. Between the two extremes is an additional faculty that is by nature irrational but is guided by reason. This is the _appetitive_ faculty, which is responsible for our emotions and desires. The appetitive faculty is irrational since even lower animals experience desires. However, this faculty is rationally guided in humans since we have the distinct ability to control these desires with the help of reason. For example, animals have no capacity to control their anger while we do when we follow our reason. The human ability to properly control these desires is called “moral virtue” and is the focus of ethics.

             The third and final component in Aristotle’s discussion involves describing the moral virtues themselves. He makes three general observations about the nature of moral virtues. First, he argues that the ability to regulate our desires is not instinctive; rather, it is learned and is the outcome of both teaching and practice. Second, he suggests that desire-regulating virtues are character traits, or habitual dispositions, and should not be seen as either emotions or mental faculties. Third, he notes that moral virtues are desire-regulating character traits that fall at some mean between more extreme character traits. If we regulate our desires either too much or too little, then we create problems. For example, in response to our natural emotion of fear when facing danger, we should develop the virtuous character trait of courage. If we develop an excessive character trait by curbing fear too much, then we are said to be rash, which is a vice. If, on the other extreme, we develop a deficient character trait by curbing fear too little, then we are said to be cowardly, which is also a vice. The virtue of courage, then, lies at the mean between the excessive extreme of rashness and the deficient extreme of cowardice. Aristotle notes that this is similar to how “excess or deficiency of gymnastic exercise is harmful to strength.”

             According to the doctrine of the mean, most moral virtues, and not just courage, fall at the mean between two accompanying vices. He describes twelve virtues in particular that follow this model. Each virtue and vice arises in reaction to some specific appetite or desire we have. His analysis is summarized in this table:

**Desire                          || Vice of Deficiency | Virtuous Mean | Vice of Excess**

1. Fear of danger         **||** Cowardice                 Courage                       Rashness

2. Pleasure                   **||** Insensibility              Temperance                 Over-indulgence

3. Small giving            **||** Stinginess                  Generosity                   Extravagance

4. Great giving            **||** Pettiness                    Magnanimity               Vulgarity

5. Honors                     **||** Timidity                    Self-confidence           Conceit

6. Achievement           **||** Under-ambition        Proper ambition          Over-ambition

7. Anger                       **||** Impassivity              Good temper               Ill temper

8. Truth                        **||** False modesty          Truthfulness                Boastfulness

9. Amusement             **||** Humorlessness         Wittiness                     Buffoonery

10. Social life              **||** Unfriendliness          Friendliness                 Flattery

11. Fear of disgrace    || Shamelessness          Proper shame             Excessive shame

12. Resent injustice    || Malice                       Righteous indignation Envy

Of these twelve virtues, the pinnacle for Aristotle is self-confidence. It involves having a proper sense of importance about what we deserve and the honors that society makes available to us. For example, a self-confident person would not be cowardly when facing danger, or be insensible with pleasure, or be stingy about giving money.

             In his analysis of the virtues, Aristotle continually notes that there were not enough terms in his language to adequately name all the virtues and corresponding vices, and he had to make some up. This is also the case with the English language, and it may be difficult at first to grasp the relation between the various virtues and vices on the preceding chart. He also notes that not all virtues fall at a mean between two more extreme dispositions. One such virtue is that of justice, which simply has injustice as its contrary. The virtue of justice involves being lawful and fair; the unjust person, by contrast, is unlawful and unfair, and greedily grasps at things.

**Practical Wisdom**

Although Aristotle’s analysis of the twelve virtues fits into a nicely organized scheme, in real-life situations it can be difficult to pinpoint the mean between two extreme dispositions. Suppose I am a soldier, and I know in theory that if my fear gets the best of me I will be a coward, and if I completely ignore my fear I will be rash. Somewhere in the middle lies courage. But how many bullets need to zip past my head before I can courageously crawl back into my foxhole for safety? Or suppose I am a college student, and I understand that temperance involves knowing how to regulate my desire for pleasure. Am I insensible if I completely avoid going to fraternity parties? And if I do go, how many beers can I have before I am intemperate? Or suppose that, in my drive to succeed at my job, I understand that lack of ambition will get me fired but that too much ambition will destroy my home life. How much devotion should I show at my job?

             Aristotle confesses that it is indeed difficult to live the virtuous life primarily because of the challenges involved in finding the mean between the extremes. He argues that calculating the mean is not simply a matter of taking an average. For example, if drinking twenty beers at a party is too much and drinking no beers is too little, this does not imply that I should drink ten beers, which is the mathematical mean. Fortunately, there is a solution to this problem. Aristotle explains that an aspect of our calculative reasoning called practical wisdom (_phronesis_) helps us find the virtuous mean. There are two components to practical wisdom. First, it involves an intuitive knowledge of our ultimate purpose in life. In a nutshell, our ultimate purpose is to be community-oriented, rational creatures, and each properly formed virtue contributes to fulfilling this ultimate purpose. Second, practical wisdom involves deliberating about and planning the best way of attaining this ultimate purpose. As a soldier, cowering in my foxhole will not help me attain my community-oriented purpose; being too rash will not help me either. Practical wisdom will help me to assess the risks in different combat situations and to see when it would be most prudent for me to charge or to flee the enemy. Similarly, practical wisdom will help me figure out how many beers I should drink at a party and how much ambition I should have at my job. With each dilemma we face, then, our practical wisdom will help us home in on the appropriate conduct that will facilitate our ultimate purpose.

             In spite of the assistance that we receive from practical wisdom, we should not see it as an inner voice that tells us for each action whether that action hits the mean or one of the extremes. First, when we are in the process of developing virtuous habits, practical wisdom does not pronounce judgment on each of our actions. Instead, through our life experiences, we gradually develop a sense of our ultimate purpose, and just as gradually we cultivate virtuous habits. Second, once our virtuous habits are developed, we act spontaneously without step-by-step rational prompting. For example, once I learn how to be a safe driver, my roadway manners become second nature, and I slow down before approaching a stop sign without consciously thinking about it.

             If I successfully acquire virtues, then I attain the status of a good person. As a good person, each of my actions will reflect the virtuous character traits that I have developed. However, Aristotle argues, each of my actions must be freely chosen. That is, each action must have its causal origin within me; it cannot be imposed on me by other people. Further, for my choice to be truly free, I must know all of the important details pertaining to the action in question. He argues that freedom of the will is a factor with both virtuous choices and vicious choices.

**Good Temper**

In view of our opening discussion of aggressive driving, let’s look at Aristotle’s discussion of the virtue of good temper, the seventh virtue listed in our chart. Good temper properly restrains one’s appetite of anger. If I restrain my anger too much, I have the vice of impassivity; if I do not restrain it enough, I have the vice of ill temper. For Aristotle, there are five factors involved in our appropriate response to anger. We should become angry only (1) at the appropriate person, (2) for an appropriate offense, (3) to an appropriate degree, (4) with appropriate quickness, and (5) for an appropriate length of time. He warns that it is difficult to define precisely what counts as “appropriate” in these five circumstances. But he also maintains that good-tempered persons will not allow themselves to be ruled by their passions; instead, they will be guided by practical wisdom. Aristotle believes that it is appropriate to get angry when someone callously insults us. However, good-tempered individuals are not vengeful, and to a degree they accept their situation.

             As for the vice of impassivity, there are several reasons it is bad for us to completely lack expressions of anger. If we never react in anger even when there is proper cause, then it will appear to others that we will tolerate injustice. We will not defend ourselves, and that we will put up with insult after insult against our loved ones and ourselves. In a word, people will see us as fools. In spite of how bad it is to be completely unaffected by anger, Aristotle believes that it is better to err on the side of impassivity than on the side of ill temper since impassive people are easier to live with.

             At the other extreme, ill-tempered people express anger inappropriately with regard to at least one of the five factors given previously. In fact, Aristotle notes, we have different names for ill-tempered people based on the combination of factors in which they fail. “Hotheaded” people get angry too quickly, with the wrong people, for the wrong reason, and to the wrong degree (factors 1–4). However, they get over their anger quickly (factor 5), which is the best thing about hotheads. “Choleric” people get angry quickly at everything on every occasion (factors 1, 2, and 4). “Brooding” people fail mainly with the fifth factor, hanging on to their anger far too long. “Bad-tempered” people get angry at the wrong things for a long period of time (factors 2 and 5) and will not be satisfied until they inflict punishment on the offender. How would Aristotle view the person who exhibits aggressive driving? The enraged driver has perhaps picked out the appropriate person for an appropriate offense, and perhaps he is angry for an appropriate length of time. But the _degree_ of his reaction is far too extreme, and he becomes angry far too quickly. His principal failure, then, is with factors 3 and 4.

             To recap, these are the main points of Aristotle’s virtue theory:

• Moral virtues are habits that regulate the desires of our appetitive nature.

• Most virtues fall at a mean between two vicious habits.

• Our practical wisdom guides us in developing moral virtues by gradually informing us of our ultimate purpose and showing us the best means of attaining it.

• Our moral actions are freely chosen and are an extension of our virtuous habits.

Aristotle himself summarizes his notion of moral virtue in this way:

Virtues are means between extremes; they are states of character; by their own nature they tend to the doing of acts by which they are produced; they are in our power and voluntary; they act as prescribed by right reason. [_Nicomachean Ethics_, 3.5]

**Virtue Theory after Aristotle**

For 2000 years, Greek notions of virtue were central to Western conceptions of morality. The details were sometimes different, but moral philosophers consistently emphasized the need to acquire good character traits that guide our actions and thereby make us good people. We’ve already seen Plato’s account the four cardinal virtues of temperance, courage, wisdom, and justice. Immediately after Aristotle, the rival philosophical schools of Epicureanism and Stoicism offered competing views of morality and the virtues. Epicurus (341–270 BCE) identified the virtuous life with the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain. By contrast, Zeno of Citium (334–262 BCE), the founder of Stoicism, emphasized the importance of resigning ourselves to fate and suppressing our desires for things beyond our control. For Zeno, virtue is intimately connected with our knowledge of the physical world, and to this end, the virtuous person develops four knowledge-oriented virtues. Through intelligence, she knows what is good and bad. Through bravery, she knows what to fear and what not to fear. Through justice, she knows how to give what is deserved. And through self-control, she knows what passions to ignore.

             With the arrival of Christianity, the Apostle Paul endorsed the virtues of faith, hope, and charity, which were later dubbed the theological virtues—in contrast to Plato’s four cardinal virtues. Medieval philosophers sometimes referred to the “seven virtues,” combining the three theological virtues with the four cardinal virtues. Medieval philosophers, particularly Aquinas, held Aristotle in especially high regard and wrote commentaries on the _Nicomachean Ethics_, which helped perpetuate Aristotle’s analysis of the virtues. By the time of the Renaissance, philosophical discussions of virtue were mainly analyses of Aristotle’s theory.

**CRITICISMS OF VIRTUE THEORY**

In the seventeenth century, interest in Aristotle’s version of virtue ethics began to decline. His theory was not rejected outright; instead, leading moral philosophers argued that virtues were only of secondary importance in explaining moral obligation. Of primary importance was the need to follow rational moral rules and make sure that our actions abided by those rules. We will look at three historically important criticisms of his theory.

**Grotius’s Criticism: Many Virtues Are Not at a Mean**

In his work _The Law of War and Peace_ (1625), Dutch philosopher Hugo Grotius (1583–1645) began the attack on Aristotle by arguing that his theory fails as a systematic account of morality. Grotius focuses specifically on Aristotle’s doctrine of the mean. For Aristotle, virtues regulate our desires when we form middle-ground habits between more extreme habits. According to Grotius, some virtues do indeed control our passions through a middle course, but not all virtues do this. In fact, some virtues are actually extreme dispositions. For example, Aristotle lists insensibility—or contempt for pleasure—as a vice, but Grotius sees this as a virtue. Aristotle lists under-ambition—or contempt for great honors and achievement— as a vice, but Grotius also sees this as a virtue. In religious matters, Grotius believes that it is impossible to worship God too much, or to seek heaven too much, or to fear hell too much:

We cannot, for example, worship God too much; for superstition errs not by worshipping God too much, but by worshipping in a perverse way. Neither can we too much seek after the blessings that shall abide forever, nor fear too much the everlasting evils, nor have too great hatred for sin. [Prolegomena, 43–45]

 Thus, with religious devotion, the extreme is the virtue.

             The larger point, for Grotius, is that morality involves following the rational rules of natural law, and not hunting about for an elusive middle ground of behavior. Grotius believes that everyone has access to the moral rules of natural law, and our reason will quickly tell us when we should seek a middle ground and when we should do something in the extreme. At face value, his criticism seems plausible: we can understand how Aristotle might have forced a number of virtues into a mold that they did not quite fit. While some virtues, such as courage, do indeed lie at a mean between two extremes, that does not mean that all virtues do.

             However, in defense of Aristotle, if we carefully examine the specific cases that Grotius cites, Aristotle’s account of middle-ground virtues seems on target. Are contempt for pleasure and great honors really virtues as Grotius claims? For average people in average social situations, these extreme behaviors do indeed look like vices. By having contempt for all pleasure, we cut ourselves off from many of life’s best things, such as romance, good food, and entertainment. By having contempt for all great honors and achievement, we feel incomplete in what we try to accomplish in life. Grotius also believes that it is virtuous to be extreme in our worship of God, fear of hell, or desire for heaven. Similarly, though, for average people in average social situations, if we focus too much on religious matters, then we might neglect our earthly responsibilities. Even monks, who commit their lives to austerity and religious devotion, must find some middle-ground of moderation. If the monk goes too far he might starve himself to death, or whip himself to death, or pray to the point of insanity.

             So, contrary to Grotius, it seems correct for us to discover virtues through middle-ground dispositions—both for ordinary people and for monks. Many Eastern religions provide two separate lists of moral codes, one for monks and one for non-monks, and each of these codes is reasonable in its own context. The key issue, then, is identifying one’s social context and finding the appropriate middle-ground in that context.

**Kant’s Criticism: Without Moral Principles, Misapplied Virtues Become Vices**

German philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) recognized that virtues are important for developing our worth as people. However, he argues that virtues have no moral value unless they are directed by rational moral principles. In fact, for Kant, if our virtues are not guided by moral principles, then they actually become vices. For example, as Kant writes, “The coolness of a villain makes him not only much more dangerous but also immediately more abominable in our eyes than he would have been regarded by us without it” (_Foundations of the Metaphysics of Morals_). That is, we typically think that it is a virtue to be cool-headed; but when a villain is cool-headed, this actually makes him seem more evil than he would have been otherwise. Although Kant does not reject virtues, he believes that they are secondary to our need to follow moral principles. Our primary moral task, then, is to discover the rules of morality and only after that try to shape our character based on these rules.

             Philosophers before Kant also recognized that misapplied virtues become vices. One of the most dramatic illustrations of this is given by French statesman Maximilien de Bethune (1559–1641). He describes here an acquaintance of his who had an extraordinary number of virtues:

His genius was so lively that nothing could escape his penetration, his apprehension was so quick, that he understood everything in an instant, and his memory so prodigious, that he never forgot anything. He was master of all the branches of philosophy, the mathematics; particularly fortification and designing. Nay, he was so thoroughly acquainted with divinity, that he was an excellent preacher He applied this talent to imitate all sorts of persons, which he performed with wonderful dexterity; and was accordingly the best comedian in the world. He was a good poet, an excellent musician, and sung with equal art and sweetness. . . . His body was perfectly proportioned to his mind. He was well made, vigorous and agile, formed for all sorts of exercises. He rode a horse well, and was admired for dancing, leaping, and wrestling. He was acquainted with all kinds of sports and diversions, and could practice in most of the mechanical arts.

De Bethune then lists a series of horrible vices that this same acquaintance of his had:

Reverse the medal: He was a liar, false, treacherous, cruel, and cowardly, a sharper, drunkard and glutton. He was a gamester, an abandoned debauchee, a blasphemer and Atheist. In a word, he was possessed of every vice, contrary to nature, to honor, to religion, and society: he persisted in his vices to the last, and fell a sacrifice to his debaucheries, in the flower of his age; he died in a public stew, holding the glass in his hand, swearing, and denying God. [Quoted by James Balfour, _Delineation_ (1753), Ch. 5]

De Bethune’s point is that his acquaintance’s virtues became tainted by all of his vices. In sum, both de Bethune and Kant expose a central problem for virtue theory: Virtuous character traits by themselves are not necessarily good.

             But there is a solution to this problem. We need to start by distinguishing between two groups of character traits, the first being more important than the second:

• _Moral virtues_: benevolence, fidelity, integrity, justice, humanity, generosity

• _Intellectual abilities_: courage, coolness, industry, intelligence, wit, good manners, eloquence

According to virtue theorists, it is ethically more important for me to develop moral virtues, such as benevolence, than intellectual abilities, such as courage. In fact, my overall moral goodness depends on my developing moral virtues rather than intellectual abilities. So, if I first develop moral virtues, such as benevolence, then I will not be able to misapply intellectual abilities, such as courage. We can see this by returning to Kant’s example of the cool-headed villain. Kant’s villain lacks moral virtues but has the intellectual ability of coolness, which he misapplies. But suppose that the villain has a moral conversion and acquires moral virtues such as justice. As a morally virtuous person, he would not become a calm and calculating bank robber or hit man. Rather, as a just person, his coolness then becomes a moral asset rather than a moral liability, and it is difficult to imagine how a just person could ever misapply the intellectual virtue of coolness. The distinction between moral virtues and intellectual abilities also solves the puzzle raised by de Bethune’s example. The man’s “virtues” are really only intellectual qualities, and his “vices” are mostly genuine moral vices.

             In short, to solve the problem of misapplied virtues, we need to just recognize and adopt a superior class of truly moral virtues, and this will prevent us from misapplying our intellectual abilities.

**Mill’s Criticism: Morality Involves Judging Actions and Not Character Traits**

Like Kant, British philosopher John Stuart Mill (1806–1873) recognized the importance of virtues in forming our personal character. Good people, he says, are people who have virtues, such as charity. Mill also argues that virtues are important for influencing us to act properly. If I have the virtue of charity, then I will be more inclined to help others in need. Nevertheless, Mill argues, the job of morality is to assess people’s _actions_, and not their _character_:

No known ethical standard decides an action to be good or bad because it is done by a good or a bad man, still less because done by an amiable, a brave, or a benevolent man, or the contrary. These considerations are relevant, not to the estimation of actions, but of persons . . . [_Utilitarianism_, Ch. 2]

According to Mill, I am morally guilty only for what I _actually_ do, and not for what I am _inclined_ to do. Suppose, for example, that I dive into a river to rescue someone from drowning and that I’m motivated by the hope of getting a reward. Mill believes that I did the morally right thing. What matters is that I rescued that person; it does not matter what specifically inclined me to do it. So, since virtues are only inclinations, they are not relevant in our assessment of the actions themselves.

             Although we should disregard virtuous inclinations when making moral judgments, Mill is quick to point out that we must recognize the immediate _intention_ behind an action. The intention involves the action’s specific purpose. For example, when I dive into the river, my intention is to rescue you, not to drag you out of the river and torture you to death. My intention to rescue you will be the same regardless of whether I am predispositionally motivated by greed or benevolence. Thus, there three components to distinguish:

• _Action_: dive into the river and retrieve you

• _Intention_: rescue you from drowning

• _Predisposition_: financial greed

The predisposition constitutes the virtue or vice, and this is what Mill believes is unimportant when making moral judgments about a person. Mill recognizes that he might be going too far by devaluing the importance of virtues, but he believes that it is best to err on the side of caution and rigidly judge individuals for each of their intended actions.

             Mill is correct in pointing out that we often judge people’s intended actions, and not their predispositions. This is similar to how we legally judge criminals for the crimes that they actually commit, and not for their criminal predispositions. You may have a character flaw that predisposes you to steal, but the police cannot arrest you until you actually steal something. However, contrary to Mill, there are clear cases in which both moral and legal judgments go beyond the intended action and focus also on predispositions. There are repeat offenders who show a predisposition toward immoral or illegal actions, and we do hold that against them and punish them more harshly for that. Suppose that you are typically a mild-mannered person, but on one occasion you get into a bar fight and break a guy’s nose. This is certainly bad, but not as bad as if you were predisposed to violence—and especially if you displayed this predisposition by routinely getting into bar fights. Sometimes, we carry our moral track record around with us, and we expect that people will judge our actions based on the kind of person we’ve become.

             The upshot of the situation is that moral judgments are more multifaceted than Mill allows, and we often look beyond the intended action to the actual virtue or vice.

**VIRTUES, GENDER AND RULES**

Continuing the trend set by Grotius, Kant, and Mill, moral philosophers during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries typically assigned virtues a secondary place within their theories. All of these philosophers shared the conviction that morality is first and foremost a matter of following moral rules, and virtues only serve a secondary purpose of reinforcing those rules within us. However, in recent decades several moral philosophers have argued that theories of virtue deserve better than this secondary status. It started when British philosopher Elizabeth Anscombe (1919–2001) published an influential article entitled “Modern Moral Philosophy” (1958) in which she harshly criticized the direction of moral philosophy since the days of Grotius. According to Anscombe, modern moral theories inconsistently advance moral rules without any notion of a rule giver. With moral philosophers like Kant, it’s as though moral rules magically appear without convincing explanation what created and authorized them. She recommends that we abandon the entire rule-based approach in favor of the virtue-based approach offered by Aristotle, which avoids the whole question of moral rules.

             Anscombe and other critics after her suggest that there are essentially two approaches to morality: rule-based theories and virtue-based theories and. According to rule-based theories, (1) primary emphasis is placed on following moral rules, rather than developing good character traits; (2) good actions are those that comply with moral rules; and (3) moral judgments are based on the rightness of people’s actions, not on whether someone is a good person with virtuous character traits. By contrast, according to virtue-based theories, (1) greater importance is placed on developing good character traits than on acting in accordance with moral rules; (2) good actions are those that flow from our virtuous character traits; and (3) morality is a matter of being a _good person_, which involves having virtuous character traits. In this section we will look at the conflict between rule- based and virtue-based theories.

**Gender and Morality**

Virtue-based theories have received a boost recently from philosophers who argue that gender plays a large role in how we conceive of morality. Generally speaking, they maintain, rule-based morality is guided by male ways of thinking, whereas virtue theory is more akin to female ways of thinking. The main presumption here is that men and women psychologically differ from each other, and this impacts how each gender views moral obligations. On this view, men have a tendency to organize, pigeonhole, and make rules about things. Take, for example, the kinds of majors in college that are male dominated, such as mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer science. What they have in common is an emphasis on rigid rules. Women, by contrast, have traditionally played a nurturing role, raising children, tending to elderly parents, and overseeing domestic life. Think about college majors that are female dominated: education, nursing, psychology, social work. These tasks require less rule-following and more spontaneous and creative interaction.

             Whether this psychological distinction between men and women is the result of natural instinct or social condition is not entirely clear, since the scientific evidence surrounding the whole question is sketchy. Some of it may be instinctive. An explanation offered by one psychologist is that male and female mental abilities are the same, whether it involves doing math or raising children. It is just the men typically prefer more analytic tasks, and women prefer the more nurturing ones. But some of the gender differences may also be socially imposed. For example, the male emphasis on rule following may also have resulted from practices that were traditionally male-dominated, such as acquiring property, engaging in business contracts, and governing societies. In male-dominated societies, women may have been assigned more subservient domestic roles.

             Whether it is by instinct or social conditioning, though, defenders of this view have argued that the fundamental psychological difference between men and women has led to two different ways of looking at morality. The male emphasis on rule-following has set a pattern for creating rigid systems of moral rules, such as lists of moral rights and duties. The female emphasis on nurturing, by contrast, implies a moral need to care for people who are in situations of vulnerability and dependency. This position is often called _care ethics_, and Carol Gilligan (b. 1936), a leading proponent, depicts it this way:

The moral imperative that emerges repeatedly in interviews [on the subject of morality] with women is an injunction to care, a responsibility to discern and alleviate the "real and recognizable trouble" of this world. For men, the moral imperative appears rather as an injunction to respect the rights of others and thus to protect from interference the rights to life and self-fulfillment. [_In a Different Voice_, 1982, Ch. 3

According to Gilligan, it is the infusion of personal feeling into moral judgments that allows women to conceive of morality as compassion and care, rather than more abstract ethical principles.

             Of all the traditional approaches to morality, virtue theory is the one that accommodates care ethics the best. Caring for others is not about following moral rules, but about the nurturing character traits that we acquire. It is about a predisposition to behave in a caring way when we encounter vulnerable and dependent people who need help. It is about our ability to quickly respond in a caring way to the specific needs of these people. While Gilligan herself did not explicitly connect care ethics with virtue theory, a flood of philosophers inspired by her have done just that. The concept of care ethics is now intertwined with contemporary virtue theory, and the popularity of care ethics in this context has helped revive traditional virtue theory.

             How might the virtue of care fit into Aristotle’s theory of virtue? Much about his overall view of virtue would need serious updating. His list of specific virtues comes mainly from an elite social class of rulers, military leaders, landowners, and merchants. And these were social roles filled principally by wealthy men. Aristotle still believed that all people need to acquire moral virtues, whether they are men, women, or even slaves. However, the virtues of women and slaves, he argued, are different and reflect their more subservient roles in society. Women are to have the virtues of obedience, silence, and domestic upkeep. Aristotle insisted that women were not slaves, but he held that, in the natural order of things, women were subordinate to men, and women’s virtues reflect that social standing (_Politics_ 1.12-13 and 3.4). He would probably even agree that care is an important moral virtue for women, but would argue that it is nonetheless a virtue of a subservient class.

             Fortunately, we now live in a time that respects social equality, and each of Aristotle’s 12 virtues needs to be reinterpreted to apply to all social classes, including the wealthy, middleclass and the poor. Generosity is not just a virtue that wealthy people need to acquire. Even the poor should be generous, if not with their money, then at least with their time. When adding new virtues to his list, such as care, they also need to address the full spectrum of today’s social classes. The virtue of care could not simply be another of Aristotle’s subservient female virtues. It must be relevant to everyone, men and women alike. Even if women are naturally more interested in nurturing than men, that makes no difference. All moral virtues present challenges to our natural inclinations. We are naturally selfish people, but we need to rise above that when developing the virtue of charity. So too with anyone—male or female—who is not naturally nurturing. They need to overcome that limitation and meet the moral challenge of habitually caring for others.

**Virtues With or Without Rules?**

Anscombe and defenders of care ethics are good examples of the many contemporary philosophers who believe that virtues play a central role in morality. Often these writers appear to be saying that morality should be _completely_ independent of moral rules and grounded only in virtues. That is, morality is founded entirely on virtuous character traits such as courage and care, and these virtues are independent of all abstract moral principles. This is a rather extreme position and, for clarity, we will call this _strong_ virtue theory. A more moderate position, which we will call _weak_ virtue theory, is that virtuous character traits are inseparably connected with either a single rule or a core set of rules. For example, there is a general moral rule that people should be courageous, and the virtue of courage is the character trait that enables people to consistently act morally. Which of these two views is the more plausible account of the role that virtues play in morality?

             Some of the appeal of strong virtue theory undoubtedly stems from a frustration with the inadequacies of rule-based approaches to morality, such as those proposed by Kant and Mill. As Gilligan suggests, rigid rules seem so contrary to the nurturing dispositions needed for genuine morality that we should simply reject them. However, if we examine the views of traditional virtue theorists from Aristotle onwards, we will find that they hold to a position that is more like weak virtue theory, not the strong version. Within Aristotle himself there are three ways that virtues are connected with rules. First, Aristotle’s doctrine of the mean is itself a general principle, and many writers refer to it specifically as Aristotle’s “principle of the golden mean.” According to this principle, right or virtuous actions are those that fall between extreme responses. This rule is somewhat flexible and depends on our specific circumstances and the guidance of practical wisdom. Nevertheless, it is still the standard in determining virtuous conduct.

             Second, for Aristotle, each specific virtue is a standard by which we assess the correctness of our own actions, as well as those of other people. The virtue itself functions as a rule. This is clear in his discussion of the virtue of good temper noted previously. We praise people who abide by the virtuous mean of good temper and condemn those who do not. He also advises us as individuals to “cling to the middle state” of good temper so that we become praiseworthy. Similarly, the virtues of courage, temperance, generosity, and self-respect all become standards by which we praise or condemn actions. Standards like these are essentially rules for making moral judgments. Third, Aristotle’s virtue theory involves an intimate connection between ethics and politics. Ethics involves the discovery of our ultimate human purpose as developed in virtuous character traits. Politics extends directly from this and involves legislating “what we are to do and what we are to abstain from” (_Nicomachean Ethics_, 1.2). This process involves establishing just actions and just punishments (_Politics_, 7.13). Thus, governments create laws, which are legally binding rules of conduct and are standards for how we should behave within society. Virtues, then, are only the starting point; the next step is to create governing bodies, social classes, and the obligations of both rulers and citizens, all of which is rule-oriented.

             We also find a marriage between virtues and rules in medieval virtue theories. A case in point is the notion of the Seven Deadly Sins of lust, gluttony, greed, sloth, wrath, envy, and pride. Also known as the Capital Vices, these are especially bad character traits that give rise to condemnable actions. In the words of Thomas Aquinas, _these vices result in “the commission of many sins all of which are said to originate in that vice as their chief source”_ (_Summa Theologica__, 2-2:153:4)._ The vices prompt sinful conduct, and the sinful conduct breaks divinely mandated moral rules. Standing in contrast to each of the Seven Deadly Sins are the Seven Holy Virtues of chastity, temperance, charity, diligence, patience, kindness, and humility. These are virtuous character traits that block the commission of sinful action. Thus, the virtues, their corresponding vices, the sinful actions, and the divinely mandated moral rules are all parts of the same package.

             Of course, even if Aristotle and other philosophers from the past were weak virtue theorists, this does not prevent contemporary philosophers from adopting strong virtue theory. However, it does isolate the strong virtue theorist for proposing a radically new type of virtue theory that rejects both traditional rule-based morality and more moderate virtue-based morality. We would need a very compelling reason to depart so thoroughly from traditional notions of ethical rules and, so far, such an argument has not emerged. It is the weak theory of virtue that fits with tradition; at the same time, it accommodates important contemporary insights such as care ethics.

**Criticisms of Strong Virtue Theory**

In spite of the strong support for virtue-based morality, defenders of rule-based approaches often raise objections to virtue theory. However, most of these are attacks on strong virtue theory. Because of the popularity of such criticisms, it is important to see how defenders of weak virtue theory quickly respond to these charges. First, critics charge that there is a problem with determining precisely who is virtuous. It does not help to look for some external criterion, such as visible indications in the person’s action, since outward actions are no guarantee that the person’s inner self is virtuous. It also does not help to look for some internal criterion, such as the individual’s self-respect or integrity, since we do not have the ability to read people’s minds. In response, weak virtue theorists say that we look at people’s actions as indicators of their character traits—for example, whether a given action appears ill-tempered. We then praise or blame the action based on whether it approaches the virtuous mean.

             Second, critics argue that some acts, such as murder, are so intolerable that we must devise a special list of prohibited offenses. Strong virtue theory does not provide such a list, but it is easy for the weak virtue theorist to construct a list of prohibited actions. When we assess how well a person’s actions conform to the virtuous mean, it becomes evident that some actions are more blameworthy than others are. We then make a list of these actions. Although Aristotle did not provide a definitive list, he does note that certain vices are worse than others. For example, in his discussion of good temper, he argues that the vice of ill temper is worse than the vice of impassivity. Also, other virtue theorists do provide short lists of prohibited actions that stem from serious vices, such as the Seven Deadly Sins.

             Finally, critics argue that virtue theory permits us to occasionally act badly, as long as the virtue in question remains intact. For example, virtue theory emphasizes long-term character traits, such as honesty or generosity. Because of this long-term emphasis, we might overlook specific lies or acts of selfishness on the grounds that they are only temporary departures from our overall dispositions. The weak virtue theorist has two responses to this charge. First, once we set virtues up as standards of praise and blame, we are in a position to judge every action that departs from a given virtuous standard. The occasional lie, for example, will stand out and call for judgment. Second, it may be a mistake to think that occasional departures, such as white lies, do not compromise virtuous character traits. With many virtues, to be virtuous means to always display exemplary conduct. For example, even a single act of marital infidelity sufficiently signals a lack of virtue. A politician who publicly lies even once loses the trust of the people. It may sometimes seem as though we can still be virtuous while occasionally acting non-virtuously, but this may only mean that we have compromised our standards of morality.

**LINGERING PROBLEMS WITH VIRTUE THEORY**

Virtues play a role in most traditional moral theories, and even Grotius, Kant, and Mill do not suggest that we should completely abandon interest in them. The issue becomes, first, how prominent a role virtues should play in a theory, and, second, what specific virtues we should adopt.

**Incorporating Virtue Theory into Other Moral Theories**

Regarding the first issue—how prominent a role virtues should play—our discussion so far suggests that they certainly deserve a central role, but not the only role. First, even the simple task of listing various virtues involves at least some rules. To determine whether a specific character trait is virtuous as opposed to vicious, we will likely fall back on some rule, such as the principle of the golden mean. We are also likely to see each specific virtue itself as a standard and rule that indicates proper conduct. So, at a minimum, we should prefer weak virtue theory to strong virtue theory. Second, moral judgments are quite varied, and even weak virtue theory cannot adequately explain this diversity without bringing in other theories. Suppose that, when driving down the highway, I accidentally cut off another driver, who then flies into a rage and runs me into a ditch. Aristotle would say that the other driver was immoral largely because he had the vice of ill temper. This, though, is only one kind of moral assessment, and it is not even the most natural assessment that we might make. Instead, I might say that the driver was immoral because he caused me emotional pain for no justifiable reason. I might also say that the driver violated my rights—specifically, my right not to be physically attacked. If I am religious, I might say that the man sinned by going against God’s will.

             Contemporary virtue theorist Alasdair Maclntyre would say that I’m uttering nonsense with these other moral assessments—regardless of how commonly we speak about personal happiness, individual rights, or the will of God. Maclntyre believes that today we have only fragments of conflicting moral traditions:

We continue to use many of the key expressions [of morality]. But we have— very largely, if not entirely—lost our comprehension, both theoretical and practical, of morality. [_After Virtue_, 1984, Ch. 1]

To make sense of morality, says Maclntyre, we need to adopt Aristotle’s view of virtues. Contrary to Maclntyre, though, it is not reasonable to simply dismiss most of our moral vocabulary simply because it does not draw on virtue theory. More importantly, it is not even possible for us today to abandon these other moral notions in exclusive favor of virtue theory. Notions of moral rights are firmly imbedded into American moral consciousness, particularly the natural rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness as endorsed by the Declaration of Independence. Religious believers who ground morality in God’s will are not likely to shift to Aristotle’s virtue theory anytime soon. To best understand and theorize about morality, we should begin by acknowledging the wide range of approaches that people actually do take to the subject. Virtue theory is only one of many approaches.

             Regarding the second issue of specific virtues we should focus on, Aristotle’s short list of virtues is clearly incomplete. Whereas Aristotle stopped at a dozen virtues, seventeenth- and eighteenth-century virtue theorists expanded the list to include as many as 100 distinct virtues. Today, we should modify the list even more. Defenders of care ethics point out that Aristotle’s list reflects an aristocratic bias that we should reject, and they observe that we should include more feminine and nurturing qualities. As social trends shift and we become more receptive to racial, ethnic, and gender diversity, we should adopt virtues of social tolerance and acceptance. With growing interest in animal rights and environmental issues, we should cultivate virtues that display a sensitivity to these concerns. Part of the task of moral philosophers is to sift through social trends and update moral theories in this way.

**The Best Teacher of Morality**

Although we want to view virtue theory as only one of many approaches to morality, we should keep in mind virtue theory’s unique asset. Imagine that, as a parent, you want to teach your child that it is wrong to become inappropriately enraged. When your child is older, you do not want him to give in to aggressive driving, beat his wife, or perform any other action that is the consequence of inappropriate anger. Imagine further that you have two teaching methods available. The first method established meticulous rules for what counts as inappropriate anger in virtually every circumstance. It also included rules describing the kinds of punishments that are justified for each type of violation. According to this first teaching method, your child memorizes all these rules so that, for each situation that arises, your child immediately knows the right thing to do. The second method does not involve memorizing specific rules but instead focuses on instilling good habits. Using various techniques, such as behavior modification, you teach your child to avoid inappropriate expressions of anger and become habituated toward a more appropriate response. You also give him techniques so he can properly modify his angry behavior on his own, without your constant monitoring. All other factors being equal, which of these two methods would work best in preventing inappropriate anger? The habit-instilling method appears to be the winner.

             Virtue theorists capitalize on the benefits of teaching morality through creating virtuous habits. They argue that the most important thing about studying ethics is its impact on conduct. Aristotle himself said that he wrote the Nicomachean Ethics “not in order to know what virtue is, but in order to become good.” Detailed lists of rules in and of themselves do not make us better people, but instilling good habits does. American philosopher William James stated that “All our life. . . . is but a mass of habits,—practical, emotional, and intellectual”. Our minds, he argues, adapt to repetitive behavior, “just as a sheet of paper or a coat, once creased or folded, tends to fall forever afterward into the same identical folds.” Habits do not become merely second nature to us, but “ten times nature” because of how firmly they become rooted in us. Focusing on habits is the best way to teach morality to the young, and it is through the continual practice of good habits that they become moral saints. James writes, “Could the young but realize how soon they will become mere walking bundles of habits, they would give more heed to their conduct while in the plastic state” (“The Laws of Habit”, 1899).

             In our actual lives as we raise our children, we will likely adopt a hybrid approach moral instruction that involves both teaching rules and instilling good habits. The fact remains, though, that it is a mistake to completely ignore the benefits of virtue theory in moral instruction. Society needs all the help it can get in improving its moral climate. To that end, moral philosophers of all traditions should welcome the contributions of virtue theory.

**Summary**

Aristotle offered the view that morality consists of developing virtuous habits that regulate the desires of our appetitive nature. Most virtues are at a mean between two vicious habits and our practical wisdom guides us in developing moral virtues by gradually informing us of our ultimate function and showing us the best means of attaining it. Philosophers during the Middle Ages adopted Aristotle’s view, although virtues were reduced to a secondary status by seventeenth- and eighteenth-century moral philosophers. Grotius argued that Aristotle’s doctrine of the mean fails since some virtues, such as religious worship, actually require extreme behavior. Kant criticized that some virtues—such as cool-headedness— might become vices if they are not guided by higher moral principles. Mill argued that morality involves judging a person’s _actions_ and not a person’s _character_.

             Contemporary discussions of virtue assess the relative merits of virtue-based versus rule-based morality. Care ethics, which emphasizes the female capacity of nurturing, tells us that there is a moral need to care for people who are in situations of vulnerability and dependency. Many defenders reject the rule-based approach to ethics and that virtue theory is the best way of understanding the moral capacity to care. We can distinguish between strong virtue theory, which rejects all rules, and weak virtue theory, which involves some rules. Aristotle himself is a weak virtue theorist, and weak virtue theory sidesteps many common criticisms against virtue theory in general. In any case, virtue theory is only one of many approaches to moral philosophy, although virtue theory is uniquely suited for teaching morality.

**READING 1: ARISTOTLE ON TEMPERANCE AND OVER-INDULGENCE**

_Introduction: Aristotle holds that virtues occupy a middle ground between vices of excess and deficiency. Regarding our desire for pleasures such as food and sexual activity, the virtue of temperance lies at a middle ground between over-indulgence (the vice of excess) and insensibility (vice of deficiency). The following is Aristotle’s discussion of temperance and over-indulgence from his book Nicomachean Ethics._

**Over-Indulgence and Bodily Pleasures**

We will now consider temperance, for it seems that courage and temperance are the virtues of the irrational parts of human nature. 

             We have already said that temperance is a mean or middle state regarding pleasures (for it is not in the same degree or manner concerned with pains). Pleasure is also the sphere in which over-indulgence displays itself.

             Let us therefore now define the character of these pleasures. We will accept the distinction which is commonly made between bodily and mental pleasures such as ambition and the love of learning. For he who is ambitious or fond of learning takes pleasure in the object of which he is fond, although it is not his body which is affected but his mind. But where pleasures of this kind are in question people are not called either temperate or over-indulgent. It is the same with all such other pleasures as are not bodily. Thus, we call people “gossips” who are fond of talking and of telling stories, and who spend their days in trivial activities, but we do not call them over-indulgent, nor do we call people over-indulgent who feel pain at the loss of money or friends.

             Temperance then will apply to only bodily pleasures, but not even to all of these. For if people take pleasure in gratifications of vision, for example in colors, forms, and painting, they are not called either temperate or over-indulgent. Yet it would seem possible to take a proper pleasure or an excessive or insufficient pleasure in these things as well as in others. It is the same with gratifications of hearing. Nobody speaks of such people as taking an excessive pleasure in music or acting over-indulgently, or of people who take a proper pleasure as acting temperately. Nor again do we speak of people who enjoy gratifications of the smell as over-indulgent or temperate, except accidentally. For example, we do not call people over-indulgent if they take pleasure in the smell of apples or roses or incense, but rather if they take pleasure in the smell of sauces and relishes. For an over-indulgent person takes pleasure in these since they remind him of the objects of his desire. It is true that we may see other people, when they are hungry, taking pleasure in the smell of food. But it is only an over-indulgent person who habitually takes pleasure in these things, as they are the objects of his desire.

             Again, the lower animals in general are not capable of the pleasures of these senses, except accidentally. Dogs, for example, do not take pleasure in smelling rabbit’s flesh but only in eating it, although the smell gives them the sensation of eating. Also, a lion does not take pleasure in hearing an ox's lowing, but in devouring the ox, although, as it is the lowing by which he perceived that the ox is near, he appears to take pleasure in the lowing. Similarly, it is not the sight or discovery of a deer or wild goat that gives him pleasure, but the prospect of a meal.

**Over-Indulgence and the Sense of Touch**

Temperance and over-indulgence, then, concern pleasures of such a kind as the lower animals generally are capable of. Accordingly, these pleasures appear slavish and animalistic. They are the pleasures of touch and taste. It appears that the taste comes little, if at all, into question. For, it is the taste which judges flavors, as when people test wines or season dishes, but it is in no sense this judgment of flavors which gives pleasure, at least to such people as are over-indulgent, but rather the actual enjoyment of them, and the medium of enjoyment is invariably the sense of touch, whether in food, drink or sexual activity. This was the reason why a certain gluttonous connoisseur prayed that his throat might become longer than a crane's, showing that his pleasure was derived from the sense of touch. Thus, the sensory faculty with which over-indulgence is connected is the most universal of the senses. It would seem too that over-indulgence is justly criticized, since it is a characteristic of our animal nature, and not of our human nature. Thus, it is animalistic to take delight and great satisfaction in such things.  For the most respectable of the pleasures arising from touch have been set aside, such as those which occur during gymnastic training from the rubbing and the warm bath. For, for the contact that is characteristic of the over-indulgent man does not affect the whole body but only particular parts of it.

**Over-Indulgence and Natural Desires**

It seems that some desires are universal and others are individual and acquired. Thus, the desire of food is a natural desire. Everybody who feels also desires food or drink or perhaps both. Also, Homer says, a young man in the prime of life desires the love of a woman. But it is not equally true that everybody desires a particular form of gratification, or the same forms. Hence particular desires are unique to ourselves and individual. Nevertheless, there is something natural in it; for although different people are pleased by different things, yet there are some things which are more pleasant to all people than others.

             Now with natural desires, there are only a few people who make a mistake, and their mistake is always on one side, namely, that of excess. For to eat or drink anything to the point of excess is to exceed the natural limit of quantity, since the natural desire does not go beyond the satisfaction of our desire. Accordingly, such persons are called gluttons because they go beyond what is right in satisfying their desire. It is only excessively slavish people who behave in this way.

             Regarding such pleasures as are individual, there are many people who go wrong, and they go wrong in many different ways. For if people are said to be excessively fond of particular things, either as taking pleasure in wrong things or as taking more pleasure than ordinary people or as taking pleasure in a wrong way, the excess of which the over-indulgent are guilty may assume all these forms. For they take pleasure in some things which are detestable and therefore wrong. If these are things in which it is right to take pleasure, then they take a greater pleasure in them than is right or than most people take.

**Over-Indulgence and Pain**

It is clear then that excess regarding pleasures is over-indulgence, and that it properly is a subject of criticism. But with pains, there is this difference between temperance and courage. A person is not called temperate if he bears pains bravely, and over-indulgent if he does not. But a person is called over-indulgent because he feels more pain than is right at not obtaining pleasures, his pleasure being the cause of his pain, and the temperate man is so called because he is not pained at the absence of pleasure and at his abstinence from it. The over-indulgent man then desires all pleasures, or the greatest pleasures, and is led by his desire to prefer these to anything else. He thus feels a double pain, namely, the pain of failing to obtain them and the pain of desiring them, since all desire is attended by pain. Yet it seems paradoxical to assert that his pleasure is the cause of his pain.

**No Human is Deficient in Desire for Pleasure**

We never find people whose love of pleasures is deficient and whose delight in them is less than it ought to be. Such insensibility to pleasures is not human. For even the lower animals distinguish different kinds of food, liking some and disliking others. A being who should not take pleasure in anything, nor make any difference between one thing and another, would be far from being human. But there is no name for such a being, since he never exists.

             The temperate man holds a mean position regarding pleasures. He takes no pleasure in the things in which the over-indulgent man takes most pleasure; instead, he dislikes them. Nor does he take pleasure at all in wrong things, nor an excessive pleasure in anything that is pleasant, nor is he pained at the absence of such things, nor does he desire them, except perhaps in moderation, nor does he desire them more than is right, or at the wrong time, and so on. But he will be eager in a moderate and right spirit for all such things as are pleasant and at the same time conducive to health or to a sound bodily condition, and for all other pleasures, so long as they are not prejudicial to these or inconsistent with proper conduct or extravagant beyond his means. For, unless a person limits himself in this way, he pursues such pleasures more than is proper, whereas the temperate man follows the guidance of right reason.

**Over-Indulgence and Voluntary Choice**

Over-indulgence seems to be more the character of a voluntary action than with cowardice since over-indulgence is due to pleasure, and the cowardice to pain. Also, pleasure is something that we choose, whereas pain is something that we avoid. Further, while pain distracts and destroys the nature of one who suffers it, pleasure has no such effect, but rather leaves the will free. Hence over-indulgence deserves more severe criticism than cowardice; for it is easier to train oneself to meet its temptations as they frequently occur in life, nor does the training involve any danger, whereas the contrary is the case with cowardice and facing fearful situations.

             It would also seem cowardice as a general moral state is more voluntary than particular acts of cowardice. For general cowardice in itself is painless, but particular acts of cowardice occur because people are so utterly driven out of their minds by pain that they throw away their weapons and disgrace themselves. This is the reason why such acts have the appearance of being compulsory. On the other hand, with the over-indulgent person the particular acts are voluntary since he eagerly desires them. However, over-indulgence as a whole is not so voluntary, since nobody desires to be over-indulgent.

**Adult Over-Indulgence and Child Over-Indulgence**

We apply the term "over-indulgence" to the faults of children as well as to those of grownups, since there is a certain similarity between them. It does not matter to my present purpose which of the two kinds of faults is named after the other; but it is clear that grownup over-indulgence is named after the earlier child over-indulgence.

             The metaphor (in the word “over-indulgent”) seems to be a good one. For, that which is prone to disgraceful things, and capable of rapid growth, stands in need of pruning or chastisement. But such proneness and such growth are principally characteristic of desire and of childhood. For, children, like over-indulgent people, live by desire and not by reason, and the longing for pleasure is stronger in them than anywhere else. If, then, this tendency is not obedient and subject to authority, it will greatly develop. For, the desire for pleasure which a foolish person has is insatiable and universal, and the active exercise of the desire increases its natural strength, until the desires, if they are strong or passionate, actually expel the reasoning power. They ought therefore to be moderate and few, and in no way contrary to reason. But we speak of such a disposition as “obedient” and “chastened”; for just as a child ought to live according to the direction of his tutor, so ought the appetitive element in people live according to the reason. In the temperate person, then, the appetitive element should live in harmony with the reason, since the object of them both is that which is right. The temperate person desires what is right, and desires it in the right way, and at the right time, that is, according to the law of reason. We may now bring our discussion of temperance to a close.

**INTRODUCTION**

“The Underwear Bomber” is the name given to a Nigerian man in his early twenties who some years ago attempted to detonate an explosive device hidden in his underwear while onboard a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit. The bomber had lit the device, but was quickly subdued by a fellow passenger who heard popping noises and detected a burning odor. He was arrested, put on trial in U.S. Federal court, and found guilty of several charges including the attempted murder of 289 people. He was then sentenced to four life terms in prison without the possibility of parole. The bomber's motivations were blatantly religious. At the trial, the Judge stated that “The defendant has never expressed doubt or remorse about his mission. . . . To the contrary, he sees that mission as divinely inspired and a continuing mission.” During sentencing, the bomber himself shouted that he was proud to kill in the name of God, and that is what God told us to do in scripture.

             Religious believers typically think that it is a good thing to follow the will of God. God commands us to do what is right and just, and the Underwear Bomber is a worst case scenario of someone committing an evil act allegedly in obedience to God’s orders. The important philosophical question this raises is whether God—assuming that he exists—could ever command someone to do an otherwise immoral act. Does God simply invent moral rules as he sees fit, or does God himself answer to a higher standard? A long-standing tradition in religious ethics called _divine command theory_ holds that God indeed creates moral rules purely as a function of his free will. If God chooses to make a specific standard of morality, it thereby becomes moral simply as a result of him willing it so. If God chooses to make murder wrong, it thereby becomes wrong. But so too of other possible actions. If God chooses to make it morally obligatory for everyone to hop around on one foot on Thursdays, that action then becomes morally obligatory. Perhaps God could even willfully reverse the rules of morality and make an act like murder morally permissible.

             In this chapter, we will look at the central arguments for and against divine command theory. This theory is at the heart of many disputes about the relation between religion and ethics. It raises questions about whether the concept of God plays a critical role in moral judgments, whether it is possible to have a purely secular standard of right and wrong, and whether religious believers are in a privileged position to know moral truth. The Underwear Bomber and like-minded religious terrorists claim that they are in such a privileged position. But it is not just the terrorists. Several of society’s most controversial moral issues today—such as abortion, euthanasia, capital punishment, gay marriage—invariably involve claims about moral standards that God presumably established. The more we understand the theories about morality and God’s will, the better we may be able to make sense of these claims.

**The Euthyphro Dilemma**

The philosophical issue surrounding morality and the will of God first came to light in the writings of the ancient Greek philosopher Plato (428–348 BCE) in his dialogue _Euthyphro_. In that work, a character named Euthyphro is prepared to turn his father over to the authorities for mistreating and causing the death of a slave. In ancient Greece, children were expected to show unconditional loyalty to their parents, and so, by turning in his father, Euthyphro would be violating the standard code of morality. Nevertheless, Euthyprho believes that he is following the will of the gods and therefore doing the right thing. On his way to the courthouse, Euthyphro bumps into Socrates, and the two start debating on the connection between morality and religious obedience. Socrates then poses this question to Euthyphro: “Are good things good because the gods approve of them, or do the gods approve of them because they are good?” This question is now known as the _Euthyphro Dilemma_, and, reworded in more modern terminology, the two options in the dilemma are these:

(1) God creates moral standards from scratch without any source of guidance.

(2) Moral standards exist independently of God, and God merely endorses them.

To clarify, the first option is that God is the sole author of morality, and something becomes good when God simply wills and pronounces that it is good. For example, God might will that children should show unconditional loyalty to their parents, and, by so willing, it is thereby morally good and obligatory that children do this. In this view, if God will that something should be morally good, then it simply _becomes_ morally good.

             The second option is that good things are objectively good, and God merely recognizes them as such. For example, it may be objectively good and obligatory for children to show unconditional loyalty to their parents, and God just endorses this moral standard. In this view, morality is grounded in a preexisting standard of moral goodness, which God himself has no control over and must adopt. The genius of Plato’s puzzle is that these are the only two choices available for explaining the connection between God and morality: God either invents it from scratch or abides by an independent standard. Further, since we cannot endorse both of these options at the same time, we are locked into choosing one over the other. Plato himself believed that morality is grounded in external and preexisting standards, and so he went with the second option. By doing so, he rejects the first option that God invents morality.

             Although Plato took the second option, during the Middle Ages philosophers seriously considered both positions. The medieval writers who debated this issue were typically part of the natural law tradition of moral philosophy. That is, they all roughly held that God endorses specific moral standards and fixes them in human nature. We then discover these natural laws of morality through our conscience or through reflection on our natural human inclinations. Although natural law philosophers agreed on these basic points, they disagreed about where God got moral standards to begin with. Again, the two options were those presented by Plato. Some of these philosophers boldly embraced the first option: moral principles are purely creations of God’s will, and are not grounded in anything else—not even reason or an externally existing rational standard. This position has been called _voluntarism_, from the Latin term _voluntas_ for “will”, and in recent years it more commonly goes by the name of “divine command theory,” as we will call it in this chapter. Other philosophers took the second position: God does not literally author moral standards, but instead advocates moral standards are independently grounded in reason; they have a rational quality in and of themselves. God as a rational being has a kinship with all rational principles, including standards of morality. Since God created humans as rational creatures, we, too, have the capacity to rationally grasp these moral principles. This position is called _intellectualism_, insofar as it emphasizes the view that moral principles originate from reason and God’s rational intellect.

**SCOTUS’S DIVINE COMMAND THEORY**

One of the great defenders of divine command theory in the Middle Ages was Scottish-born philosopher John Duns Scotus (1266–1308), whose views are a good model for understanding divine command theories in the succeeding centuries. In this section we will examine the key features of his theory.

**Scotus’s Theory**

There are two components to his view. First, he believed that God has a _genuinely free will_ in the sense that God could have willed things differently than he actually did. Suppose, for example, that God willed to create the planet Mars at a specific point in time. At the precise moment that he willed to make Mars, God could have willed instead to _not_ create it. A genuinely free will, for Scotus, is unconstrained by prior reasons or causes.

             The second component of Scotus’s view is that God has _absolute power_ in the sense that God can bring about anything that he wants, so long as it does not involve a logical contradiction. He makes this point here:

God, therefore, insofar as he is able to act in accord with those right laws he set up previously, is said to act according to his ordained power. But insofar as he is able to do many things that are not in accord with, but go beyond, these [divinely] preestablished laws, God is said to act according to his absolute power. For God can do anything that is not self-contradictory or act in any way that does not include a contradiction (and there are many such ways he could act); and then he is said to be acting according to his absolute power. [_Oxford Commentary_, 1.44, tr. Allan B. Wolter]

In this passage, Scotus explains that God has two kinds of powers: ordained and absolute. _Ordained_ power involves a basic ability for God to act in accord with laws that he previously sets up, such as laws of salvation or laws of physics. By contrast, God’s _absolute_ power involves a stronger ability to act contrary to his previously established laws, and God can do this in any way that he wants, so long as there is no logical contradiction. A statement is logically contradictory when it both asserts and denies the same thing. Take, for example, the statement that “Bob is a married bachelor.” Since the definition of “bachelor” includes being unmarried, this statement is contradictory insofar as it implies that Bob is both married and unmarried. Similarly, the statement “Bob has a tattoo of a round square” is contradictory since it implies that a specific shape simultaneously contains and lacks 90–degree angles. Thus, even with his absolute power, God could not make a “married bachelor” or a “round squares” since these are contradictory notions.

             When we combine God’s free will with his absolute power, we see that God is _free_ to do what he wants and that he has the _power_ to do it—so long as there are no logical contradictions. We can better understand the scope of God’s free will and absolute power by considering three kinds of laws:

• Physical laws, such as the law of gravity

• Mathematical laws, such as “2 + 2 = 4”

• Logical laws, such as the law of identity (the Empire State Building is the Empire State Building)

According to Scotus, God’s absolute power gives him control over some of these laws, but not others. That is, he has control over physical laws, but not mathematical or logical ones. Concerning physical laws, Scotus quickly grants that God has creative control over the structure of the physical world and the rules that govern it. For any physical law that we pick, such as gravity, God could have made it differently without logical contradiction. For example, it would not be logically contradictory for physical objects to be repelled by each other, rather than gravitationally attracted. However, mathematical and logical laws are unlike physical laws: they cannot be different from what they are now without logical contradiction. It is logically absurd to say that 2 plus 2 equal 5, or that the Empire State Building is not identical to itself. Since Scotus holds that God cannot perform logically contradictory tasks, he would reject the view that God has power over mathematics and logic.

             When we turn to the issue of moral laws, we must determine whether they are more like physical laws, which God has control over, or mathematical and logical laws, which God does not. Scotus believes that moral laws are more like physical laws, which God does have control over. For Scotus, God first freely wills a specific conception of morality and then institutes these values through his absolute power. He creates these without reliance on any preexisting external standards, and he implants knowledge of them in our human nature.

             Scotus’s divine command theory creates a paradox: If morality is a creation of God’s will, then God could will whatever moral values he wants, even the exact opposite of present moral values. For example, although God in fact mandates that stealing is wrong, he could have made stealing morally permissible. So, too, for killing, lying, and marital infidelity. Therefore, God’s moral commands seem arbitrary. Scotus is willing to accept this paradox and all of its strange implications. In fact, he believes that at specific points in history God actually did reverse the rules of morality to suit his own special purposes. He draws attention to three particular stories from the Hebrew Bible in which several of the Hebrew patriarchs commit seemingly immoral acts at God’s command.

To kill, to steal, to commit adultery, are against the precepts of the decalogue, as is clear from Exodus [20:13]: “You shall not kill” [etc.]. Yet God seems to have dispensed from these. This is clear in regard to homicide from Genesis 22, regarding Abraham and the son he was about to sacrifice; or for theft from Exodus 11 [: 2] and [12: 35] where he ordered the sons of Israel to despoil the Egyptians, which despoilment is taking what belongs to another without the owner’s consent, which is the definition of theft. As for the third, there is Hosea 1: “Make children of fornications.” [_Oxford Commentary_, 3.37]

These three stories are often referred to as the “immoralities of the patriarchs.” The first one depicts how God commands Abraham to offer his son as a human sacrifice. At the last minute, as Abraham raises his knife, God provides an animal as a substitute. Nevertheless, Abraham’s intent is already fixed, and he attempts to carry out the act in accord with God’s will. The second story relates how, just before the Israelites leave Egypt, God commands them to steal vessels from their Egyptian neighbors. In the third story, God commands Hosea to have sex with an adulteress.

             Scotus believes that these are genuine examples of God granting a special dispensation or privilege for these people. By allowing such exceptions, God is temporarily revoking a specific moral law and setting up a new and possibly opposite standard in its place:

Any legislator dispenses unconditionally when he revokes a precept of positive law made by himself. He does not allow the prohibited act or precept to remain as before, but removes the prohibition or makes what was formerly illicit now licit. [_Oxford Commentary_, 3.37]

Scotus concludes that God could alter virtually all of the moral laws if he wanted. The only exceptions are moral laws involving our subservience to God, such as the commands to love, worship and obey God. To alter these, God would need to stop being the infinitely great God that he is, and because doing so would be in contradiction to God’s nature, God cannot do this.

             To recap, these are the main points of Scotus’s divine command theory:

• God has a genuinely free will, which is unconstrained by prior reasons or causes.

• God has absolute power insofar as he can do anything that is logically possible.

• Moral standards are creations of God’s will, and God can alter them without logical contradiction.

• Some biblical stories depict God revoking previously established moral standards.

Scotus’s theory as described above contains two central arguments for divine command theory: (1) an argument from revoking established moral standards and (2) an argument from absolute power. We will examine each of these in turn.

**The Argument from Revoking Established Moral Standards**

We’ve seen that Scotus argues that the Bible give us examples of how God temporarily revokes previously established moral standards for special purposes. Since God has the ability to revoke these standards, this implies that these standards are creations of God. Put more precisely, the argument is this:

1. If God has the ability to temporarily revoke a moral standard, then he has the power to freely create moral standards.

2. Some divinely inspired texts depict God as temporarily revoking a previously established moral standard.

3. Therefore, God has the power to freely create moral standards.

The success of this argument depends on the truth of premises 1 and 2. However, both of these premises have problems.

             Premise 1 makes the basic claim that, if someone has the power to revoke a standard, then that person had the initial power to create that standard. This is a reasonable assumption. Suppose, for example, that the state of California decided to raise the speed limit on its highways from 70 miles per hour to 80 miles per hour. If state government officials have the authority to revoke the 70-mile-per-hour limit, then it is reasonable to assume they are the ones who created that speed limit to begin with. Scotus addresses this point when describing the distinction between God’s two kinds of powers. With his ordained power, God can establish basic laws, such as that of gravity. With his absolute power, though, God is able to move beyond the laws that he has previously established, and even go against them if he so chooses. For Scotus, then, God’s power to revoke a law is tied with his power to create a law, and premise 1 is fine.

             Premise 2 states that some divinely inspired texts depict God as temporarily revoking a previously established moral standard. The biblical stories of the immoralities of the patriarchs seem to be examples of this. One problem with these cases is that they carry weight only for believers within religious traditions that recognize the authority of specific scriptures. In the case of stories from the Hebrew Bible, these principally carry weight for Jews and Christians, who constitute only a minority of the world’s population. Hindus, Buddhists, Muslims, and members of other religions might find these stories interesting but not authoritative.

             For the sake of argument, let’s confine our discussion to the stories from the Hebrew Bible and to the Jews and Christians who see these stories as authoritative. Even so, there is still a second problem with premise 2: These cases do not conclusively illustrate God revoking moral standards. Take, for example, the story of Abraham preparing to kill his son. Although murder is certainly wrong, it is often difficult to determine whether an act of killing is unjustified to the point that it constitutes murder. If an intruder breaks into my house and threatens my family, I may be justified in killing him and, so, it may not count as murder per se. To determine if an act of killing rises to the level of murder, we must examine the context of a person’s act and consider his or her motivations.

             If Abraham slaughtered his son for no good reason, then that would certainly appear to be murder. Medieval philosopher Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274) also examines the Abraham story, along with the other two immoralities of the patriarchs. For Aquinas, Abraham does have a reason for preparing to kill his son, and this reason involves a God’s ultimate role in the life-and-death process:

All men alike, both guilty and innocent, die the death of nature: which death of nature is inflicted by the power of God on account of original sin, according to 1 Kings 2:6: “The Lord killeth and maketh alive.” Consequently, by the command of God, death can be inflicted on any man, guilty or innocent, without any injustice whatever. [_Summa Theologica_, 1a-1ae, q. 94.5]

According to Aquinas, God has ultimate authority over when and how anyone dies. Therefore, although it might be wrong for Abraham to kill his son on his own, it would not be wrong for him to carry out God’s orders since God is and always was the final authority over human life.

             Aquinas similarly rationalizes the situations of the Israelites’ leaving town with the property of their Egyptian neighbors and Hosea sleeping with an adulteress. Once again, although stealing and adultery are immoral, Aquinas argues that God ultimately owns all property and spouses, and he can assign them to whomever he wants. Even if we do not agree with Aquinas’s precise explanations, his larger point is still valid: The biblical stories do not conclusively depict God revoking previously established moral standards. There will always be ways to explain the patriarchs’ motives which absolve them of moral crime. Thus, there are serious problems with premise 2 that force us to reject the argument from revoking established moral standards.

**The Argument from Absolute Power**

Scotus offers a second argument for the position that God freely creates moral standards, an argument that is grounded in the notion of absolute power. If God has absolute power, then he can do anything, including create moral principles in any way that he sees fit. The more precise argument is this:

1. If a being is absolutely powerful, then that being can freely create moral standards, so long as they are without contradiction.

2. God is absolutely powerful.

3. Therefore, God can freely create moral standards, so long as they are without contradiction.

Again, the success of this argument rests on the truth of premises 1 and 2.

             Premise 1 draws on Scotus’s notion of absolute power—namely the ability to do anything that does not involve a contradiction. Premise 1 also claims that, in principle, moral standards can be created and altered in various ways without logical contradiction. For example, according to Scotus, it is not _logically_ contradictory to state that “some acts of murder, theft, and adultery are morally obligatory.” Suppose that we define the notions of “murder,” “theft” and “adultery” in the most damning way, with malice aforethought, criminal intent, and guilty mind. Even so, there is still no logical contradiction such as we find in the statement “Bob is a married bachelor.” The reason is that, for Scotus, the notion of moral obligation is linked to what God freely wills. Suppose that I say “It is morally obligatory for Bob to murder someone.” This, at its very worst, translates into “God freely willed Bob to kill someone with malice aforethought, criminal intent, and guilty mind.” There is no contradiction here. We may object that there is a better way to define the notion of moral obligation that what Scotus offers. But that does not matter. Premise 1 presents us only with a possibility: “_if_ a being is absolutely powerful. . . .” That is, if we assume that an absolutely powerful being exists, it follows that that being can, without logical contradiction, morally obligate Bob to murder someone. Premise 1, then, is acceptable. That is, moral standards might be created and altered in various ways without logical contradiction.

             The success of this argument, then, rests on premise 2: God is absolutely powerful. According to this premise, there exists a God who has the power to do anything that does not involve a logical contradiction. Should we accept this premise? There are three problems with it. First, on its face, it is an argument geared towards believers. Nonbelievers would certainly reject it, in which case the argument stops here dead in its tracks. However, let’s proceed with the believer in mind. Should the believer accept that God is absolutely powerful? Medieval philosophers devised proofs to demonstrate that there exists a God that has infinitely great qualities—including the power to do all logically possible things. Scotus himself formulated one of the most elaborate proofs ever for God’s existence. Suppose, though, that we are not convinced by such proofs, or that we are not even interested in spending countless hours wading through the details of these proofs to see if they work. The second problem with this premise, then, is that the believer himself may not have good reason or adequate proof to accept the truth of premise 2.

             But let’s still proceed further. The believer might instead wish simply to accept as a matter of personal faith that God has absolute power. For traditional believers, the idea of a God with limited power does not make much sense. Who would want to believe in a puny God with restricted abilities? Instead, a dedicated believer motivated by a sense of devotion might want to attribute as much power to God as possible, including creative power over moral principles. So, a strong sense of religious devotion might incline the believer to accept premise 2. However, the justification for premise 2 now hinges on the particular wants and motives for belief in a God with absolute power. This, then leads to the third problem with premise 2: the believer’s faith-based belief in divine absolute power may be based on motives that are less than admirable. Perhaps it is only wishful thinking—just as we might hope to hit the big lottery jackpot.

             Perhaps it is also motivated by what we might call _spiritual gluttony_, the desire to heap greater and greater qualities onto God. How much power must we ascribe to God before we are psychologically content in our devotion toward him? A believer may certainly be compelled to believe in a God who is very powerful. But as the believer heaps more and more powerful abilities on God, there is a point at which ascribing that extra power is unnecessary for spiritual contentment and even collapses into self-indulgence. Suppose, for example, that I love to eat apples, and for the next month I vow to eat nothing but apples. During this one-month period, there would be physical limits to the number of apples I could eat—say, about 1000 apples. Suppose, too, that a local apple grower decides to support my efforts during that one-month period and drops off a truckload of 1000 apples. Ungraciously, I protest, “That’s not good enough, and I demand 2000 apples even though I will not be able to eat them all!” Like my desire for more apples than I can eat, a believer can stipulate more divine power than the believer actually needs to be spiritually satisfied, and anything beyond that is something like spiritual gluttony.

             Whether it is from wishful thinking or spiritual gluttony, the desire to believe in a God with absolute power might be driven in part by personal craving. The Hindu _Bhagavad Gita_ discusses the role that such craving can play in the mind of the believer, such as heavenly rewards, and maintains that it is the least admirable form of religious faith:

The foolish utter flowery speech, and rejoice in the letter of the Vedas [i.e., Hindu scriptures]. For them there is nothing but a desire for the self with only the intent on reaching heaven. (_Bhagavad Gita_, 2)

This passage condemns established religious practices that are rooted in the believer’s selfish desires. The _Bhagavad Gita_ recommends that we distance ourselves from any personal benefit that our faith might give us. Although traditional Christians may resist taking spiritual advice from Hindu texts, this particular point in the _Bhagavad Gita_ is universal: Selfish interests should not guide faith. Accordingly, it is not appropriate for us to grant God creative power over moral principles when we are merely motivated by wishful thinking, spiritual gluttony, or heavenly rewards. This is especially so when we are talking about religiously-based moral judgments that impact others in society, such as the moral beliefs of the Underwear Bomber.

             Certainly there are believers who will have purer motives and still be compelled to accept premise 2. Nevertheless, at this stage we can conclude that the truth or acceptance of premise 2 is by no means clear, either for the non-believer or even the believer. Thus, the success of the argument from absolute power remains in question.

**Divine Command Theory After Scotus**

Scotus's conviction that God could change the rules of morality was a bold and controversial one. But, as we have seen, he stopped short by saying that God could not reverse the moral command that we should love God. For Scotus, it would be logically contradictory for God to command people to not worship him, and this is something that even God cannot do. But shortly after Scotus, English-born philosopher William of Ockham (1285–1349) pushed the conclusions of divine command theory further than Scotus did. Ockham believed that God could revoke virtually any moral law he wanted. For example, Ockham argued that, although God will in fact punish us for being immoral, nothing requires him to do so. And, supposing that we did not repent, God could still grant us forgiveness and not punish us, if that’s what God wanted to do. Taking this a step further he argued that, although God commands us to love him, God could command us to hate him instead:

Every will can conform to the commands of God. God can, however, command a created will to hate Him. Therefore, the created will can do this. Moreover, any act that can be just on earth could also be just in heaven. On earth the hatred of God can be just, if it is commanded by God Himself. Therefore, the hatred of God could also be just in heaven. [_Fourth Book of the Sentences_, 13, tr., Lucan Freppert]

Ockham argues here that, if God did command us to hate him, then this would in fact be the morally right thing to do. This statement was so controversial that it contributed to his excommunication from the Catholic Church in 1328.

             In the centuries after Scotus and Ockham, advocates continued to line up on both sides of the debate between divine command theory and intellectualism. The dispute became so central to ethical theory that virtually every moral philosopher, Catholic or Protestant, felt compelled to weigh in on whether morality is a creation of God’s will. During the Enlightenment, the most influential philosopher on the intellectualist side Hugo Grotius (1583–1645), who argued that God cannot change moral standards:

The [moral] law of nature, again, is unchangeable—even in the sense that it cannot be changed by God. Measureless as is the power of God, nevertheless it can be said that there are certain things over which that power does not extend; for things of which this is said are spoken only, having no sense corresponding with reality and being mutually contradictory. Just as even God, then, cannot cause that two times two should not make four, so he cannot cause that that which is intrinsically evil be not evil. [_Law of War and Peace_, 1.10.5]

In this passage, Grotius appears to accept the notion of God’s absolute power as Scotus defined it—namely, the ability to do anything that is not logically contradictory. However, Grotius rejects divine command theory by suggesting that moral laws are similar to mathematical laws, which cannot be altered without logical contradiction. As we’ve seen, divine command theorists such as Scotus believe that moral laws are more like physical laws, which can be changed without contradiction. Grotius, then, does not technically ascribe less power to God’s abilities, but instead elevates the status of moral standards, placing them beyond God’s reach. Grotius even makes the bold claim that natural law would still have some validity even if “we conceded that there is no God” (ibid, Prolegomena).

             In the succeeding centuries, many critics of divine command theory have similarly claimed that moral standards are eternal and immutable, and even God cannot change them. Although rejecting divine command theory per se, many of these philosophers believed that God’s will still plays at least some role in morality. Suppose, for example, that by using my reason I learn the eternal moral truth that I should not steal from other people. Although I now know that I should not steal, I nevertheless may not be _motivated_ to actually follow this moral rule. And that’s where God’s will enters the picture. If God wills that we should all follow these eternal moral truths—and we do not want to disappoint God—then we’ll all be motivated to follow them. God encourages us to be moral and will punish us for immoral conduct, which has an impact on our motivation to be moral. So, even though God does not willfully _create_ moral truths, he willfully _mandates_ them on humans, and this motivates us to be moral. It is like saying, “Stealing is wrong and, by the way, God will punish you if you steal.” This is similar to saying “Stealing is wrong and, by the way, the cops will get you if you steal.”

**CRITICISMS OF DIVINE COMMAND THEORY**

So far we’ve rejected both the argument from revoking established moral standards and the argument from absolute power. However, it is important to note that even if both of these arguments fail, this does not necessarily mean that divine command theory is false. It only means that these _specific_ two arguments fail as proofs for the view that morality is a creation of God’s will. But critics have gone a step further and presented arguments directly against divine command theory, and we will look at three of these.

**Cudworth’s Criticism: Morality becomes Arbitrary**

One of the most prominent criticisms of divine command theory is that it makes the standards of morality completely arbitrary. According to divine command theory, the foundation of all morality is the willful choice of God, which stands independently of any influence of reason. God’s choice is not based on an externally-existing standard of morality, such as the forms, and it is not grounded in God’s rational capacity. Rather, it flows only from God’s choice, pure and simple. We cannot even say that God would choose a reasonable set of moral standards, since that would make God depend upon an independent standard of what counts as “reasonable.” But, according to divine command theory, the buck stops with God’s will. This means that he can will any moral standards that he wants, completely unconstrained by reason, the moral forms, or any other consideration.

             Ralph Cudworth (1617-1688) presents this criticism here:

certain it is, that diverse modern theologers do not only seriously, but zealously contend. . _. that there is nothing absolutely, intrinsically, and naturally good and evil, just and unjust, antecedently to any positive command or prohibition of God; but that the arbitrary will of God. . . by its commands and prohibitions, is the first and only rule and measure thereof_. Whence it follows unavoidably, that nothing can be imagined so grossly wicked, or so foully unjust or dishonest, but if it were supposed to be commanded by this Omnipotent Deity, must needs upon that hypothesis forthwith become holy, just and righteous. [_A Treatise Concerning Eternal and Immutable Morality_ 1.1.5]

In the above, Cudworth says that defenders of divine command theory deny that anything is morally good or bad in and of itself, and that it is only God’s arbitrary act of the will that defines the moral status of any action. The problem with divine command theory, as Cudworth sees it, is that it elevates God’s will to the point that it eclipses all other divine attributes, including divine wisdom. By doing so, as Cudworth states it, “God is a mere arbitrary will omnipotent” (ibid, Preface). That is, God _is_ his all-powerful and arbitrary will. The direct result of this is that God arbitrarily selects some actions as good, and others as bad. And, if God had willed things differently, Cudworth says, “that which is now good might have been bad, and bad good” (ibid).

             There is no question that many divine command theorists throughout history have embraced the notion that God arbitrarily designates some actions as good and others evil. Cudworth even quotes from one such philosopher who boldly states the following: “There is no act evil but as it is prohibited by God, and which cannot be made good if it be commanded by God. And so on the other hand as to God.” Thus, it may be an uphill battle to defend divine command theorists against an aspect of their position which they so clearly assert. In this sense, the divine command theorist is actually supplying a troubling criticism against his own theory.

             One possible response to Cudworth’s criticism is to say that, while God _can_ arbitrarily create morality, he is _actually_ influenced by his attributes of love and wisdom and, thus has dictated a compassionate and reasonable set of moral standards. But this will not help. According to divine command theory, God’s will surpasses all of his other attributes. If he was guided by his love or wisdom, then he would be deferring to some standard outside of his will, which is precisely what the theory of intellectualism holds. What is central to divine command theory is God’s unconstrained will, and this excludes appeals to other sources of moral value, such as love or wisdom.

             The best response to Cudworth’s criticism is to first simply concede the fundamental point that God arbitrarily dictated moral standards. That being settled, the defender of divine command theory might then attempt to judge the reasonableness of those standards from our own human perspective. Did God do a good job with his selection of moral principles? Do any seem irrational? Are there some that we wish he willed differently? What matters is whether we, as rational beings, feel that moral principles are decent ones and we can reasonably live with them. If so, then it is irrelevant whether those moral principles are dictates of God’s will or his reason. It may seems odd to say that God arbitrarily selected moral values that we as humans find reasonable. But this is no odder than belief in God itself. A running theme in religions across the globe is that God is a mystery: the divine being is beyond human comprehension, and we cannot fully understand divine actions. If this mystery is a given within religions, then it seems unfair to penalize divine command theory for tracing morality back to the mysterious divine nature. For divine command theorists, the mystery is not within the moral principles themselves, but within God’s nature. 

**Bentham’s Criticism:** **Unclear Indicators of God’s Will**

A second common criticism of divine command theory is that it wrongly supposes that we can easily identify the will of God and his moral commands. Assuming that God does create some kind of moral standard that we need to follow, there needs to be some way that we can gain knowledge of this. Granted, the divine command theorist will say that God communicates his will through both scripture and personal revelation. He has made record of his laws and expectations in sacred texts, and by studying these we can know what he wills. He also speaks directly to believers through an inner conviction, a quiet voice, or pangs of conscience. Between scripture and personal revelation, we learn everything we need to know about God’s intentions. However, says the critic, both of these avenues are too imprecise to offer clear guidance. The Underwear Bomber himself appealed to scripture when claiming that God commanded him and others to kill religious heretics. Scriptures require interpretation, and the mere fact that there are so many religions and denominations within those religions speaks to how difficult precise interpretation is. Personal revelation is even more unreliable, and we are normally suspicious of people who claim that God spoke to them. Frequently, claims to be morally guided by God are thinly veiled attempts to justify one’s private moral biases, such as claiming that interracial marriages are against the will of God.

             The point of this criticism is that scripture and personal revelation are such unclear indicators of God’s will, that we actually need some prior standard of moral judgment that is independent of God. For example, when the Underwear Bomber claims that scripture tells us that it is God’s will for believers to kill heretics, we need some prior conception of morality to judge that _specific_ text to see if it really means this. English philosopher Jeremy Bentham argues this here:

The _will_ of God here meant cannot be his revealed will, as contained in the sacred writings. . . . [since] it is universally allowed, by the most eminent divines of all persuasions, to stand in need of pretty ample interpretations; else to what use are the works of those divines? And for the guidance of these interpretations, it is also allowed, that some other standard must be assumed. [_Principles of Morals and Legislation_, 2.13]

This prior conception of morality, then, must be independent of God and God’s revelation itself. Further, the believer’s choice to worship God shows that the believer is using an independent standard of goodness by which he deems God worthy of worship. Even if the believer claims that through faith alone he believes God is worthy of worship, at some level the believer is appealing to an independent standard of goodness.

             This criticism cannot easily be brushed aside, and, short of God himself appearing before the world and stipulating his will, there will always be room to doubt claims to know the will of God. While divine command theorists may not be able to fully overcome this criticism, they do have a response. The task of discovering God’s will is not primarily one for individual believers, such as the Underwear Bomber. Rather, it is the task of moral and religious traditions that extend back many generations. These traditions contain a rich history of thoughtful reflection on how scriptures should be interpreted, and how we should understand personal revelations. Every world religion and religious denomination is shaped by its own tradition and history, and that becomes the standard by which they determine the will of God. Generally speaking, religions acknowledge that function of their tradition, and maintain that that’s how God wants it. Again, this does not fully remove the difficulty in identifying the will of God, since even here we can always ask whether a given religious tradition is making the proper judgment calls. However, it removes the task from individual people with their private biases, inconsistencies, and emotional problems.

**Leibniz’s Criticism: Divine Goodness becomes Meaningless**

A third common criticism of divine command theory is that if God does create moral goodness, then we cannot meaningfully say about God himself that “God is morally good.” German philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716) makes this point here:

In saying… that things are not good according to any standard of goodness, but simply by the will of God, it seems to me that one destroys, without realizing it, all the love of God and all his glory; for why praise him for what he has done, if he would be equally praiseworthy in doing the contrary? [_Discourse on Metaphysics_, 2]

According to divine command theory, “moral goodness” simply means “that which God wills,” as expressed in this definition:

“X is morally good” means “X does that which God wills.”

There may be other possible wordings of this definition that highlight different aspects of divine command theory, but for our purposes this one is sufficient. This definition by itself does not present problems when we make moral statements about humans. Suppose, for example, that I say, “Bob is morally good.” Based on the above definition of moral goodness, this statement translates as “Bob does that which God wills,” and this is a perfectly meaningful statement. However, suppose that I next say, “God is morally good.” Based on the above definition of moral goodness, this statement translates as “God does that which he wills”—that is, God simply lives up to his own standards. Here the notion of divine moral goodness is lost. If divine command theory is true, then moral statements about God are not nearly as meaningful as moral statements about humans.

             According to Leibniz, then, the divine command theorist implicitly abandons any meaningful notion of divine moral goodness. This is a problem since, as Leibniz suggests, without a substantive concept of moral goodness, God would not be much more than an all-powerful bully who imposes his will on everyone.

             But the divine command theorist has a way out: the statement “God does what he wills” is embedded with other notions that believers will find meaningful. Let’s assume that moral goodness is indeed defined by God’s will. That is, assume that all moral standards and values are tied directly with God’s will, with no independent reference outside of it. This will include all moral principles that we currently recognize, such as prohibitions against lying, stealing and murder, and duties to be benevolent and charitable. The key question, then, is whether God practices what he preaches. That is, does he also follow the list of moral principles that he mandates for us? It is possible that he sets different standards for humans than for himself. For example, maybe he has willed that humans should not lie, but at the same time wills that it is OK for God himself to lie. Answering the question of whether God practices what he preaches is virtually impossible since it would require reading the divine mind. We cannot read the minds of other humans, and it is all the more difficult with a transcendent being whose very existence cannot be known with certainty.

             However, this simple question of whether God practices what he preaches allows us to modify the divine command theorist’s definition of divine goodness—using some basic principles of logic. To say that “God is morally good” also means the following:

God does what he wills, and he either abides by the same set of standards that he has set for humans or he does not.

On first glance this may seem as empty as the original statement that “God does what he wills,” since the added clause merely says that “God may or may not practice what he preaches.” But there is an important difference. When believers’ lives are ravaged by tragedy, they often wonder how God could have permitted their suffering, and whether he acts compassionately and justly just as he commands of us. They are in essence asking whether God practices what he preaches. The above modified statement holds open the possibility that God does abide by the same set of standards that he sets for us. As an act of faith, the devout believer will give God the benefit of the doubt and say that he does. This presumption may be false if God does not follow the same standards that he sets for us. But the very question of whether he practices what he preaches is one which sparks a faith response that makes the notion of divine goodness as meaningful as any other commitment of religious faith. In short, divine command theory does not make the notion of divine goodness as meaningless as the critic maintains.

**LINGERING PROBLEMS WITH RELIGIOUS ETHICS**

So far we have seen that the arguments supporting divine command theory fail, but the criticisms of it by Bentham and Leibniz also fail. Thus, the jury is still out about the overall viability of the theory. Divine command theorists and intellectualists differed about whether God creates moral standards, but both held equally that God is an important component in morality. Virtually no one publicly questioned the existence of God until the eighteenth century, and philosophers commonly held that no true atheists either did exist or could exist. So, the climate was well suited for mixing morality and religious belief. Since the eighteenth century, however, the tables have turned regarding the connection between religion and morality. Scientifically-minded moral philosophers of the eighteenth century attempted to create a science of ethics, which, like the physical sciences, stands independently of religious doctrines. During the nineteenth century, several philosophers and scientists publicly affirmed atheism or agnosticism, and this further established a secular agenda for moral philosophy. We’ve inherited this secular agenda, and an academic book on ethics published today might not mention “God” even once. In recent years, the tables have turned against religious morality so much that contemporary moral philosophers view with suspicion, simply dismiss, or even ridicule those who vocalize any religious ethics. What, though, is so bad about linking morality with God? Even if society will never again return to a time when religious ethics will dominate, might there be some room for believers to exercise their views within ethical discourse?

**Secular Criticisms of Religious Morality**

Secular moral theorists do not seem upset with the aspects of religious ethics that aim to reinforce traditional morality with the component of divine punishment, such as by saying that God will punish thieves. The big problem for critics, though, is when believers merely stipulate that God morally endorses a particular type of conduct. For example, the Underwear Bomber claimed that he was simply following God’s command to kill. The mere mention of this is likely to make anyone cringe—believer and nonbeliever alike. Critics have the same negative response when believers appeal to God’s authority concerning a wide range of moral issues, such as abortion, homosexuality, interracial marriages, and handgun ownership. When pressed, the believer might justify his views by appealing to the Bible, to religious tradition, or to his religious conscience. Again, though, we must ask, what is so bad about this? There are three problems that the critic of religious ethics might point out; we will note these, plus responses that the believer might give to these criticisms.

             First, according to critics, appealing to religious intuitions on moral issues is a conversation stopper. We would like to at least open a dialog on an issue, but we cannot since the believer quickly appeals to his foundational and non-negotiable religious assumption. In response, the believer maintains that there is room for dialog within his religious tradition but that the critic stops the conversation with her secular viewpoint. In one fell swoop, the critic shuts off an entire range of religious-based discourse because of her own foundational and non-negotiable secular assumptions. If there is a stoppage of conversation, says the believer, much of the fault rests with the critic.

             Second, the critic might argue that the believer’s chain of reasoning is not long enough and rests too quickly on his foundational religious assumption. Proper ethical decisions involve detailed reasoning, but the typical believer has a one-step reasoning process. Abortion, for example, is wrong because the believer’s religious intuitions tell him so. In response, other nonreligious moral theories also have a one-step reasoning process. A utilitarian, for example, might argue that it is wrong to torture animals since this increases the quantity of pain in the world. A rights theorist might argue that stealing a car is wrong since it violates individuals’ property rights. What is relevant in these cases is (1) the strength of the initial moral standard, such as the importance of reducing pain, and (2) the applicability of the moral standard to a given issue, such as torturing animals. So, if we dismiss religious ethics because it involves a one-step reasoning process, then we must also dismiss many secular theories for also being one-step reasoning processes.

             Finally, the critic might argue that the believer blindly perpetuates bigotry when pronouncing, for example, that God commands men to be in charge of women, or God is against interracial marriage, or God despises gays. In response, bigotry is certainly bad, but if there is a link between bigotry and religious ethics, it is at most a sociological connection, and not a logical one. Religious intuitions do not logically entail that believers should single out and unjustly condemn specific groups of people. And even from a sociological perspective, it is not immediately clear that believers in religious ethics tend more toward bigotry than does the population as a whole. Unless such a connection can be established through responsible sociological studies, then it is bigotry itself to dismiss proponents of religious ethics as bigots simply on the basis of a hunch.

             Secular moral theorists may be bothered by appeals to religious intuitions for additional reasons. But, secularists are not justified in declaring a monopoly on the field of ethics by restricting it to only nonreligious approaches, which historically are relatively recent and geographically are confined mostly to Western culture.

**Limits of Religious Appeals**

Even if secular moral theorists have overstated their resistance to religious ethics, there are still limits to religious appeals in moral matters, three of which we will consider. First, religious approaches to morality will not be binding for nonbelievers. These are people who consciously question or reject fundamental points about religion, such as divine revelation, the afterlife, and God’s existence. It is unrealistic to expect them to adopt a religion-based moral system. Nonbelievers might still find some value to religious morality, insofar as the larger message of religion-based ethics is that moral standards are given to us from an authority outside of us individually. Just as children receive their moral notions from their parents, we as adults retain the sense that moral standards come from an authority outside of us. For the nonbeliever this external authority is society and social traditions that extend back thousands of years. Perhaps even divine command theory can be appreciated as a metaphor for this mysterious social tradition of our past that has handed us the brute facts of our current moral codes. Still, nonbelievers cannot be expected to embrace a religious approach to morality, any more than a Christian can be expected to embrace a Hindu, Buddhist or Muslim ethical system.

             Second, in public debates about morality, appeals to religion are often unhelpful. What is important in a successful public debate is to find some neutral ground from which to make one's case, and religion is not neutral. In today’s secular environment, the religious believer limits his audience by appealing to religious intuitions in moral matters. For example, if I debate the issue of women’s rights with a Muslim and he appeals to the Koran to support his perspective, his appeal will carry little weight for me. If you watch news commentators and political pundits who personally believe in God, they usually discipline themselves to avoid talking about God or religion on social policy issues. Instead, they look for other more universal arguments to support their positions. Barak Obama, before he was president, made this point in a speech on the connection between religion and politics:

Democracy demands that the religiously motivated translate their concerns into universal, rather than religion-specific, values. It requires that their proposals be subject to argument, and amenable to reason. I may be opposed to abortion for religious reasons, but if I seek to pass a law banning the practice, I cannot simply point to the teachings of my church or evoke God's will. I have to explain why abortion violates some principle that is accessible to people of all faiths, including those with no faith at all. This is going to be difficult for some who believe in the inerrancy of the Bible, as many evangelicals do. But in a pluralistic democracy, we have no choice. Politics depends on our ability to persuade each other of common aims based on a common reality. ["Address on Faith and Politics," _Sojourners_, June 28, 2006]

The limited role of religion in public discussions on morality rests on a subtle distinction between (1) arguing to justify ones moral view, and (2) arguing to win a debate. Regarding the first point, religious and nonreligious moralists will have their own differing justifications for their moral convictions, and that is unavoidable. What is at issue with public discussions of morality is this second point, that is, how we should best debate the issue in a pluralistic society, and here appeals to more universally accepted moral intuitions is the best practice. In many ways, it is the public discussion of morality that matters most. We all have our own inner lives where we hold to unrealistic hopes and exaggerated fears on any number of personal topics, such as wealth, romance, self-worth, life after death, what it would be like to have super-powers. Speculations about the intangible foundations of morality fall into this category. These issues may be of private importance to us, and we might even find like-minded friends and organizations that share our inner beliefs. But we set these aside when we make contact with people of differing views at work or school, and, in this case, when participating in political discourse to make society a better place.

             Third, believers should consider that there are limits to the authority of religious appeals even for _themselves_. Interpretations of scripture change, religious organizations redefine their doctrines, and individuals’ religious consciences often shift over the years. For example, throughout much of its long history, the Roman Catholic Church held that slavery was morally permissible since it reflected a natural hierarchy in social groups. In more recent times, though, it has condemned slavery. Several centuries ago, the Catholic Church and many early Protestant denominations believed that they were morally justified in torturing and killing vocal members of rival Christian denominations. Today this idea is appalling to all Christian groups. And when contraceptive devices became widely available in the early twentieth century, most Protestant denominations condemned their use since that would thwart God’s plan for human reproduction. Within fifty years, though, most Protestant denominations reversed their views. So, even for the believer, religious assessments of moral matters should be viewed in light of this changing backdrop.

**Summary**

Medieval Christian philosophers hotly debated the relation between morality and God’s will. Intellectualist moral philosophers believed that moral standards are independent of God and that God endorses them because of his rational nature. By contrast, divine command theorists such as Scotus argued that moral standards are created by God and do not exist independently of him. Scotus believed that God has a genuinely free will and absolute power to create anything, so long as it does not involve a logical contradiction. For Scotus, moral principles fall under the domain of God’s absolute power. He offered two arguments for this position. First, he argued that, insofar as religious texts depict God as revoking previously established moral laws, God has creative power over them. However, contrary to Scotus, we’ve also seen that the immoralities of the biblical patriarchs are not clear illustrations of God revoking moral standards. Second, Scotus argued that, insofar as God has absolute power, he has the ability to create moral standards, since doing so would not involve a contraction. The problematic part of this argument is the assumption that God has absolute power.

             There are two common arguments against divine command theory. The first is Bentham’s criticism that it is difficult to clearly identify the will of God. In response, divine command theorists can claim that our knowledge of God’s will is revealed through scripture and personal revelation as interpreted by moral and religious traditions. The second criticism, offered by Leibniz, is that if God creates moral standards, then the notion of divine moral goodness becomes meaningless. That is, the statement “God is morally good” simply means “God does that which he wills.” In response, divine command theorists can argue that this entails a question about whether God practices what he preaches, and that is meaningful to believers who are experiencing tragedy. In conclusion we noted that, although religious-based ethics is currently unpopular in secular discussions of morality, there is nothing wrong with religious morality when believers recognize that there are limits to this approach.

**READING 1: HUME ON SEPARATING MORALITY FROM RELIGION**

_Introduction: David Hume (1711-1776) was one of the first modern philosophers to argue for the separation of ethics from religion. Moral behavior, he argues, is something that we do naturally, automatically and easily, but religion is an artificial set of beliefs and behaviors that have little to do with actual morality. According to Hume, theology “bends every branch of knowledge to its own purpose, without much regard to the phenomena of nature, or to the unbiassed sentiments of the mind.” Because of this, he continues, “reasoning, and even language, have been warped from their natural course, and distinctions have been endeavored to be established where the difference of the objects was, in a manner, imperceptible” (second_ Enquiry_, Appendix 4). The selections below present two of Hume’s against religiously-grounded morality._

**Impossibility of Knowing the Moral Qualities of God**

[Is it not presumptuous to] imagine we comprehend the Deity, and have some adequate idea of his nature and attributes? When I read a volume, I enter into the mind and intention of the author. I become him, in a manner, for the instant, and have an immediate feeling and conception of those ideas which revolved in his imagination while employed in that composition. But so near an approach we never surely can make to the Deity. His ways are not our ways. His attributes are perfect, but incomprehensible. And this volume of nature [i.e., the mind of God] contains a great and inexplicable riddle, more than any intelligible discourse or reasoning.

             The ancient Platonists, you know, were the most religious and devout of all the Pagan philosophers. Yet many of them, particularly Plotinus, expressly declare, that intellect or understanding is not to be ascribed to the Deity; and that our most perfect worship of him consists, not in acts of veneration, reverence, gratitude, or love; but in a certain mysterious self-annihilation, or total extinction of all our faculties. These ideas are, perhaps, too far stretched. But still it must be acknowledged, that, by representing the Deity as so intelligible and comprehensible, and so similar to a human mind, we are guilty of the grossest and most narrow partiality, and make ourselves the model of the whole universe.

             All the sentiments of the human mind—gratitude, resentment, love, friendship, approbation, blame, pity, emulation, envy—have a plain reference to the state and situation of man, and are calculated for preserving the existence and promoting the activity of such a being in such circumstances. It seems, therefore, unreasonable to transfer such sentiments to a supreme existence, or to suppose him actuated by them. And the phenomena besides of the universe will not support us in such a theory. All our ideas, derived from the senses, are confessedly false and illusive, and cannot therefore be supposed to have place in a supreme intelligence. And as the ideas of internal sentiment, added to those of the external senses, compose the whole furniture of human understanding, we may conclude, that none of the materials of thought are in any respect similar in the human and in the divine intelligence. Now, as to the manner of thinking; how can we make any comparison between them, or suppose them any wise resembling? Our thought is fluctuating, uncertain, fleeting, successive, and compounded. And were we to remove these circumstances, we absolutely annihilate its essence, and it would in such a case be an abuse of terms to apply to it the name of thought or reason. At least if it appear more pious and respectful (as it really is) still to retain these terms, when we mention the Supreme Being, we ought to acknowledge, that their meaning, in that case, is totally incomprehensible; and that the infirmities of our nature do not permit us to reach any ideas which in the least correspond to the ineffable sublimity of the Divine attributes.

**Religions seek to Appease God through Superstition, not through Morality**

It is certain, that, in every religion, however sublime the verbal definition which it gives of its divinity, many of the votaries, perhaps the greatest number, will still seek the divine favor, not by virtue and good morals, which alone can be acceptable to a perfect being, but either by frivolous observances, by intemperate zeal, by rapturous ecstasies, or by the belief of mysterious and absurd opinions. The least [or smallest] part of the [Zoroastrian] Sadder, as well as of the [Hebrew] Pentateuch, consists in precepts of morality; and we may also be assured, that that part was always the least observed and regarded. . . .

             Nay, if we should suppose, what never happens, that a popular religion were found, in which it was expressly declared, that nothing but morality could gain the divine favor; if an order of priests were instituted to inculcate this opinion, in daily sermons, and with all the arts of persuasion; yet so inveterate [or ingrained] are the people’s prejudices, that, for want [or lack] of some other superstition, they would make the very [ritualistic] attendance on these sermons the essentials of religion, rather than place them in [the actual content of these sermons concerning] virtue and good morals. . . .

             This observation, then, holds universally. But still one may be at some loss to account for it. It is sufficient to observe, that the people, everywhere, degrade their deities into a similitude [or similarity] with themselves, and consider them merely as a species of human creatures, somewhat more potent and intelligent. This will not remove the difficulty. For there is no man so stupid, as that, judging by his natural reason, he would not esteem virtue and honesty the most valuable qualities, which any person could possess. Why not ascribe the same sentiment to his deity? Why not make all religion, or the chief part of it, to consist in these attainments?

             Nor is it satisfactory to say, that the practice of morality is more difficult than that of superstition; and is therefore rejected. . . .

             Perhaps, the following account may be received as a true solution of the difficulty. The duties, which a man performs as a friend or parent, seem merely owing to his benefactor or children; nor can he be wanting to these duties, without breaking through all the ties of nature and morality. A strong inclination may prompt him to the performance: A sentiment of order and moral obligation joins its force to these natural ties: And the whole man, if truly virtuous, is drawn to his duty, without any effort or endeavor. Even with regard to the virtues, which are more austere, and more founded on reflection, such as public spirit, filial duty, temperance, or integrity; the moral obligation, in our apprehension, removes all pretension to religious merit; and the virtuous conduct is deemed no more than what we owe to society and to ourselves. In all this, a superstitious man finds nothing, which he has properly performed for the sake of this deity, or which can peculiarly recommend him to the divine favor and protection. He considers not, that the most genuine method of serving the divinity is by promoting the happiness of his creatures. He still looks out for some more immediate service of the supreme Being, in order to allay those terrors, with which he is haunted. And any practice, recommended to him, which either serves to no purpose in life, or offers the strongest violence to his natural inclinations; that practice he will the more readily embrace, on account of those very circumstances, which should make him absolutely reject it. It seems the more purely religious, because it proceeds from no mixture of any other motive or consideration. And if, for its sake, he sacrifices much of his ease and quiet, his claim of merit appear still to rise upon him, in proportion to the zeal and devotion which he discovers. In restoring a loan, or paying a debt, his divinity is nowise beholden to him; because these acts of justice are what he was bound to perform, and what many would have performed, were there no god in the universe. But if he fast a day, or give himself a sound whipping; this has a direct reference, in his opinion, to the service of God. No other motive could engage him to such austerities. By these distinguished marks of devotion, he has now acquired the divine favor; and may expect, in recompense, protection and safety in this world, and eternal happiness in the next.

             Hence the greatest crimes have been found, in many instances, compatible with a superstitious piety and devotion: Hence, it is justly regarded as unsafe to draw any certain inference in favor of a man’s morals from the fervor or strictness of his religious exercises, even though he himself believe them sincere. Nay, it has been observed, that enormities of the blackest dye have been rather apt to produce superstitious terrors, and increase the religious passion. . . .

**READING 2: PALEY ON MORALITY GROUNDED IN THE WILL OF GOD**

_Introduction: William Paley argues that grounding morality in religion is not as problematic as Hume maintains. For Paley, we can discover the will of God either through scripture (sometimes called “revealed religion”), or the use of our reason as we examine the divine order within the natural world (sometimes called “natural religion”). An examination of the natural world shows us that God desires human happiness. From this Paley concludes that morality is grounded in God’s will that human’s should be happy, and, accordingly, morally right conduct is that which has the tendency to produce human happiness._

**The Will of God revealed through Scripture and through Reason**

As the will of God is our rule, to inquire what is our duty, or what we are obliged to do, in any instance, is, in effect, to inquire “what is the will of God in that instance?” which consequently becomes the whole business of morality. Now there are two methods of coming at the will of God on any point: (1) by his express declarations, when they are to be had, and which must be sought for in Scripture; (2) by what we can discover of his designs and disposition from his works; or, as we usually call it, the light of nature.

             And here we may observe the absurdity of separating natural and revealed religion from each other [i.e., rational theology from scripture]. The object of both is the same—to discover the will of God—and, provided we do but discover it, it matters nothing by what means. An ambassador, judging by what he knows of his sovereign’s disposition, and arguing from what he has observed of his conduct, or is acquainted with of his designs, may take his measures in many cases with safety, and presume with great probability how his master would have him act on most occasions that arise [i.e., consulting rational religion]. But if he have his commission and instructions in his pocket, it would be strange not to look into them [i.e., consulting scripture]. He will be directed by both rules. When his instructions are clear and positive, there is an end to all further deliberation (unless indeed he suspect their authenticity). Where his instructions are silent or dubious, he will endeavor to supply or explain them, by what he has been able to collect from other quarters of his master’s general inclination or intentions. . . .

             The method of coming at the will of God, concerning any action, by the light of nature [i.e. rational religion], is to inquire into “the tendency of the action to promote or diminish the general happiness.” This rule proceeds upon the presumption, that God Almighty wills and wishes the happiness of his creatures; and, consequently, that those actions, which promote that will and wish, must be agreeable to him; and the contrary.

             As this presumption is the foundation of our whole system, it becomes necessary to explain the reasons upon which it rests.

**God’s Will is the Promotion of Human Happiness**

When God created the human species, either he wished their happiness, or he wished their misery, or he was indifferent and unconcerned about both.

             If he had wished our misery, he might have made sure of his purpose, by forming our senses to be so many sores and pains to us, as they are now instruments of gratification and enjoyment: or by placing us amidst objects so ill-suited to our perceptions, as to have continually offended us, instead of ministering to our refreshment and delight. He might have made, for example, everything we tasted, bitter; everything we saw, loathsome; everything we touched, a sting; every smell a stench; and every sound a discord.

             If he had been indifferent about our happiness or misery, we must impute to our good fortune (as all design by this supposition is excluded) both the capacity of our senses to receive pleasure, and the supply of external objects fitted to produce it. But either of these (and still more both of them) being too much to be attributed to accident, nothing remains but the first supposition, that God, when he created the human species, wished their happiness; and made for them the provision which he has made, with that view, and for that purpose.

             The same argument may be proposed in different terms. Thus: Contrivance proves design: and the predominant tendency of the contrivance indicates the disposition of the designer. The world abounds with contrivances: and all the contrivances which we are acquainted with, are directed to beneficial purposes. Evil, no doubt, exists; but is never, that we can perceive, the object of contrivance. Teeth are contrived to eat, not to ache; their aching now and then, is incidental to the contrivance, perhaps inseparable from it. Or even, if you will, let it be called a defect in the contrivance; but it is not the object of it. This is a distinction which well deserves to be attended to. In describing implements of husbandry, you would hardly say of the sickle, that it is made to cut the reaper’s fingers, though, from the construction of the instrument, and the manner of using it, this mischief often happens. But if you had occasion to describe instruments of torture or execution. This engine, you would say, is to extend the sinews; this to dislocate the joints; this to break the bones; this to scorch the soles of the feet. Here, pain and misery are the very objects of the contrivance. Now, nothing of this sort is to be found in the works of nature. We never discover a train of contrivance to bring about an evil purpose. No anatomist ever discovered a system of organization calculated to produce pain and disease; or, in explaining the parts of the human body, ever said, This is to irritate; this to inflame; this duct is to convey the gravel to the kidneys; this gland to secrete the humor which forms the gout: if by chance he come at a part of which he knows not the use, the most he can say is, that it is useless: no one ever suspects that it is put there to incommode, to annoy, or to torment. Since then God has called forth his consummate wisdom to contrive and provide for our happiness, and the world appears to have been constituted with this design at first; so long as this constitution is upholden by him, we must in reason suppose the same design to continue.

             The contemplation of universal nature rather bewilders the mind than affects it. There is always a bright spot in the prospect, upon which the eye rests; a single example, perhaps, by which each man finds himself more convinced than by all others put together. I seem, for my own part, to see the benevolence of the Deity more clearly in the pleasures of very young children, than in any thing in the world. The pleasures of grown persons may be reckoned partly of their own procuring. [This is] especially if there has been any industry, or contrivance, or pursuit, to come at them; or if they are founded, like music, painting, etc., upon any qualification of their own acquiring. But the pleasures of a healthy infant are so manifestly provided for it by another, and the benevolence of the provision is so unquestionable, that every child I see at its sport, affords to my mind a kind of sensible evidence of the finger of God, and of the disposition which directs it.

             But the example, which strikes each man most strongly, is the true example for him, and hardly two minds hit upon the same; which shows the abundance of such examples about us.

             We conclude, therefore, that God wills and wishes the happiness of his creatures. And this conclusion being once established, we are at liberty to go on with the rule built upon it, namely, “that the method of coming at the will of God, concerning any action, by the light of nature, is to inquire into the tendency of that action to promote or diminish the general happiness.”

**INTRODUCTION**

Anti-government groups in the United States are on the rise. Some are militia organizations that believe an armed populace is an essential safeguard against government tyranny. Others are driven by economic concerns as the national debt increases and the government bails out elite companies. Yet others have an anti-immigrant agenda in response to the increase of non-whites within the population. While their specific agendas may differ, a common theme of the groups is opposition to freedom-restricting activities of the government; some are even preparing for revolution and outright war. The most extreme case of this the destruction a nine-story federal office building in Oklahoma City by a car bomb that killed 168 people, 19 of which were children in a day care center within the structure. The perpetrators belonged to an anti-government militia group that specifically opposed government gun control efforts, and the intended message behind the bombing was that the government should not take away our freedoms.

             One troubling aspect of anti-government groups is its underlying ideological message, part of which we accept as freedom lovers, and part of which we reject for its extremism. According to many anti-government groups, we establish governments to perform only a narrow range of tasks, principally protection from foreign invasion. However, the government pushes its authority beyond its established purpose by unjustly restricting people’s freedoms. This justifies resistance, which even the U.S. Declaration of Independence endorses: “Whenever any form of government becomes destructive to these ends [i.e., rights to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness], it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government.”

             The underlying philosophy of such anti-government groups is that of social contract theory. In its less extreme form, social contract theory is both a legitimate and a historically important account of political and moral obligation. Briefly, social contract theory describes a disease and then proposes a cure. The disease is that humans have unsociable tendencies and are unable to construct and live in cooperative societies. The cure is that we contractually agree to be civil to one another under threat of punishment from a governing body that we establish for this purpose. This mutual contract then becomes the backbone for our moral obligations to each other.

             Social contract theory has a long but spotty history. Plato hints at such a theory in his dialogue _The Republic_. A skeptical character in that work named Glaucon argues that people are naturally inclined to exploit one another. However, since we do not like being exploited, we agree not to exploit others on the condition that others do not exploit us:

When men have both done and suffered injustice and have had experience of both, not being able to avoid the one and obtain the other, they think that they had better agree among themselves to have neither; hence there arise laws and mutual covenants; and that which is ordained by law is termed by them lawful and just. [_Republic_, 2.358e]

For Glaucon, the mutual contracts that we create are the basis of the rules of justice. Plato himself did not accept this skeptical view of the origins of morality; instead, he argued that moral truths are fixed in a higher eternal realm of the universe. For almost 2000 years, most moral philosophers largely agreed with Plato’s view. In particular, they believed that both morality and governmental authority are grounded in objective natural laws that God himself endorses. During the seventeenth century, a few skeptically-minded philosophers offered alternative explanations of morality that were grounded more in the human than the heavenly realm. One of these was English philosopher Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679), who presents the first detailed account of social contract theory. In this chapter we will examine Hobbes’s view and criticisms against it.

**HOBBES’S THEORY**

Hobbes presents his social contract theory in a series of works, the most famous of which is _The Leviathan_ (1651). For Hobbes, the powerful governing body that we establish for protection is like the “Leviathan,” a large mythological sea creature as depicted in the Hebrew Bible and earlier Canaanite mythology. The Hebrew Bible describes the great sea creature as the “king over all the children of pride.” Similarly, Hobbes saw that the government as the king over prideful people, insofar as our human pride forces us to create a government for our own protection.

**The State of Nature**

A common story line in science fiction sagas is that modern society crumbles because of a nuclear world war or a colossal ecological disaster. A few isolated surviving humans forage through the ruins of destroyed cities, hoping to find a stray can of food, a container of gasoline, or a box of bullets. Every contact with another human is a life-or-death struggle to acquire the other person’s goods. Rather than looking into the future to describe a post-apocalyptic world, Hobbes looks to the distant past and asks us to imagine what life might have been like before there were any governing bodies. The condition that Hobbes describes is as brutal as any science fiction story. He calls this primitive condition the state of nature. He is not describing an actual time in human history, but, rather, hopes only to highlight the limits of our human nature and the effects of our unsocial inclinations on our interactions with others.

             Why, though, must the state of nature so unsocial? Just as there are science fiction movies that depict the future as a perfect utopia, we can also envision a more primitive human condition in which people get along with each other perfectly well. The first and overarching reason why people would be so unsociable in the state of nature is because we are selfish, and incurably so. Selfishness is embedded within our emotions and thought processes, and we will always be acting in ways that benefit each of us individually. Even when it seems as though we are acting from motivations of kindness and compassion, beneath the surface we are still thinking about ourselves.

             A second reason for our unsociability is that people are roughly equal to one another in both intellectual cunning and physical strength, and this makes us feel as though we can acquire what we want in life without too much resistance from other people. Intellectually, we all gain knowledge through experience, and, with enough time and effort, we can all rise to a comparable intellectual level. Physically, although a bigger person might be able to beat me in an arm wrestling contest, with a little cunning I can overpower him. Hobbes writes that “as to the strength of body, the weakest has strength enough to kill the strongest, either by secret mechination, or by confederacy with others that are in the same danger with himself.” Although intellectual and physical equality might seem like good things, in the state of nature they only perpetuate struggle. If someone stood out with superhuman physical abilities, such as Superman, then he could simply take control and force people to cooperate. Perhaps the same thing could happen if someone stood out with superhuman intellectual abilities. But since we’re all more or less equal in the state of nature, no one will naturally emerge to take charge.

             A third reason for our unsociability is that we are naturally quarrelsome and always ready for violent confrontation. Hobbes notes three reasons for this as well. First, we equally desire things that are in limited supply. All of us seek after basic necessities such as food, clothing, and shelter. If all of our physical needs in life could be met simply by reaching up and picking things off a tree, then there would be no need to engage in conflict with anyone. The reality of the situation, though, is otherwise. Necessities are in limited supply, and as we compete for the same things, we quickly come to view one another as enemies. Through violence, then, we seek to subdue “men’s persons, wives, children, and cattle.” The second cause of quarrel is that, once we acquire some goods, we immediately become distrustful of people who approach us, and so we attack them. This is not merely paranoia, but a necessary means of protecting things that we’ve acquired. For example, when people win large amounts of money in a lottery, they are often targeted by scam artists who try to defraud them of their winnings with shady investment opportunities. The more distrustful we are of outsiders, the better we’ll be able to retain what we’ve acquired. In the state of nature, this distrust translates inclines us towards violence. The third cause of quarrels is that we will attack others simply to preserve our reputations as tough guys that people should not mess around with. If our reputations diminish, then others will see us as easy prey.

             The consequence of all this is a state of war pitting all against all. It includes actual as well as anticipated wars that, similar to the cold war between the United States and the former Soviet Union, involve constant military posturing. Hobbes’s description of this state of war is one of the most famous passages in philosophy:

In such condition there is no place for industry, because the fruit thereof is uncertain, and consequently, no culture of the earth, no navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea, no commodious building, no instruments of moving and removing such things as require much force, no knowledge of the face of the earth, no account of time, no arts, no letters, no society, and which is worst of all, continual fear and danger of violent death, and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short. [_Leviathan_, 13]

For Hobbes, in the state of nature, we would lack all social comforts that come about through mutual cooperation. We would not even attempt to grow food, import goods, or build dwellings on our own since we would thereby make ourselves targets of attack by other people. Our rivals would see what we have, desire it, and kill us to acquire it. We would have no “knowledge of the face of the earth” since the only geographical area that counts is the one immediately around us as we seek to survive attacks by others. We would have “no account of time” since the only time that matters is the present moment in which we struggle to survive. We would have no arts and no literary compositions since these are luxury items that humans create only after we secure our survival. We would have no society since social interaction requires trust and cooperation, which we would not be capable of. In essence, our human lives would be “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.”

             What kind of morality is there in this state of nature? In a word, none! Hobbes argues that in this condition the “notions of right and wrong, justice and injustice have there no place.” It is a moral free-for-all in which we can do whatever we want, in which “every person has a right to everything, even to one another’s body.” Hobbes offers several examples from ordinary-life situations to support his gloomy description of our amoral human nature. When we go on trips, we take guns with us for protection against robbers. When we go to bed at night, we lock our cabinets to prevent our housekeepers and even our own children from stealing from us. We take these extra steps to protect ourselves in addition to the protection we get from the police and court systems. And individual countries, like individual people, are always poised to defend themselves against invaders who want to plunder their resources. If this is how bad it is right now, think of how much worse it would be within the state of nature without the police, courts, and international laws.

**The Laws of Nature**

The state of nature that Hobbes describes is so disturbing that it gives us strong motivation to want to rise above that condition if possible. None of us wants to die violently; we all want decent living conditions; we also carry hopes that we can improve our living conditions through work. But we cannot fulfill any of these desires until we achieve peace, and Hobbes next describes what we need to do to secure such peace. This part of his discussion is influenced by natural law theory, particularly the version developed by Dutch philosopher Hugo Grotius (1583–1645). In his work _The Law of War and Peace_ (1625), Grotius argues that there are fixed moral laws of nature that are binding on everyone worldwide. Further, according to Grotius, we set up governing bodies to ensure that we follow these moral mandates of natural law and thus live peacefully. Hobbes not only follows Grotius’s basic solution to securing peace but also adopts the language of natural law theory. For Hobbes, then, we get out of the state of nature by following the laws of nature.

             Hobbes lists fifteen distinct laws of nature that facilitate ending conflict and securing peace, the first three of which are the most important. He describes the first law of nature as this:

Every man ought to endeavour peace, as far as he has hope of obtaining it, and when he cannot obtain it, that he may seek and use all helps and advantages of war. [_Leviathan_, 14)]

This first law of nature tells us that we should seek peace but that we should defend ourselves if we cannot achieve it. The binding nature of this law is clear: We all wish to survive, and peace is the best way to do this. When peace fails, however, we need to defend ourselves.

             The second law of nature describes more precisely how we achieve peace with one another. We saw that in the state of nature “Every person has a right to everything, even to one another’s body.” Imagine that each of us carried around a bag with slips of paper that listed all of our respective rights in the state of nature. The rights that I would have in that situation are almost infinite in number and allow me complete liberty. For example, I might pull one slip out of my bag that says I have a right to hop around on one foot. I might pull another slip out that says I have the right to kill you—which surely would worry you. However, in your rights bag, you would have a similar slip of paper that says you have the right to kill me, and that certainly would worry me. And as long as we both hold onto our rights to kill each other, we can never achieve peace.

             The second law of nature, then, says that you and I should agree to give up those specific rights that threaten each of us respectively:

A man [should] be willing, when others are so too, as far-forth as for peace and defence of himself he shall think it necessary, to lay down this right to all things, and be contented with so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself. (_Leviathan_, 14)

According to this law of nature, if you’re willing to remove from your bag the slip of paper that grants you the right to kill me, then I should be willing to remove from my bag the slip of paper that grants me the right to kill you. We should do this with all rights that breed hostility—such as the right to kill, steal from, lie to, or assault others—and enlist any person who is willing to cooperate with us. In short, the second law of nature tells us, “Do not do to others what you would not want done to yourself.” Why should I be willing to give up any of my personal rights? Because my survival depends on it. However, Hobbes implies that we should only mutually give up those rights that are necessary for securing peace. For example, my right to hop around on one foot has no bearing on the peace process, so I should not give up that right.

             The third law of nature is simply that “people perform their covenants made,” since our agreements are empty words if we do not keep them. For Hobbes, even if you and I have the best of intentions and plan on giving up our hostile rights forever, we must actually abstain from those hostilities; otherwise, we will remain in the state of nature. Assuring that we abide by our agreements is tricky. I will always be looking for ways to cheat the system, and I can only assume that you will, too. Our verbal agreement alone is not enough, and we both need some extra motivation to follow through on our agreements. The solution is that we both agree to give unlimited power to a political authority that will punish us if we break our agreements. This means that you and I must give up a few more of our rights, handing them over to this political authority. But it is worth it if this is the only way to guarantee our contractual arrangement, which in turn ends the state of nature.

             Hobbes’s remaining twelve laws of nature are principally rules of diplomacy that preserve peaceful coexistence once it is established. For example, the fourth law tells us that we should show gratitude toward others who comply with contracts. If we do not, then others might regret participating in the contract. The fifth law says that we should compromise on minor issues that serve the larger interests of society. If we have to debate every little issue, then the peace process will grind to a halt.

**Political Theory and Moral Theory**

Hobbes’s social contract theory serves double duty: as (1) a political theory that justifies the existence of a government and (2) a moral theory that specifies our moral obligations. As a political theory, Hobbes’s social contract theory maintains that governments are the creations of people, and not the creations of God. The complete justification for a government’s existence is its role as preserver of the peace. However, even though we are the ones who create governments, we are never allowed to overthrow them once they are established, even if we’re not happy with the job that they’re doing. The reason for this is that, to guarantee that governments will be effective in their peacekeeping mission, we must give them absolute and irrevocable authority over us. For Hobbes, if governments have anything less than this, then they will be unable to enforce the laws.

             The governments that we establish can be monarchies, aristocracies, or democracies. However, Hobbes believed that monarchies are the most effective in preserving the peace, for several reasons. Monarchs will receive better counsel since they can select experts and get advice in private. Monarchs’ policies will also be more consistent since they are operating as individuals, unlike other forms of government that have many leaders. Similarly, there is less chance of a civil war with a monarchy since monarchs will not disagree with themselves.

             As to Hobbes’s moral theory, two features are prominent. First, morality is not a permanent feature of the nature of things, but, instead, is only a creation of the social contract. We saw that, in the state of nature, “Notions of right and wrong, justice and injustice have there no place.” The notions of morality that emerge through the laws of nature are contractual agreements. In this regard, Hobbes is a moral skeptic insofar as he holds that moral principles have no objective foundation independent of human society.

             The second feature of Hobbes’s moral theory is that our specific moral obligations are intimately linked with the fifteen laws of nature. For example, the third law of nature states that we should keep our contracts. When we do this, we have the moral virtue of justice; when we fail to do this, we have the moral vice of injustice. Similarly, the fourth law of nature states that we should show gratitude toward those who keep their contracts. When we follow this fourth law, we have the virtue of gratitude; when we fail to do so, we have the vice of ingratitude. Other virtues that Hobbes lists include sociability, modesty, equity, and mercy, with each linked directly to one of the fifteen laws of nature. Hobbes also notes that his theory recognizes the same virtues as traditional virtue theories, such as Aristotle’s, which includes courage and fortitude. So, Hobbes writes that “the science of virtue and vice is moral philosophy, and therefore the true doctrine of the Laws of Nature is the true moral philosophy.” There are two specific implications to Hobbes’s virtue account of morality. First, the job of moral philosophy is to find out specifically which virtuous character traits facilitate adherence to the various laws of nature. Second, our job as morally responsible people is to cultivate virtuous character traits since, if we do not, we place the peace of society at risk.

             To summarize, here are the main points of Hobbes’s theory:

• The prepolitical state of nature for humans is a condition of mutual conflict that contains no objective moral values.

• We achieve peace by mutually agreeing to give up our rights to harm one another.

• To ensure compliance, we create governments that punish those who break the agreements.

• To further secure compliance we recognize various laws of nature and acquire moral virtues.

**CRITICISMS OF HOBBES**

For decades after his death, Hobbes was the principal target of criticism among moral and political philosophers, and dozens of negative reactions were published that criticized almost every part of his theory. We will look at three attacks that are directed at central features of his moral theory.

**Hyde’s Criticism: Hobbes Denies That Morality Is Immutable and Eternal**

We saw that, for Hobbes, traditional moral values are nonexistent in the state of nature, and morality is a creation of the social contract. But while boldly denying morality in the natural condition, he fudges the issue a little when describing the invented status of morality within the social contract. In fact, he goes so far as to say that “the Laws of Nature are immutable and eternal.” Traditionally, when philosophers such as Grotius claimed that morality is “eternal” and “immutable,” they meant that moral values are universal and unchanging, and are not creations of human convention. Hobbes’s choice of the words “immutable” and “eternal” was probably politically motivated, representing an attempt to avoid condemnation by conservative critics. If so, his ruse was not successful. Edward Hyde (1609–1674), a British politician and acquaintance of Hobbes, charged that Hobbes’s laws of nature are not at all “immutable” and “eternal” in the usual philosophical sense:

If nature has thus providently provided for the peace and tranquillity of her children, by laws immutable and eternal that are written in their hearts, how come they to fall into that condition of war, as to be every one against every one, and to be without any other cardinal virtues, but of force and fraud? [_A Survey of Mr. Hobbes_ (1676)]

According to Hyde, even the content of Hobbes’s laws of nature reveal that they are not immutable and eternal in the traditional sense:

But where are those maxims to be found—which Mr. Hobbes declares and publishes to be the laws of nature—in any other author before him? That is only properly called “the law of nature” [when] that is dictated to the whole species [ibid]

Hyde has two complaints against Hobbes. First, he accuses Hobbes of actually denying the immutable and eternal nature of morality, as seen in Hobbes’s depiction of the state of nature. Second, he claims that Hobbes tries to intentionally misdirect us by describing the laws of nature as immutable and eternal when Hobbes clearly does not mean it. Hobbes must plead guilty to both of these charges. However, from today’s perspective, neither of these crimes are as bad as Hyde makes them out to be. As to Hyde’s first charge, philosophers today typically do not describe moral principles as “immutable” and “eternal.” To do so requires that we postulate some eternal realm in which moral principles permanently exist—a realm completely outside of human society. This calls for more metaphysical speculation than philosophers today are comfortable with.

             As to Hyde’s second complaint, even intentionally misdirecting us on key terminology is defensible. Between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries, philosophers, theologians, and scientists could be imprisoned, tortured, and even executed for publishing controversial ideas. The most famous example of this is the case of Italian astronomer Galileo (1564–1642), who, under threat of torture, retracted his claim about a sun-centered solar system. Sometimes, controversial authors could appease religious and political authorities simply by being diplomatic in their choice of words. Hobbes was concerned about negative reactions from the authorities, and it is reasonable to interpret his choice of the terms “immutable” and “eternal” as an act of diplomacy.

             We can also see Hobbes’s choice of these words as an attempt to reformulate the traditional moral vocabulary. Like astronomers and other scientists of his time, Hobbes hoped to break from medieval traditions and set his area of inquiry on a new and more scientifically rigorous course. The context of Hobbes’s comments about the immutable and eternal nature of morality shows how he tried to redirect discussions on the nature of morality:

The Laws of Nature are immutable and eternal. For injustice, ingratitude, arrogance, pride, iniquity, acception of persons, and the rest, can never be made lawful. For it can never be that war shall preserve life, and peace destroy it. [_Leviathan_, 15]

Hobbes argues here that the laws of nature are “immutable and eternal” to the extent that they are required for preserving life through making peace. Hobbes, then, shifts the discussion of moral truths from a mysterious eternal realm to the observable realm of human nature and our desire for survival. In the end, the history of philosophy shows that the terms “immutable” and “eternal” did not take to being redefined and simply were dropped. But Hobbes did the best he could when working with the terminology of his day.

**Clarke’s Criticism: Punishment Alone will not Motivate Us to Always Keep Contracts**

Suppose that I agree to participate in the social contract. Although I understand that I’m supposed to keep the agreements that I’ve made, I occasionally see potential opportunities to violate these agreements when it might benefit me. For example, while my neighbor is not looking, I could sneak next door, steal his lawnmower, and sell it to a pawnshop. If I’m careful, I will not get caught. So what should stop me from violating the social contract if I can get away with it?

             British philosopher Samuel Clarke (1675–1729) draws attention to this problem and argues that ultimately Hobbes’s theory offers no safeguard to ensure that we will keep our agreements in such situations:

If the rules of right and wrong, just and unjust, have none of them any obligatory force in the state of nature, antecedent to positive compact, then, for the same reason, neither will they be of any force after the compact, so as to afford men any certain and real security; (excepting only what may arise from the compulsion of laws, and fear of punishment, which therefore, it may well be supposed, is all that Mr. Hobbes really means at the bottom.) [_Discourse_, 1]

Clarke argues here that, if we are not motivated to follow moral rules in the state of nature, then we will not be any more motivated to follow moral rules once we enter into the social contract. Clarke recognizes that fear of punishment may provide some motivation to follow the rules, but he claims that this is not enough. For Clarke, our main motivation to follow moral rules comes directly from an awareness of eternal and immutable moral truths themselves—and Hobbes denies this as a source of moral obligation. In short, according to Clarke, fear of punishment is the only source of motivation that Hobbes provides, and that is not sufficient to motivate us to always keep our agreements.

             Hobbes addresses this issue himself, agreeing that someone might reason as follows: “There is no such thing as justice . . . [and that for someone] to make or not make, keep or not keep, covenants was not against reason, when it conduced to one’s benefit.” Take, for example, someone that we can call a _sneaky contract breaker_. He knows the terms of the social contract, and verbally agrees to them, but thinks he’s clever enough to break the rules without getting caught.  However, Hobbes suggests that this line of reasoning is flawed:

He, therefore, that breaketh his covenant, and consequently declareth that he thinks he may with reason do so, cannot be received into any society that unite themselves for peace and defense but by the error of them that receive him; nor when he is received, be retained in it without seeing the danger of their error; which errors a man cannot reasonably reckon upon as the means of his security. . . [_Leviathan_, 15]

In other words, according to Hobbes, it is not reasonable for the sneaky contract breaker to base his own security entirely on his ability to go undetected. If he is caught, then he will be expelled from society, and, it is just not reasonable for him to take this risk. So, for Hobbes, fear of punishment is sufficient to restrain the sneaky contract breaker.

             Hobbes is probably right that we will not take the risk if there is a good chance that we’d be detected. But what if I plan the perfect crime, with no reasonable chance of getting caught? That is, what if I am an _extra-cautious contract breaker_? In this case, Hobbes needs another source of moral obligation that goes beyond an immediate fear of punishment. Perhaps we can rescue Hobbes from this dilemma by drawing on the virtue component of his theory. Suppose that I carefully scheme to steal my neighbor’s lawn-mower, and I succeed without getting caught. As a creature of habit, I am likely to plan similar crimes against other neighbors, and each time I do I increase the risk of being detected. By starting down the initial path of theft, then, I am taking an unreasonable risk since the odds of my getting caught are increased with each new act of theft. To eliminate this risk, the reasonable thing for me to do is develop the virtue of justice so that I will habitually avoid stealing and never even start down that perilous path. So, when I recognize my tendency to fall into dangerous habits, my fear of punishment should motivate me to develop consistent virtues, which in turn will keep me from breaking the rules. Hobbes’s actual comments on the role of virtues are brief, and he does not offer this specific solution there. However, in view of Hobbes’s position that “the science of virtue and vice is moral philosophy,” this virtue-based solution fits neatly into his overall theory. In short, contrary to Clarke, fear of punishment, along with this virtue of justice, may be enough to keep us from breaking contracts, even though we can get away with it.

**Hume’s Criticism: We Do not Even Tacitly Agree to a Social Contract**

Hobbes did not believe that there was an actual point in history when people got together and signed a social contract. However, if the social contract is not a specific historical agreement, then serious questions are raised about what kind of agreement it actually is and how it forms the basis of morality and governance. Hobbes himself tries to address this problem, noting that we can agree to contracts in either of two ways. First, we may agree through a concrete verbal expression, such as “I hereby agree to abide by the terms of the contract.” Second, we may indicate agreement by inference, whereby, through either our silence or actions, others will understand that we’ve agreed to something. Social contract theorists after Hobbes emphasized this second method, which they dubbed tacit consent. Locke provided the definitive description of what counts as tacit consent:

Every man, that hath any possession, or enjoyment, of any part of the dominions of any government, doth thereby give his tacit consent, and is as far forth obliged to obedience to the laws of that government, during such enjoyment, as any one under it. . . [_Two Treatises of Government_ (1690), 2.119]

Thus, according to Locke, if I obtain any possession or benefit from a government, then I’ve tacitly agreed to abide by the rules of that government. For example, if I rely on protection from the local police or the U.S. military, then I’m receiving a benefit from these government agencies and thereby tacitly agree to their rules.

             Scottish philosopher David Hume (1711–1776) was not satisfied with this notion of tacit agreement. According to Hume, willful consent is the key element in any agreement—including tacit agreements—and virtually no one has willfully consented to the authority of their governments:

A tacit promise is, where the will is signified by other more diffuse signs than those of speech; but a will there must certainly be in the case, and that can never escape the person’s notice who exerted it, however silent or tacit. But were you to ask the far greatest part of the nation, whether they had ever consented to the authority of their rulers, or promised to obey them, they would be inclined to think very strangely of you: and would certainly reply, that the affair depended not on their consent, but that they were born to such an obedience. [_Treatise of Human Nature_ (1739–40), 3.2.8]

Hume argues that most people believe they were simply born into a condition of obedience. In fact, according to Hume, based on the idea of a line of succession, politicians try hard to trick people into believing that governments have natural authority over their citizens. Our current rulers claim that many years ago an earlier generation of citizens tacitly consented to a specific government, and governments today inherit that authority over us. Since we cannot go back in time and interview that first generation of citizens, we accept the politicians’ story and see ourselves as born into a condition of obedience. In short, we are tricked into accepting governmental authority, and neither we nor earlier generations of citizens ever tacitly agreed to a social contract. Ironically, Hume feels that this deception is actually a good thing. We need governments for our own protection, and if governments are forced into tricking us into accepting their authority, then so be it. The fact remains, though, that there neither is nor ever was a valid social contract that people tacitly consented to.

             Hume is correct that people do not willfully consent to the terms of a social contract—either explicitly or tacitly. Critics after Hume recognized this problem, and British political philosopher William Godwin (1736–1836) highlights a range of related conceptual problems with terms of the social contract:

Upon the first statement of the system of a social contract various difficulties present themselves. Who are the parties to this contract? For whom did they consent, for themselves only, or for others? For how long a time is this contract to be considered as binding? If the consent of every individual be necessary, in what manner is that consent to be given? Is it to be tacit, or declared in express terms? [_Enquiry Concerning Political Justice_ (1793), 3.2]

According to Godwin, not only is there a problem with whether the contract is tacit or explicit, but there are also questions about who is involved in the contract, how long the contract is binding, and what the precise terms of the contract are. Suppose that a defender of Hobbes concedes all of these problems and grants that there is no _actual_ contract in place. Instead, according to the defender, the contract is only _hypothetical_. That is, we are only considering how a rational person would respond _if_ that person were placed in the state of nature and presented with a social contract agreement.

             However, appealing to hypothetical contracts leads to yet another problem. It does not make sense to say that _I_ specifically am obligated to the terms of a social contract simply because some imaginary rational person would agree to those terms. We do not convict real people for crimes that imaginary people commit. We do not reward real people for heroic deeds that imaginary people perform. Why, then, should real people be contractually bound by an agreement made by an imaginary person? We simply are not. In short, we must reject the idea of an actual social contract that we supposedly agree to tacitly. We must also reject the idea of a hypothetical social contract that an imaginary person agrees to. We will return the issue of willful consent at the close of this chapter.

**Regan’s Criticism: Social Contract Excludes Animals and Non-Rational Humans**

The social contract is like a moral club. Those who join are entitled to moral consideration and are under the umbrella of governmental protection. Those who do not join are essentially in the state of nature and have no moral consideration. One requirement for joining the club is that implicit signers of the contract must be rational and understand the terms of the contract. Unfortunately, animals do not pass this requirement:

To make covenants with brute beasts is impossible, because not understanding our speech, they understand not, nor accept of any translation of right, nor can translate any right to another. And without mutual acceptation, there is no covenant. [_Leviathan_, 14]

Contemporary philosopher Tom Regan (b. 1938) sees this as a big problem with Hobbes’s version of social contract theory: “As for animals, since they cannot understand contracts, they obviously cannot sign; and since they cannot sign, they have no rights” (“The Case for Animal Rights,” 1985). Although many animals experience pain, are aware of their surroundings, and are even aware of their own identities, the narrow requirements of the social contract exclude them from direct consideration. As members of the moral club we might agree to _some_ set of rules that addresses the issue of animals. For example, we can agree that if I own a dog, you cannot harm my dog any more than you can damage my car. Both my dog and my car are my _property_ and my property is protected under the social contract. Similarly, we may also decide to prohibit torturing even stray or wild animals. If I’m allowed to torture strays just for fun, then I may be more inclined to torture people just for fun. To keep me from developing hostile tendencies toward humans who are club members, we may be willing to adopt a rule against torturing stray animals.

             However, neither of these rules about animals take animals’ interests into account directly. Animals count only to the extent that human club members have a personal interest in them. This exclusivity problem with social contract theory involves more than just animals. Even nonrational _human_ members – such as infants and the mentally impaired—will not get direct moral consideration. Like animals, these beings are also incapable of rationally understanding the terms of the contract. It seems, then, that there are two levels of morality in social contract theory: (1) a higher level in which rationally consenting members have direct moral consideration, and (2) a lower level in which nonrational beings get only indirect consideration.

             In response, the situation for nonrational beings such as animals and infants is not as discriminatory as Regan maintains. Even rationally consenting club members get only indirect moral consideration. I do not show you moral consideration because you directly deserve it as a valuable person; I give you moral consideration only so that I myself can survive. Your moral wellbeing, then, is secondary and dependent upon the value that I place in my own survival. To be precise, social contract theory implies that there are _three_ distinct levels of moral consideration: (1) a primary level of consideration that I give myself, (2) a secondary level that I give to signers of the contract, and (3) a tertiary level that we agree to for animals and babies. If we are willing to accept the secondary moral status of fellow humans, it is not much more of a stretch to accept the tertiary moral status of nonrational beings. It might still seem unfair that nonrational beings must rely on the preferences of rational club members in order to gain even tertiary moral consideration. However, animals and infants are not the kinds of beings that can speak on their own behalf. In _any_ moral theory they require proxy spokespeople to assert their rights, and in _any_ moral theory this will depend on how the spokespeople prefer to value animals and infants.

**SOCIAL CONTRACT THEORY AFTER HOBBES**

Shortly after Hobbes’s writings appeared, theologically-minded critics attacked Hobbes for eliminating God’s role in mandating morality and establishing political authority. Accusations of atheism and irreligion were common, and several religious leaders reportedly even discussed burning Hobbes to death. Fortunately for Hobbes, threats like this never materialized. In spite of these harsh reactions, Hobbes’s general notion of the social contract captured the imagination of philosophers after him, and for 150 years, social contract theory was a dominant theme among political philosophers.

**Seventeenth and Eighteenth Century Theories**

During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries**,** social contract theorists modified features of Hobbes’s theory to make it less skeptical, but they all accepted the basic concept of an original state of nature, and a social contract that addresses limitations of our natural state. For example, German philosopher Samuel von Pufendorf (1632–1694) agreed with Hobbes that the state of nature is fairly miserable and that, to survive, we enter into a social contract and establish political authorities to punish contract violators. However, Pufendorf argued that God sets the basic terms of the social contract by mandating that we should be sociable. For Pufendorf, then, the social contract is grounded in God’s authority, and not simply in the authority of people.

             British philosopher John Locke (1632–1704) also put a more positive spin on social contract theory. According to Locke, the state of nature is not a condition of moral anarchy as Hobbes supposed; instead, it is an environment in which we have God-given natural rights to life, health, liberty, and possessions. Locke agreed that we need to contractually form governments to punish rights violators. However, whereas Hobbes believed that governments should have absolute authority once we put them in place and political revolutions are never justifiable, Locke argued that citizens may overthrow their government if it fails at its peacekeeping role. So, in Locke’s version of social contract theory, political revolutions are sometimes justifiable. The British Whig party quickly adopted Locke’s version of social contract theory to justify the Glorious Revolution of 1688, which resulted in the overthrow of England’s king. This, in turn, provided the intellectual climate to justify the American Revolution and the rights expressed in the Declaration of Independence.

             As in Great Britain, social contract theory played a vital role in 18th-century French political thought, especially in the writings of French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778). Contrary to Hobbes, who described the state of nature as a condition of mutual conflict, Rousseau argued that it is a condition of individual freedom in which creativity flourishes. According to Rousseau, in this state of nature people cannot avoid interacting with one another, and so citizens set up a social contract to regulate this interaction. The contract specifically establishes an absolute democracy that is ruled by the general will of the people, which, for Rousseau, involves what is best for all people. Just as social contract theory offered a philosophical justification for revolutionary activity in Great Britain, it similarly offered justification for the French Revolution of 1789.

             Serious interest in social contract theory declined during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, as an ever-growing number of political philosophers questioned speculations about the state of nature and the very concept of a social contract. In recent decades, though, scholars have turned again to this theory, particularly Hobbes’s version. Contemporary discussions usually expand on three central aspects of the social contract. First, there is a description of a hypothetical environment in which we interact. This involves an account of the limits of our human rationality, the levels of risk that we take in making decisions, the way we balance our short-term versus long-term interests, the extent to which we are self-regarding versus other-regarding, and the degree to which we are physically and mentally equal. Second, in view of this hypothetical environment, there is a description of conflicts that inevitably arise. According to one explanation, our emotions drive us to act selfishly, in ways that conflict with other people’s interests. According to another explanation, conflicts arise based on how we rationally calculate what is in our respective best interests. Third, in view of the inevitable conflicts, there is a description of the type of political authority that is reasonable for us to create.

**The Prisoner’s Dilemma**

One of the best-known contemporary discussions of social contract theory is the prisoner’s dilemma, which describes how conflicts inevitably arise in a hypothetical state of nature. Specifically, the prisoner’s dilemma clarifies how our rational calculations lead to conflict. Imagine that you and I are caught robbing a bank, but the district attorney does not have quite enough evidence to guarantee a conviction. He needs us to confess to our crime, so, using a common interrogation tactic, he puts us in separate rooms and tries to get each of us to turn on the other. In this case, he offers a plea bargain based on various confessions that we might make:

• If I confess and you do not, then I will get only a 3-month sentence, but you will get a 10-year sentence.

• If you confess and I do not, then you will only get a 3-month sentence, but I will get a 10-year sentence.

• If neither of us confesses, then we will both get a 1-year sentence.

• If both of us confess, then we will both get an 8-year sentence.

If you and I could communicate, then the best arrangement would be for both of us to not confess, since then we’d each get only a 1-year sentence. However, since we cannot communicate, I cannot trust that you’ll keep your mouth shut. Even if you and I are friends, I need to calculate what the best deal is for me, regardless of how you respond to the district attorney’s offer. So, in spite of what you decide to do, I’ll clearly be better off by confessing, since it is better to serve 3 months or even 8 years than it is to serve 10 years.

             The point of this illustration is that, although mutual cooperation is the best mutual deal, I will still be rationally motivated to pursue the best deal for me individually. That is, since I cannot trust your decision, I have to look out for my own interests and do what’s best for me. In Hobbes’s terminology, since I cannot trust you in the state of nature, then I’ll have to look out for my own interests and attack you before you attack me. If I eliminate you first, then I serve my interests better than if I sat around passively. Ultimately, cooperation in the state of nature is not reasonable for any of us individually, and we will always be poised for war.

             The original prisoner’s dilemma scenario rests on the assumption that I cannot communicate with you about devising the best mutual strategy to shorten our stays in jail. The parallel in Hobbes’s state of nature is the assumption that I cannot trust you even if you say that you will not attack me. Is this distrust justified? My reasons for distrust in the state of nature rest on a variety of intricate questions about human nature—specifically, whether we can be naturally kind to strangers. Hobbes believed that we are not psychologically designed to be naturally kind to people whom we do not know. If we agree with Hobbes’s pessimistic view about human kindness, then we are justified in distrusting all strangers in the state of nature in spite of the good intentions that they express. However, this pessimistic view is a matter of debate; in fact, this is among the more hotly debated issues in ethics. The best we can say is that, if the pessimists are correct, then—as the prisoner’s dilemma suggests—the state of nature will be a perpetual state of conflict.

**Rawls and Social Contract Theory**

The most influential contemporary proponent of social contract theory is John Rawls, as he develops it in his book _A Theory of Justice_ (1971). Paralleling Hobbes’s state of nature, Rawls describes a hypothetical situation that he calls the original position. In the original position, we are neither at war with one another nor trying to start a government. Instead, we are merely a group of rational, equal, and self-interested people who want to devise mutually beneficial moral guidelines for reforming our social system. To help us arrive at the most impartial moral guideline, we temporarily ignore our actual status in society, such as the size of our bank accounts and the amount of property that we own. Metaphorically, it is as though we voluntarily stand behind a veil of ignorance. This assures that I will not try to rig the system and create moral guidelines that benefit me the most—whether I am rich or poor.

             According to Rawls, after some back-and-forth discussion, we will eventually arrive at two rules of justice. We will then use these two rules to generate a longer and more specific list of obligations. The two rules of justice are these:

• Each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive basic liberty compatible with a similar liberty for others.

• Social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are both (1) reasonably expected to be to everyone’s advantage and (2) attached to positions and offices open to all.

The first rule tells us that we should give one another as much freedom as we can. This includes moral liberties such as free speech and free movement. It also includes economic liberties, such as acquiring property and making money. Finally, it includes political liberties, such as voting and holding public office.

             So far, none of this is controversial from the standpoint of American society, which was founded on broad notions of liberty. However, we sometimes need to place limits on the wealth and power that we individually accumulate from our various liberties. Economic liberty is nice, but when we look at the vast fortunes accumulated by entrepreneurs like Bill Gates, we might feel that enough is enough.

             The second rule is a guideline for regulating the accumulation of wealth and power. According to this rule, Bill Gates can have an unequal amount of money only if such a capitalist economic system is to _everyone’s advantage_ —including poor people. This aspect of Rawls’s theory is controversial. The default economic arrangement is that Bill Gates should get only an _equal_ share of wealth. The burden of proof, then, is on the capitalist businessperson to show that even poor people benefit when an entrepreneur can pursue his economic dreams unimpeded. This, though, is a tough case to support, which makes socialism the default economic policy. Rawls clearly thinks that this socialistic orientation is the most impartial way to distribute wealth. However, capitalists would reject Rawls’s second rule of justice as too biased toward socialism.

**LINGERING PROBLEMS WITH SOCIAL CONTRACT THEORY**

Since the seventeenth century, social contract theory has been a useful tool for justifying political revolutions when governments fail to do their jobs. In the years ahead, political revolutionaries will likely continue to draw on social contract theory to justify overthrowing incompetent governments. Social contract theory also helps us understand why we allow our governments to have so much control over our lives. Take, for example, the power that we give our local police officers. We permit them to walk around with guns and even shoot us if necessary. We give them the authority to kick down our doors, storm through our homes, haul us to jail, and interrogate us for hours. Why would we want to give someone this kind of power over us? Social contract theory offers the best, and perhaps only reasonable, answer: We give the police this power in exchange for protection. In spite of social contract theory’s strong points, there are two lingering problems to the social contract tradition, in many of its forms.

**Mixing Moral Theory with Political Theory**

The first problem with social contract theory is that it does not adequately account for moral obligations that go beyond our political obligations. Social contract theories commonly weave together issues of political authority and moral obligation. Hobbes, for example, believed that we have no moral duties outside of the social contract, and morality emerges as a tool for preserving a peaceful society under the absolute authority of a ruler. From one perspective, this is an advantage of social contract theory since it reduces the conceptual clutter of two separate theories explaining our distinct moral and political obligations. Moral theories and political theories both talk about the behavioral obligations that we have to our fellow humans, and it makes sense to connect these obligations. From another perspective, though, the close relationship between political theory and moral theory is a liability of social contract theory, since it gives too much weight to political obligations. Issues of political authority and political obligation are undoubtedly important for us, and, if we simply ignore the government, we might do things send us to prison. However, political issues are not the only important issues in our lives, and for many of us, they are not even among our most important issues. Moral issues permeate our lives, and every encounter we have with other people involves a proper and an improper way of behaving. Although some of these obligations have direct ties to political issues, many have only a very remote connection.

             Suppose, for example, that you cheat on your spouse and continually lie to your family and friends concerning your secret life. Suppose also that you wipe out your family bank account on personal pleasures and that, when you’re home, you are drunk most of the time. Although all of these actions are immoral, they do not violate any laws, and they pose no threat to political authorities and the continuation of a peaceful political society. So, issues of political obligation only go so far in defining the scope of our moral obligations. The Oklahoma City bombing illustrates this point, too. Most of us feel that the bombers were grossly misdirected in their belief that the U.S. government unjustly overstepped its authority. For the sake of argument, though, let’s concede their bizarre political point and grant that the U.S. government forfeited its status as a legitimate authority. Does this make the bombing any less of an immoral deed? Certainly not. Completely apart from the political issue, there remains the moral issue concerning the value of the 168 victims’ lives, which the bombers callously ignored.

**Social Contract versus Social Reciprocation**

The second lingering problem with social contract theory is that it is naive to take the notion of a contract literally. We noted in our discussion of Hume’s criticism that a literal social contract requires consciously willful consent, and in point of fact, no one really gives this kind of consent to social contracts. Even Rawls’s theory suffers from this problem. When people negotiate the rules of justice, they willfully consent to step behind the veil of ignorance. In reality, though, neither we nor our legislators do this. We may not even be psychologically _capable_ of doing this.

             Although we may not be able to fully rescue social contract theory from this problem, we might recast the theory in a more modest form as a theory of _social reciprocation_. That is, instead of seeing our situation as involving a formal contract that we consciously consent to, it is more plausible to see it simply as a kind of social reciprocation that we are content with. We pay our taxes, follow the laws, and acknowledge the authority of our government; what do we get in return? We receive governmental protection and some governmental benefits, such as free education and the use of public highways. Most of us are content with this give-and-take relationship, and we may not really care about who established the relationship to begin with. We’re happy to leave that issue to the historians. From our individual perspectives, we do not object to keeping the social relationship going, and many of us are even grateful for this relationship when we consider the horrible alternatives that we find in war-torn countries around the world. For example, without strong governmental protection, members of ethnic or religious factions might rise up and slaughter each other. To the extent that we are content with this reciprocal relationship, we will routinely follow the rules of the relationship to keep the social machine working.

             The key difference between a social contract and social reciprocation is that a contract involves a distinct mental act of consent that occurs at a distinct time. Philosophers today refer to this kind of psychological act as an occurrent mental state, which means that it principally occurs during a short and fixed period of time. By contrast, a merely reciprocal relationship requires only a long-term mental viewpoint of contentment. We might compare this mental viewpoint to the outlook of someone who is persistently happy. Suppose, for example, that you are a persistently happy person, and I ask you when you first became happy. You answer, “As far as I know I’ve _always_ been happy, and I do not remember any distinct point in time when I was not.” Philosophers today refer to this as a _dispositional_ mental state insofar as it is long-term and persistent within a person’s mind. Such is the case concerning our mental contentment with the give-and-take relationship between ourselves and society. Insofar as we’ve been consistently content with this reciprocal relationship, then we will follow the required rules.

             Traditional social contract theorists might object that mere contentment is not strong enough to assure that we consistently abide by society’s rules. Even if I am content today, I may become discontent a week from now and then stop following the rules. Granted, the words “contract” and “consent” are much stronger than the words “reciprocation” and “contentment.” However, peppering our moral vocabulary with these stronger words will not necessarily make us take our social obligations more seriously. The Oklahoma City bombing is a good illustration of this. A traditional social contract theorist would say that earlier in their lives the bombers tacitly consented to the terms of the contract, but later in life they both violated those terms. In spite of the weighty implications of the word “contract,” the bombers nevertheless did not take their moral obligation seriously. A less cumbersome explanation would be that, early in life, the bombers were dispositionally content with the give-and-take relationship between themselves and society. Later, though, they became dispositionally discontent and no longer felt compelled to continue the relationship or to abide by the rules.

**SUMMARY**

Thomas Hobbes presented the first systematic account of social contract theory. According to Hobbes, our human nature prevents us from naturally living at peace with one another. Hobbes depicts this by describing a pre-political state of nature in which people constantly war. To move beyond this state of nature, we recognize the need to seek peace, the need to give up our hostile rights, and the need to keep our agreements. Accordingly, we enter into a social contract with one another and establish a government with absolute authority over us to assure that we abide by our agreements. Morality, for Hobbes, involves acquiring virtues that habitually incline us to do what the terms of the social contract require of us.

             Edward Hyde criticized Hobbes for denying the immutable and eternal status of morality. But contemporary moral philosophers have abandoned the specific concepts of immutability and eternality because of the metaphysical difficulties that they create. Samuel Clarke criticized Hobbes for thinking that fear of punishment would sufficiently motivate people to follow the rules of the social contract. If we plan a perfect crime and face no risk of getting caught, then fear of punishment alone will fail as a motivation. As creatures of habit, we are inclined to repeat crimes, and this continually increases our chances of getting caught and punished. To eliminate all risk, we should develop virtues that habitually incline us to follow the rules in all situations. Hume criticized social contract theory on the grounds that people do not willfully consent to the terms of the contract; and, without willful consent, there is no contract. Social contract theorists cannot rescue themselves by claiming that the contract is only hypothetical.

             Many recent discussions of social contract theory draw on the scenario of the prisoner’s dilemma, which helps explain why people are so uncooperative in the state of nature. But the prisoner’s dilemma works as an explanation only if we grant that people are not naturally kind to strangers. Rawls offers a contemporary version of social contract theory, which involves a group of rational people devising rules of justice in an original position. Rawls’s theory is controversial since it leans towards socialism.

             There are two lingering problems with social contract theory. First, we should recognize that social contract theory does not adequately account for moral obligations that rise above our politically-based obligations. Second, we must abandon the idea of a contract involving an occurrent mental state of willful consent. Instead, we should see the relationship as involving a dispositional mental state of contentment. More precisely, we are simply content to have a reciprocal relationship with governing bodies whereby we follow rules in exchange for protection and benefits.

**READING 1: HOBBES ON THE SOCIAL CONTRACT**

**State of War**

Hereby it is manifest, that during the time men live without a common power to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called war. And such a war as is of every man against every man. For war consists not in battle only, or the act of fighting, but [also] in a tract of time, wherein the will to contend by battle is sufficiently known. And, therefore, the notion of time is to be considered in the nature of war, as it is in the nature of weather. For as the nature of foul weather lies not in a shower or two of rain, but in an inclination thereto of many days together; so the nature of war consists not in actual fighting, but in the known disposition thereto, during all the time there is no assurance to the contrary. All other time is peace.

             Whatever therefore is consequent to a time of war, where every man is enemy to every man, the same is consequent to the time wherein men live without other security, than what their own strength and their own invention shall furnish them withal. In such condition, there is no place for industry, because the fruit thereof is uncertain; and consequently no culture of the earth, no navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by sea; no commodious building, no instruments of moving and removing such things as require much force; no knowledge of the face of the earth, no account of time, no arts, no letters, no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.

**Proof of the Natural Condition**

It may seem strange to some man, that has not well weighed these things, that nature should thus dissociate, and render men apt to invade and destroy each other. And he may therefore (not trusting to this inference made from the passions) desire perhaps to have the same confirmed by experience. Let him therefore consider with himself [that], when taking a journey, he arms himself and seeks to go well accompanied. When going to sleep, he locks his doors. When even in his house, he locks his chests, and this when he knows there be laws and public officers armed, to revenge all injuries [which] shall be done [to] him. [Consider] what opinion he has of his fellow subjects when he rides armed; of his fellow citizens when he locks his doors; and of his children and servants when he locks his chests. Does he not there as much accuse mankind by his actions as I do by my words? But neither of us accuse man’s nature in it. The desires, and other passions of man, are in themselves no sin. No more are the actions, that proceed from those passions, till they know a law that forbids them; which till laws be made they cannot know, nor can any law be made till they have agreed upon the person that shall make it.

             It may perhaps be thought [that] there was never such a time nor condition of war as this, and I believe it was never generally so over all the world. But there are many places where they live so now. For the savage people in many places of America (except the government of small families the harmony whereof depends on natural lust) have no government at all and live at this day in that brutish manner, as I said before. However, it may be perceived what manner of life there would be, where there were no common power to fear; [and] by what manner of life, which men that have formerly lived under a peaceful government, . . . [would] degenerate into in a civil war.

             But though there had never been anytime wherein particular men were in a condition of war one against another; yet in all times, kings and persons of sovereign authority (because of their independence) are in continual jealousies and in the state and posture of gladiators, having their weapons pointing and their eyes fixed on each other. That is, their forts, garrisons, and guns [are fixed] upon the frontiers of their kingdoms, and continual spies [are fixed] upon their neighbors, which is a posture of war. But because they uphold thereby the industry of their subjects, there does not follow from it that misery which accompanies the liberty of particular men.

**Nothing is Unjust**

To this war of every man against every man, this also is consequent, that nothing can be unjust. The notions of right and wrong, justice and injustice have there no place. Where there is no common power, there is no law; where no law, no injustice. Force and fraud are in war the two cardinal virtues. Justice and injustice are none of the [instinctive] faculties, neither of the body nor mind. If they were, they might be in a man that were alone in the world, as well as his senses and passions. They are qualities that relate to men in society, not in solitude. It is consequent also to the same condition, that there be no propriety, no dominion, no mine and thine distinct. But [there is] only that to be every man’s that he can get, and for so long as he can keep it. And thus much for the ill condition which man by mere nature is actually placed in; though with a possibility to come out of it consisting partly in the passions [and] partly in his reason.

             The passions that incline men to peace are fear of death, desire of such things as are necessary to commodious living, and a hope by their industry to obtain them. And reason suggests convenient articles of peace, upon which men may be drawn to agreement. These articles are they which otherwise are called the laws of nature. . . .

**Why People are Naturally Unsociable**

It is true that certain living creatures, [such] as bees and ants, live sociably one with another (which are therefore by Aristotle numbered among political creatures), and yet have no other direction than their particular judgments and appetites; nor speech, whereby one of them can signify to another what he thinks expedient for the common benefit. And therefore some man may perhaps desire to know why mankind cannot do the same. To which I answer,

             First, that men are continually in competition for honor and dignity, which these creatures are not. And consequently among men there arises on that ground, envy, and hatred, and finally war; but amongst these not so.

             Secondly, that among these creatures the common good differs not from the private; and being by nature inclined to their private, they procure thereby the common benefit. But man, whose joy consists in comparing himself with other men, can relish nothing but what is eminent.

             Thirdly, that these creatures, having not, as man, the use of reason, do not see, nor think they see, any fault in the administration of their common business. Whereas, among men, there are very many that think themselves wiser and abler to govern the public better than the rest, and these strive to reform and innovate, one this way, another that way; and thereby bring it into distraction and civil war.

             Fourthly, that these creatures, though they have some use of voice in making known to each other their desires and other affections, yet they want [i.e., lack] that art of words by which some men can represent to others that which is good in the likeness of evil; and evil, in the likeness of good; and augment or diminish the apparent greatness of good and evil, discontenting men and troubling their peace at their pleasure.

             Fifthly, irrational creatures cannot distinguish between injury and damage. And therefore as long as they be at ease, they are not offended with their fellows: whereas man is then most troublesome when he is most at ease. For then it is that he loves to show his wisdom, and control the actions of them that govern the Commonwealth.

             Lastly, the agreement of these creatures is natural; that of men is by covenant only, which is artificial. And therefore it is no wonder if there be somewhat else required, besides covenant, to make their agreement constant and lasting; which is a common power to keep them in awe and to direct their actions to the common benefit.

**Creating Peace and a Commonwealth through a Social Contract**

[There is only one] way to erect such a common power, as may be able to defend them from the invasion of foreigners, and the injuries of each other, and thereby to secure them in such sort as that by their own industry and by the fruits of the earth they may nourish themselves and live contentedly. [That way] is to confer all their power and strength upon one man, or upon one assembly of men, that may reduce all their wills, by plurality of voices, unto one will. Which is as much as to say, to appoint one man, or assembly of men, to bear their person; and everyone to own and acknowledge himself to be author of whatsoever he that so bears their person shall act, or cause to be acted, in those things which concern the common peace and safety; and therein to submit their wills, everyone to his will, and their judgments to his judgment. This is more than consent, or concord. It is a real unity of them all in one and the same person, made by covenant of every man with every man. [It is made] in such manner as if every man should say to every man: I authorize and give up my right of governing myself to this man, or to this assembly of men, on this condition; that thou give up, thy right to him, and authorize all his actions in like manner. This done, the multitude so united in one person is called a _commonwealth_; in Latin, _civitas_. This is the generation of that great _Leviathan_, or rather, to speak more reverently, of that mortal god to which we owe, under the immortal God, our peace and defense. For by this authority, given him by every particular man in the Commonwealth, he has the use of so much power and strength conferred on him that, by terror thereof, he is enabled to form the wills of them all, to peace at home, and mutual aid against their enemies abroad. And in him consists the essence of the Commonwealth, which, to define it, is: one person, of whose acts a great multitude, by mutual covenants one with another, have made themselves everyone the author, to the end he may use the strength and means of them all as he shall think expedient for their peace and common defense.

             And he that carries this person is called sovereign, and said to have sovereign power; and everyone besides, his subject.

**READING 2: GODWIN ON FOUR OBJECTIONS TO THE SOCIAL CONTRACT**

Upon the first statement of the system of a social contract various difficulties present themselves. Who are the parties to this contract? For whom did they consent, for themselves only or for others? For how long a time is this contract to be considered as binding? If the consent of every individual be necessary, in what manner is that consent to be given? Is it to be tacit, or declared in express terms?

**First Objection: Extending the Contract to Future Generations**

Little will be gained for the cause of equality and justice, if our ancestors, at the first institution of government, had a right indeed of choosing the system of regulations under which they thought proper to live, but at the same time could barter away the understandings and independence of all that came after them to the latest posterity [i.e., to current generations of people]. But, if the contract must be renewed in each successive generation, what periods must be fixed on for that purpose? And if I be obliged to submit to the established government till my turn comes to assent to it, upon what principle is that obligation founded? Surely not upon the contract into which my father entered before I was born?

**Second Objection: Limitations of Tacit Consent**

Secondly, what is the nature of the consent, in consequence of which I am to be reckoned the subject of any particular government? It is usually said, “that acquiescence is sufficient; and that this acquiescence is to be inferred from my living quietly under the protection of the laws.” But if this be true, an end is as effectually put to all political science, all discrimination of better and worse, as by any system invented by the most slavish sycophant that ever existed. Upon this hypothesis every government that is quietly submitted to is a lawful government, whether it be the usurpation of [English military leader] Cromwell or the tyranny of [Roman emperor] Caligula. Acquiescence [i.e., silent acceptance] is frequently nothing more than a choice on the part of the individual of what he deems the least evil. In many cases it is not [even] so much as this, since the peasant and the artisan, who form the bulk of a nation, however dissatisfied with the government of their country, seldom have it in their power to transport themselves to another. It is also to be observed upon the system of acquiescence, that it is in little agreement with the established opinions and practices of mankind. Thus what has been called the law of nations, lays least stress upon the allegiance of a foreigner settling among us, though his acquiescence is certainly most complete; while natives removing into an uninhabited region are claimed by the mother country, and removing into a neighboring territory are punished by municipal law, if they take arms against the country in which they were born. Now surely acquiescence can scarcely be construed into consent, while the individuals concerned are wholly unapprised of the authority intended to be rested upon it.

             Mr. Locke, the great champion of the doctrine of an original contract, has been aware of this difficulty, and therefore observes, that “a tacit consent indeed obliges a man to obey the laws of any government, as long as he has any possessions, or enjoyment of any part of the dominions of that government; but nothing can make a man a member of the commonwealth, but his actually entering into it by positive engagement, and express promise and compact.” A singular distinction; implying upon the face of it, that an acquiescence, such as has just been described, is sufficient to render a man amenable to the penal regulations of society; but that his own consent is necessary to entitle him to its privileges.

**Third Objection: Length of the Contract**

A third objection to the social contract will suggest itself, as soon as we attempt to ascertain the extent of the obligation, even supposing it to have been entered into in the most solemn manner by every member of the community. Allowing that I am called upon, at the period of my coming of age for example, to declare my assent or dissent to any system of opinions or any code of practical institutes; for how long a period does this declaration bind me? Am I precluded from better information for the whole course of my life? And, if not for my whole life, why for a year, a week or even an hour? If my deliberate judgment or my real sentiment be of no avail in the case, in what sense can it be affirmed that all lawful government is founded in my consent?

             But the question of time is not the only difficulty. If you demand my assent to any proposition, it is necessary that the proposition should be stated simply and clearly. So numerous are the varieties of human understanding, in all cases where its independence and integrity are sufficiently preserved, that there is little chance of any two men coming to a precise agreement about ten successive propositions that are in their own nature open to debate. What then can be more absurd than to present to me the laws of England in fifty volumes folio, and call upon me to give an honest and uninfluenced vote upon their whole contents at once?

             But the social contract, considered as the foundation of civil government, requires more of me than this. I am not only obliged to consent to all the laws that are actually upon record, but to all the laws that shall hereafter be made. It was under this view of the subject, that Rousseau, in tracing the consequences of the social contract, was led to assert, that “the great body of the people, in whom the sovereign authority resides, can neither delegate nor resign it. The essence of that authority,” he adds, “is the general will; and will cannot be represented. It must either be the same or another; there is no alternative. The deputies of the people cannot be its representatives; they are merely its attorneys. The laws, that the community does not ratify in person, are no laws, are nullities.”

             The difficulty here stated has been endeavored to be provided against by some late advocates for liberty, in the way of addresses of adhesion; addresses, originating in the various districts and departments of a nation, and without which no regulation of constitutional importance is to be deemed valid. But this is a very inadequate and superficial remedy. The addressers of course have seldom any other remedy than that above described, of in discriminate admission or rejection. There is an infinite difference between the first deliberation, and the subsequent exercise of a negative. The former is a real power, the latter is seldom more than the shadow of a power. Not to add, that addresses are a most precarious and equivocal mode of collecting the sense of a nation. They are usually voted in a tumultuous and summary manner; they are carried along by the tide of party; and the signatures annexed to them are obtained by indirect and accidental methods, while multitudes of bystanders, unless upon some extraordinary occasion, remain ignorant of or indifferent to the transaction.

**Fourth Objection: Divesting our Moral Rights**

Lastly, if government be founded in the consent of the people, it can have no power over any individual by whom that consent is refused. If a tacit consent be not sufficient, still less can I be deemed to have consented to a measure upon which I put an express negative. This immediately follows from the observations of Rousseau. If the people, or the individuals of whom the people is constituted, cannot delegate their authority to a representative; neither can any individual delegate his authority to a majority, in an assembly of which he is himself a member. The rules by which my actions shall be directed are matters of a consideration entirely personal; and no man can transfer to another the keeping of his conscience and the judging of his duties. But this brings us back to the point from which we set out. No consent of ours can divest us of our moral capacity [i.e., moral rights]. This is a species of property which we can neither barter nor resign; and of consequence it is impossible for any government to derive its authority from an original contract.

**INTRODUCTION**

Pam and Sheila were students at a large state university that had math and foreign language requirements. Pam was strong in languages, but lousy in math; Sheila had the opposite abilities. The two struck a deal: Pam would pose as Sheila in Sheila’s Spanish class, and Sheila would pose as Pam in Pam’s calculus class. For an entire semester, each attended the other’s specific class, answered to the other’s name, and took exams on behalf of the other. The university was so large that neither the professors nor the students in those courses knew the conspirators’ true identities. The ruse worked and they got A’s on their permanent records for the courses. This is probably the most extreme a case of cheating that could exist. It was not a matter of copying some answers from a neighbor’s test, or plagiarizing a term paper. Instead, every single requirement for both courses was fulfilled fraudulently, and neither Pam nor Sheila learned a single thing in the classes they were ducking. The risk they were taking was enormous, for, if caught, they would have been permanently expelled from their university. That, though, did not matter to either of them.

             There are opportunities for dishonesty in most facets of our lives: in games, on taxes, with business associates, with spouses. In all of these cases people break the rules for some personal gain. A stream of recent studies has shown that deceit is not only an integral part of human nature, but most of us routinely lie far more than we’d ever imagine: 90% of us lie at least once a day. One psychologist writes, “Lying is universal; it coexists side by side with the truth. In one way or another, lying is used daily in our social interactions” (George Serban, _Lying_, 2001). Most disturbing is a study showing that 60% of people lie about three times in a normal 10 minute conversation. Some are small lies, but others are enormous, such as a young man in the study who claimed to be in a rock band and have a recording contract when he did not even play an instrument. Some psychologists distinguish between deviant and normal lies. Deviant ones are condemned by society because they undermine the trust that enables societies to function, such as lying on the witness stand. Normal lies, though, are ones that we accept because of their productive social outcomes. You ask “How are you doing today?” to which I answer “Quite well, thank you!” even though it’s the worst day of my life. You ask “How do you like my hair cut?” to which I answer “It looks great!” even though your hair would frighten away a flock of birds.

             German philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) believed that we have a clear moral responsibility to be truthful. For Kant, our human reason makes moral demands on our lives. If we think rationally about how we should behave, then we will immediately see that some kinds of actions are unreasonable. Dishonesty in all of its forms, he argues, is fundamentally unreasonable. Many philosophers before Kant also said that morality is linked with the rational part of human nature. But Kant goes a step further and formulates a supreme rational principle that tells us precisely whether a specific action is right or wrong. He calls this principle the categorical imperative: Act only on that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law. According to the categorical imperative, it is wrong for me to be deceitful since I could not reasonably want everyone to act in that way. He explains this with the example of breaking one’s promise: “if no man were to keep his promise. . . . [then] promises would in the long run become useless.” So, it is unreasonable for me to wish this fate on humanity. If the categorical imperative succeeds as a true test of moral conduct, then it is the most important contribution to moral philosophy ever. All moral controversies would be quickly resolved, and no one could claim ignorance about their moral obligations. But does it succeed? In this chapter we will look at Kant’s account of the categorical imperative and discuss some of its problems.

**KANT’S MORAL THEORY**

Kant presents his moral theory in three principal books, published in the final two decades of his life: _The Foundations of the Metaphysics of Morals_ (1785), _The Critique of Practical Reason_ (1788), and _The Metaphysics of Morals_ (1797). The first of these, the _Foundations_, is the most influential, and our discussion of Kant’s categorical imperative will come mainly from this.

**Influences on Kant’s Theory**

To understand why Kant devised the categorical imperative as he did, it will help to look at his influences. It often takes detective work to discover the principal influences on major philosophers. Scholars might investigate where a great philosopher was educated and what texts were used in that school. They might comb through the philosopher’s personal correspondence to find references to books that he read. They might also discover the contents of a philosopher’s personal library by locating records of estate sales after his death. In Kant’s case, the task of discovering his influences is easy. Kant was born in Konigsberg, a Prussian city of about 70,000 people. He attended the University of Konigsberg and later held teaching posts there for forty years. In his writings as both a teacher and scholar, Kant left a clear paper trail indicating various influences on his philosophy.

             From the beginning of his university teaching career, Kant offered a course in ethics, and the contents of his lectures were eventually transcribed by some of his students. From these lectures, we know that Kant assigned two standard ethics textbooks written by German philosopher Alexander Baumgarten (1715–1762). Baumgarten’s texts discuss in detail the various moral duties that we have to God, ourselves, and others. For example, we have duties to believe in and pray to God, to develop our own intellectual abilities, to be benevolent to others. Eighteenth-century moral philosophers commonly offered similar lists of duties to God, oneself, and others—an approach that was formalized a century earlier by Samuel von Pufendorf (1632–1694). Influenced by Baumgarten and this tradition, Kant also believed that the task of morality is to inform us of our various duties—specifically, duties to ourselves and others.

             We also see in his lectures that Kant was influenced by the ethical writings of German philosopher Christian Wolff (1679–1754). Wolff believed that morality involves a quest to make ourselves and others more perfect. According to Wolff, I make myself more perfect by improving my body and mind, and I make others more perfect by helping and not harming them. For Wolff, all of my actions should be directed by this rule: “Do what makes you and your condition, or that of others, more perfect; omit what makes it less perfect.” Following the natural law tradition of moral philosophy, Wolff sees this rule as the fundamental law of nature. He also argues that human reason informs us of this rule and guides us in applying it. In contrast to some earlier philosophers, such as Pufendorf, who believed that God invents morality, Wolff argues that this fundamental rule of morality would be obligatory even if God did not exist:

Because this rule is a law because it obligates, and the obligation comes from nature, the law of nature is validated by nature itself and would hold even if man had no superior who could obligate him to it. In fact it would hold even if there were no God. [_Reasonable Thoughts on Human Action_, 1720, 1.1.23]

             Kant adopted different components of Wolff’s view of morality. First, like Wolff, Kant believes that we can express our moral obligation in a single principle. But Kant rejects Wolff’s specific moral principle and instead proposes the categorical imperative, which Kant believes better captures our duty dictated by reason. Second, like Wolff, Kant wholeheartedly believes that morality comes from the authority of human reason and is not simply invented by God. Kant states that “no one, not even God, can be the author of the laws of morality, since they have no origin in will, but instead a practical necessity” (_Lectures,_ “The Law Giver”).  Both Wolff and Kant believe that morality cannot arise from authoritarian mandates. This is not surprising since in the eighteenth century many writers rejected traditional authorities in a variety of areas including religion, politics, and academics. The only true guideline is human reason, and an enlightened person will follow his or her reason rather than the arbitrary edicts of self-proclaimed authorities. Kant clearly expresses this attitude in a brief essay on the subject of enlightenment:

Nothing is required for this enlightenment, however, except _freedom_; and the freedom in question is the least harmful of all, namely, the freedom to use reason _publicly_ in all matters. [“An Answer to the Question: What Is Enlightenment?”]

Kant continues by noting that we hear authoritarian commands all the time: “The taxman says ‘do not argue, pay!’ The pastor says ‘do not argue, believe!’” (ibid). But Kant counters that we _should_ argue and follow our reason.

             Kant may have followed Baumgarten and Wolff to some extent, but there were others whom he completely rejected. In his ethics lectures, he lists several philosophers who ground morality on emotions or feelings. For example, ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus (341–270 BCE) stressed that morality involves satisfying our senses and gaining selfish fulfillment. British philosopher Francis Hutcheson (1694–1747) believed that an internal moral feeling distinguishes between right and wrong conduct. Kant rejects these theories because they depend too much on the accidental makeup of human physiology, and on the particular circumstances that trigger emotional responses within us. Instead, Kant argues that morality is grounded in our reason, which is stable and universal.

**Motives that Influence the Human Will**

The aim of Kant’s book _The Foundations of the Metaphysics of Morals_ is, in his words, “to seek out and establish this supreme principle of morality”—that is, to explain the origin and function of the categorical imperative. Before presenting the categorical imperative, though, Kant says some things about human psychology and explains how the categorical imperative fits into the moral decision-making process.

             We all recognize that morality involves choices between different courses of action. If I see an accident victim alongside the road, I can choose to either help that person or not. To understand morality, then, I need to understand the factors that influence my will when making decisions. Philosophers of the 18th century commonly viewed the human will as something like a switch that turned on and off specific actions. We have countless motives that incline us toward various actions. For example, my motive of thirst inclines me to act out by getting a drink. My motive of greed inclines me to act out by accumulating money and possessions. My motive of sympathy inclines me to act out by helping people. The function of the will is to select a specific motive and thereby switch on a specific action.

             Kant similarly believes that various motives tug at our human will, prompting us to act in different ways. For Kant, motives fall into one of two classes: (1) selfish inclinations and (2) rational obligations. Unfortunately, most of our motives are of the selfish variety, and as long as we willfully select these motives, then our actions will never be truly moral. This is so even if I perform an action that appears to be morally proper. Suppose, for example, that I help an accident victim because I hope to get a reward. My motive in this case is selfish, so my act is not truly moral. Kant believes that morally pure motives must be rational considerations, which are universal and not personal or selfish. Specifically, the motive must be a rationally informed duty toward the categorical imperative. Let’s look more closely at Kant’s reasoning here.

             First, Kant believes that a moral choice must be a _rational_ decision since morality involves what is _necessary_ for us to do, and only rational considerations are necessary. For example, there is nothing necessary about my selfish inclination to obtain material wealth. At the same time, when we hear the moral command “Do not steal!” we recognize an element of necessity insofar as this command applies to everyone. Further, when we assess that anything in life is “necessary,” such as the truth of mathematical formulas, we are making a rational assessment, and this applies to morality as well. Second, Kant believes that with moral choices our rational motive must be in the form of a principle since human reason operates by issuing principles. Our reason gives us universal and necessary principles of mathematics, principles of logic, and, in this case, a principle of morality. Third, the principle must be in the form of a _command_ or _imperative_ since morality involves commands, such as “Do not steal!”

             To better clarify how the categorical imperative differs from selfish inclinations, Kant distinguishes the categorical imperative from hypothetical imperatives. Compare these two imperatives:

1. If you want to be a lawyer, then you must go to law school.

2. You must help others in need.

Although both of these statements are imperatives in the sense that they command us to perform some action, only the second is a _moral_ imperative. The first is a _hypothetical_ imperative in the sense that the commanded action (go to law school) applies to you only if you have a particular desire (to be a lawyer). Hypothetical imperatives will always be of the form “If you want _some thing_, then you must do _some act._” Since all people will not want the same things, hypothetical imperatives lack the element of necessity, and so are not truly moral commands. They are instead rules of personal preference. By contrast, the second imperative does not depend on whether you have some desire. Instead, it simply mandates, “You must do _some act_.” This is the form that our moral obligations take when they arise from the categorical imperative.

**The Formula of the Law of Nature**

So much for the psychology behind the categorical imperative. The most important part of Kant’s theory is the categorical imperative itself, the general formula of which is this:

Act only on that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.

The categorical imperative offers us a step-by-step procedure for determining the moral status of particular actions. First, I take a specific action, such as stealing my neighbor’s lawnmower. Second, I see what the guiding principle or “maxim” is behind the action, such as “I will steal my neighbor’s lawnmower to gain material wealth.” Third, I reflect on what that maxim would be like if it were a universal rule that everyone followed, such as “Everyone may steal his or her neighbor’s lawnmower to gain material wealth.” Fourth, if the universal rule is reasonable, then I accept the action as moral; if unreasonable, I reject the action as immoral. It is almost like asking “What would happen if everyone did this?” However, we do not want to consider what happens regarding our selfish inclinations, such as whether a universal rule would make me happy or not. Instead, we only want to look at what happens in our reasoning process as we think about a universal rule. Kant has a specific notion of reason in mind, with specific indicators about when a rule is rational or irrational. Kant gives four specialized formulations of the categorical imperative that reflect different facets of human rationality.

             The first and most famous formulation is sometimes called the Formula of the Law of Nature: “Act as if the maxim of your action were to become through your will a universal law of nature.” The wording of this is very close to that of the original statement of the categorical imperative. However, as Kant explains, the distinguishing feature here is that we consider whether our maxim could function as a law of nature—and specifically, whether it is free from contradiction. Suppose I tell you that gravity will make the rock in my right hand fall to the ground and will at the same time make the rock in my left hand hover in mid-air. You will think that this is impossible since laws of nature cannot be inconsistent like this. Similarly, this formula of the categorical imperative instructs us to search for a contradiction within a universalized maxim.

             To illustrate, Kant gives four examples that he thinks represent our main types of moral duties. The clearest of the four examples is this: Suppose I borrow money from you promising to return it later, but I know full well that I will not return it. The intended maxim or guiding principle behind my action is this: “Whenever I believe myself short of money, I will borrow money and promise to pay it back, though I know that this will never be done.” Kant then explains that a contradiction arises once I view this maxim as a universal rule. Specifically, if such deceit were followed universally, then the whole institution of promising would be undermined and I could not make my promise to begin with. So, on the one hand, I state “I promise such and such” yet, on the other, once universalized the practice of promise keeping itself would be nonexistent.

             In another example, Kant explains why it is wrong for me to kill myself when misfortunes push me to the point of despair. The maxim of this action is “From self-love I make it my principle to shorten my life if its continuance threatens more evil than it promises pleasure.” But a law of nature of this sort would be contradictory. The self-love principle inclines me to preserve my life, but according to this maxim, it also inclines me to end my life. In a third example, Kant explains why I must develop my talents rather than let them waste away. The maxim of the contrary action might be something like “I will let my talents decay and devote my life to idleness.” Kant concedes that this maxim by itself is not contradictory since in theory everyone could become an idle slug. However, the contradiction emerges when I willfully assert this maxim while at the same time acknowledging my inherent rational obligation to develop my talents. In a final example, Kant explains why it is wrong to be uncharitable. The maxim of this action might be “I will not help someone in need.” Similar to the last example, a contradiction arises when I willfully assert this maxim while at the same time acknowledging my inherent rational obligation to receive charity when I am in need.

             From these four examples, two different types of contradictions emerge. The first example in particular involves an internal contradiction within the proposed universal rule; the last two involve a contradiction between the proposed universal rule and another inherently rational obligation. The important point, though, is that a particular maxim fails as a universal law of nature if a contradiction arises at some point once a maxim is universalized.

**The Formula of the End in itself**

The second formulation of the categorical imperative is called the Formula of the End in Itself: “Act in such a way that you always treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never simply as a means, but always at the same time as an end.” In other words, we should not use people as objects, but instead recognize the inherent dignity and value that we all have. It helps to understand Kant’s point if we distinguish between things that have merely _instrumental_ value and things that have _inherent_ value. Some things in life are valuable only as instruments to obtain something else. My car keys, for example, are very valuable to me, and when I lose them, my life grinds to a halt. But my car keys are valuable only as tools that perform a task—namely, the task of starting my car. Even the value of my car itself is mainly instrumental insofar as it allows me to get from one place to another. By contrast, other things in life are inherently valuable, and we appreciate them for what they are, and not for what they enable us to do. Companionship and the enjoyment of music are good examples. We do not think of these as being instruments for any further benefit, but instead appreciate them for what they are in and of themselves.

             Kant believes that human beings have inherent value and should never be treated as instruments:

In so [improperly] acting man reduces himself to a thing, to an instrument of animal amusement. We are, however, as human beings, not things but persons, and by turning ourselves into things we dishonor human nature in our own persons. [_Lectures_, “The Supreme Principle of Morality”]

The reason humans have inherent value, according to Kant, is because, unlike animals, we have the ability to rise above our brute instincts and to freely make crucial decisions in shaping our lives and the world around us. Everything else in the world is driven by purely mechanistic forces, but we are different with our ability to make free choices. This freedom of the will is a feature of our human reason, and it confers on us an inherent dignity that is valuable in and of itself. We have a moral responsibility, then, to treat people in ways that reflect their inherent value, and not to reduce people to mere objects of instrumental value. So, when I treat someone as an _end_, I respect her inherent value; and when I treat someone as a _means_, I see her as having only instrumental value.

             Kant explains that there is both a negative and positive component to this formula. The negative component is that we should _avoid_ treating people as a mere means. But this tells us only to abstain from using people as instruments, which is a bare minimum obligation. The positive component is that we should _undertake_ to treat people as an end in themselves. This tells us to actively assist or support others in retaining their dignity. It is not enough simply to avoid abusing people; we must go a step further and help them, especially when misfortune strikes them.

             Kant again illustrates this formula with the same four examples that we considered earlier. If I make a deceitful promise to you with the intention of acquiring financial gain, then I’m treating you as a thing or instrument and not recognizing your inherent value. If I commit suicide, then I am using myself as a means to attain a tolerable state of affairs until the point that I’m actually dead. If I let my talents decline, then I am not acknowledging my inherent worth as a rational person who shapes the world through my decisions; I’m not treating myself as an end. And if I fail to help people in need, then I am not helping them maintain their dignity; I’m failing to treat them as an end. The first two examples illustrate the negative obligation to avoid treating people as a means, and the last two illustrate the positive obligation to undertake treating people as an end.

             Kant’s first two formulations of the categorical imperative are the most famous of the four and he devotes the most attention to these. The remaining two formulations draw from the central points of both the first and second formulations. The third is the formula of autonomy: “So act that your will can regard itself at the same time as making universal law through its maxims.” The focus of this formula is the authority that rests within our human will to productively shape the world around us when following reason. As we act, we should consider whether our intended maxims are worthy of our status as shapers of the world.

             The fourth formulation is the formula of the kingdom of ends: “So act as if you were through your maxims a law-making member of a kingdom of ends.” The point here is that the moral fate of all people hangs together. We saw that Kant thinks of human beings as ends in themselves, and so, collectively, we are a “kingdom of ends” or, more simply, a moral community. As I act, I should consider whether my actions contribute to or detract from the moral community. Specifically, I should consider whether the intended maxim of my action could productively function as a universal rule in the moral community.

             To summarize, here are the main points of Kant’s theory:

• Motives behind true moral choices are not those of selfish inclination but instead those of a rational duty conforming to the categorical imperative.

• Hypothetical imperatives have the form “If you want _some thing_, then you must do _some act_”; the categorical imperative mandates, “You must do _some act_.”

• The general formula of the categorical imperative has us consider whether the intended maxim of our action would be reasonable as a universal law.

• Specific formulations of the categorical imperative focus on a particular feature of human rationality, such as the absence of contradiction, free choice, and inherent dignity.

**CRITICISMS OF KANT’S THEORY**

Kant was an original thinker not only in the field of ethics but in virtually every area of philosophy. His reputation skyrocketed during the last two decades of his life, and during the nineteenth century his writings were more influential in Europe than those of any other philosopher. Many philosophers adopted his theories and perpetuated a specialized Kantian vocabulary. Others, however, were less happy with Kant’s elaborate philosophical system and picked away at parts of it, including the categorical imperative.

**Schopenhauer’s Criticism: The Categorical Imperative Reduces to Egoism**

Kant’s writings were a source of inspiration for German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer (1788–1860). Although Schopenhauer followed Kant in many particulars, he criticizes different aspects of Kant’s philosophy that do not quite mesh with his own. This includes Kant’s categorical imperative. For Schopenhauer, Kant’s categorical imperative simply reduces to the egoistic principle that “I should not do to others what I do not want done to myself.”

             To explain, Schopenhauer believes that human conduct is guided sometimes by sympathy for other people and other times by selfish or egoistic concerns for oneself. Genuine moral conduct, he argues, must be sympathetic, but Kant denied the role of sympathy as a legitimate motive behind such conduct. Sympathy is a fellow feeling or sense of commiseration that we have with other people. Like other feelings—such as happiness and self-love—sympathy focuses on specific people and specific situations. All such feelings, Kant says, are too unstable and unreliable to be an effective foundation for morality. According to Schopenhauer, if I shun my feelings of sympathy—as Kant recommends—then egoism will drive how I consider the universal implications of my actions in the categorical imperative. Without sympathy, the _real_ step-by-step procedure of the categorical imperative is this: (1) I consider how willing I am to allow the egoism of others to encroach on my territory, and then (2) I recognize that this is as far as I can allow my own egoism to encroach on other people’s territory. Schopenhauer makes this point here:

This aim [concerning the well-being of all], however, still always remains [egoistic] well-being. I then find that all can be equally well off only if each makes the egoism of others the limit of his own. It naturally follows from this that I ought not to injure anyone, so that, since the principle is assumed to be universal, I also may not be injured. This, however, is the only ground on account of which I, not yet possessing a moral principle but only looking for one, can desire this to be a universal law. But obviously in this way the desire for well-being, in other words egoism, remains the source of this ethical principle. [_The World as Will and Representation_ (1818-1819), Vol. 1, appendix]

For Schopenhauer, morality begins with my egoistic desire for my own well-being, which I then universalize into a principle that aims at the well-being of everyone.

             Schopenhauer believes that this is good enough for the purpose of establishing political laws that regulate how we behave as citizens, since political laws mainly limit how much we can encroach on other people’s territory. However, Schopenhauer argues, this is not sufficient for establishing moral obligations that go beyond the bare minimum obligations that we find in legal codes. For example, morality may require that we more aggressively help others in need, and egoism is inadequate for that task. For this we need sympathy.

             How might we defend Kant from Schopenhauer’s charge of egoism? For the sake of argument, let’s suppose that Schopenhauer is correct that either something like sympathy or something like egoism must be the driving force behind our consideration of the universal implications of our actions. Even though Kant rejects a specific notion of sympathy—that is, sympathy as a feeling toward particular people—he still believes that there is a humanitarian emphasis within human reason. Although reason cannot directly instruct me to sympathize with this or that person, it does instruct me to sympathize with the whole race of humans. This more generalized notion of sympathy emerges in the Formula of the End in Itself, which tells us to respect the inherent value of all people. We’ve seen that this formula includes the positive mandate to treat people as ends in themselves by helping them when in need. This goes beyond the purely negative mandate to avoid treating people as a means or using them as an instrument. This reflects Schopenhauer’s precise point that there is more to morality than simply not encroaching on other people’s territory. The solution, then, to Schopenhauer’s egoistic spin on the categorical imperative is to accept a more generalized notion of sympathy toward humanity.

**Hegel’s Criticism: The Categorical Imperative has no Practical Application**

A second early criticism of the categorical imperative is that by German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831). Like Schopenhauer, Hegel too focuses on the Formula of the Law of Nature: Act as if the maxim of your action were to become through your will a universal law of nature. According to Hegel, this formula “is reduced to empty formalism, and moral science is converted into mere rhetoric about duty for duty’s sake.” That is, it does not offer a clear guideline for assessing moral conduct, and it does not provide us with any specific moral duties that we can follow. The crux of the problem, for Hegel, is that the categorical imperative is a moral litmus test based on the absence or presence of a contradiction. While this may sound good in the abstract, it is difficult to detect contradictions within concrete actions that we know are contradictory. Hegel gives two examples here:

The rule that there should be no private property contains of itself no contradiction, nor does the proposition that this or that particular nation or family should not exist, or that no one should live at all. Only if it is really fixed and assumed that private property and human life should exist and be respected, is it a contradiction to commit theft or murder. [_The Philosophy of Right_ (1820), Sect. 135]

The first example is the claim that “there should be no private property,” which is a position that we would all want to reject. Even communists or religious monks who take vows of poverty recognize that we have at least some private property, such as our toothbrushes and the clothes that we wear. But, Hegel argues, wherein lies the contradiction when making this claim? The second example is that a particular nation, family, or even the entire human race should not exist at all. At its worst, this claim would mean that genocide and even omnicide—the killing of all humans—would be morally permissible. Where, though, is the inherent contradiction in this claim? According to Hegel, in the absence of any clear contradiction, there is no way of ruling this out, and “all manner of wrong and immoral acts may be by such a method justified.”

             What can we say in defense of Kant? First, it is important to recognize that, with any moral principle, there will be a gap between how it appears as an abstract statement, and how we apply it in concrete situations. Take a basic abstract moral principle like “do not harm others”. The challenge here is determining what counts as harm, and how serious that harm must be before it becomes morally wrong. Suppose that my hands are dirty, and I shake hands with you. You do not want the grime that’s just been transferred onto your hands and have to wash them off, taking up one minute of your life and costing you one cent in hand soap. Does the harm here rise to the level of immorality? Probably not, but somehow we must decide whether the abstract principle “do not harm others” applies in this particular case. Applying Kant’s Categorical Imperative in concrete situations may also be challenging, but this is a challenge that is built into the application of any general moral principle.

             Second, Kant provides enough examples to demonstrate how we apply the categorical imperative in concrete situations, particularly using the litmus test of detecting a contradiction. The example of deceitful promises is a perfect illustration of how an immoral maxim may produce an internal contradiction when universalized. If we universally allow deceitful promises, this means that we may (1) keep our word and (2) not keep our word at the same time. This is as explicit a contradiction as one can get. Other immoral maxims do not lead to explicit _internal_ contradictions like this, and, instead, Kant tries to show how they lead to _external_ contradictions. We’ve seen that external contradictions occur between (1) the proposed universal rule and (2) another inherent rational obligation. For example, it is wrong to waste my talents since it is contrary to my inherent rational obligation to develop my talents. It is wrong to deny charity to others since it is contrary to my inherent rational wish to receive charity when I am in need.

             For most other immoral actions that Kant does not specifically illustrate, it is easiest to see these as involving external contradictions as well. Stealing is wrong, perhaps, because it is contrary to our rational obligation to live in peace with our neighbors. Murder is wrong, perhaps, because it is contrary to our rational obligation to respect the lives of others. This applies equally to Hegel’s example of genocide and omnicide, since these are contrary to our rational obligation to respect human life. With Hegel’s other example, that of prohibiting private property, this is contrary to our rational duty to take care of our minds and bodies. Such care of ourselves requires that we have at least some private property, just as, for example, a bird claims some type of ownership of its nest.

**Mill’s Criticism: The Categorical Imperative Reduces to Utilitarianism**

British philosopher John Stuart Mill (1806–1873) developed a view of morality that was about as contrary to Kant’s theory as one could imagine. Kant believed that our moral duties spring immediately from human reason, without any consideration of the tangible effects of our actions on our personal happiness. For Kant, the categorical imperative is a method of directly accessing the commands of our reason, independent of other considerations. By contrast, Mill believed that our moral obligations spring only from considerations of how our actions affect human happiness. Mill proposes his own principle of morality, which he calls the “utilitarian principle”: “Actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness; wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness.” According to this principle, we look at the consequences of our actions and assess whether they bring about more happiness than unhappiness.

             Mill was aware of Kant’s categorical imperative and the enormous influence that Kant’s theory had on philosophers of the time. However, Mill argues that the categorical imperative does not succeed as a purely rational source of obligation. Instead, he says, it is actually a disguised version of the utilitarian principle—which is the very last thing that Kant thought his principle was:

[Kant lays] down a universal first principle as the origin and ground of moral obligation; it is this: “So act, that the rule on which thou actest would admit of being adopted as a law by all rational beings.” But when he begins to deduce from this precept any of the actual duties of morality, he fails, almost grotesquely, to show that there would be any contradiction, any logical (not to say physical) impossibility, in the adoption by all rational beings of the most outrageously immoral rules of conduct. All he shows is that the consequences of their universal adoption would be such as no one would choose to incur. [_Utilitariansim_ (1863), 1]

Although Mill cites the general formula of the categorical imperative in the above quote, he directs his attack against the Formula of the Law of Nature, which tells us that an action is wrong if a contradiction arises when universalizing the intended maxim. According to Mill, the categorical imperative fails to reveal any such contradiction, and the only thing it does reveal is that the consequences of universalizing a maxim involve more unhappiness than happiness.

             Part of Mill’s criticism sounds much like Hegel’s: the categorical imperative fails as a moral litmus test since contradictions do not arise when universalizing immoral actions. We’ve already seen how Kant can overcome Hegel’s objection. But there is a second part to Mill’s criticism that is potentially fatal to Kant’s theory: universalization is not about rational conflicts, it’s about envisioning good or bad consequences. Suppose I tell you that I’m going to cheat on my taxes, and in response you say “what if everyone did that?” My natural inclination to your question is to envision the disastrous effects this would have on the country, and then hopefully conclude that I should have nothing to do with that. Kant, though, is telling me that I’m looking at the issue of universalization improperly. I should ignore the harmful consequences of universalized tax evasion, and, instead, hunt for a contradiction, either internal or external. But this is a tough task to accomplish. It requires a college course in ethics to understand what it means for universalized maxims to be “contradictory”, and Kant’s examples of exposing contradictions are not obvious. Thus, Kant’s conception of universalization is unnatural, difficult to grasp, and probably impossible to follow in real life situations. Although Kant thinks that universalization merely involves looking for the presence of a contradiction, according to Mill we are actually envisioning the unpleasant effects of a universalized rule.

             How might Kant respond to Mill’s criticism? The short answer is that Kant is in fact trying to rescue the moral principle of universalization from the distorted ways that consequentialists like Mill have been using it. Kant would probably agree that universalized tax evasion would have bad effects on society. That is just a natural side effect of widespread deceit. What Kant is saying, though, is that harmful effects do not _make_ actions immoral. There is something inherently wrong with the actions themselves because they conflict with our rational intuitions about moral duty. We must reject the whole tendency to link morality with consequences. If universalization is only about envisioning consequences, then universalization must be rejected as a moral guideline. But Kant is trying to salvage our common tendency to connect universalization and morality when we ask the question “what if everyone did that?” Yes, Kant’s view of universalization is a bit odd, but it’s better than rejecting the entire conception of universalization because of its faulty connection with consequences. Universalization still can be an important moral litmus test, in spite of its tainted consequentialist history.

**Anscombe’s Criticism: There Is No Procedure for Constructing Maxims**

In a famous essay entitled “Modern Moral Philosophy” (1958), contemporary British philosopher Elizabeth Anscombe criticizes virtually the entire lineup of traditional moral philosophers. With regard to Kant, she argues that Kant’s “rule about universalizable maxims is useless without stipulations as to what shall count as a relevant description of an action with a view to constructing a maxim about it.” That is, for any action I pick, I could devise a wide variety of maxims that might represent my action. But how do I know which one is the correct maxim? To illustrate Anscombe’s criticism, we will use a rather grotesque example that Kant himself discusses. Suppose I yank out one of my healthy teeth and sell it to a dentist, who will then insert it into someone else’s mouth. We would expect any adequate moral theory to condemn this action. So, if Kant is correct, universalizing this action should generate a contradiction. But what is the maxim of my action here? It might be that “I should pull out my tooth and sell it to a dentist,” or that “I should extract a healthy part of my body and sell it,” or that “I should pull out my right upper molar and sell it to a dentist by the name of John Smith.” Each of these maxims has entirely different implications, and if I cannot figure out exactly which maxim represents my action, then I cannot test the action by universalizing it. So, Kant’s categorical imperative fails to give us the guidance that we need.

             In defense of Kant, Anscombe’s criticism misses the point about what a “maxim” is, and Kant really does provide an appropriate way to construct maxims. The key to constructing a maxim is to determine the _intention_ behind an action. Kant illustrates the connection between maxims and intentions here:

Every immoral man has his maxims May a man, for instance, mutilate his body for profit? May he sell a tooth? May he surrender himself at a price to the highest bidder? . . . What is the intent in these cases? It is to gain material advantage. [_Lectures_, “The Supreme Principle of Morality]

Kant is correct that, if we want to understand the moral worth of someone’s action, we must look beyond the specific action and examine the underlying intention. For example, if I hit a pedestrian while driving my car, from a moral standpoint it makes a big difference whether I was hoping to hit or to avoid the pedestrian. Just as it is important to discover one’s underlying intention in moral assessments, it is also important in criminal law, especially in determining the severity of punishment. Today, we do not speak about the _maxim_ of our actions but prefer to speak simply about our _intention_. However, philosophers in Kant’s time were comfortable viewing intentions as maxims. Wolff, for example, writes that “man must have certain maxims or general rules according to which he directs his action, even if he himself does not clearly recognize this.”

             In constructing my maxim, then, I look to my intention. In the case of the extracted tooth, my intention is, in Kant’s words, “to gain material advantage.” The more precisely stated maxim is that “I should disfigure myself by extracting my tooth to gain material advantage.” In the spirit of Anscombe’s criticism, we must acknowledge that it is sometimes difficult to uncover the exact intention behind our actions, but that’s a problem that plagues morality in general, and not just Kant’s theory. In criminal court cases, prosecutors and defense attorneys may battle for days over a defendant’s true underlying intention. It may not be any easier for us as individuals when we struggle to discover why we do things. In fact, Kant believes that it is nearly impossible to discover our precise intentions:

We can never, even by the strictest examination, get completely behind the secret incentives of action; since, when the question is of moral worth, it is not with the actions which we see that we are concerned, but with those inward principles of them which we do not see. [_Foundations_, 2]

Although I may not know what my exact intentions are for a given action, I can make a best guess or even consider a few possible intentions just to cover all the bases. With the categorical imperative, then, I may have to devise a few maxims and see what the outcome of each would be when universalized. This adds extra steps to the categorical imperative, but they are steps that realistically reflect our limited knowledge of our intentions.

**LINGERING PROBLEMS WITH THE CATEGORICAL IMPERATIVE**

Kant’s categorical imperative continues to hold an important place in moral philosophy today, and his two most lasting contributions are the Formula of the Law of Nature and the Formula of the End in Itself. The one is a unique way of looking at the concept of universalization: formulate a maxim and detect a contradiction with it when universalized. The other is a unique way of grounding morality in the intrinsic value and dignity of people. In this final section, we will look at some stubborn problems with these formulas.

**The Formula of the Law of Nature reduces to Traditional Duty Theory**

One lingering problem with Kant’s Formula of the Law of Nature is the degree to which it differs from the traditional duty theories of Pufendorf, Wolff and Baumgarten. In spite of Kant’s attempt to depart from traditional duty theory, he may not have moved as far beyond it as he believed. The heart of the problem is that Kant attempts to model all moral judgments after the example of deceitful promises, but it is not a very good model to follow. The illustration of deceitful promises is a very striking one, and it does produce an internal contradiction. If we say as a general rule that we may make deceitful promises, then we logically contradict the concept of promise keeping itself. Specifically, we make a promise and deny the institution of promise keeping at the same time. This is the example that he starts with in the _Foundations,_ and the one that he devotes the most time to.  But this seems to be a one-of-a-kind example, and none of Kant’s other illustrations are like this. While the example of suicide is similar, it is much weaker and does not produce a genuine contradiction. The contradiction with the suicide maxim, as Kant explains it, is that the self-love principle inclines me to preserve my life but also inclines me to end my life. This, though, is not a contradiction when the differing inclinations happen at different times. When things are normal, self-love inclines us to live; when we’re in chronic pain at the end stages of cancer, self-love inclines us to put ourselves out of our misery. This is no different than saying that the self-love principle inclines us to eat food when we’re hungry, and not eat food when we’re full.

             The remaining two examples—wasting one’s talents, and being uncharitable—differ from that of deceitful promises in two important ways. First, the contradictions with these two are not internal but external. For example, wasting one’s talents is wrong since it is contrary to a rational obligation to develop one’s talents. In more traditional terminology, wasting one’s talents is wrong since it is contrary to the _duty_ to develop one’s talents. The contradiction arises only when we presume the existence of an independent duty. In our discussion of Hegel’s criticism, we saw that this is probably the best way to see contradictions with most other immoral actions, such as stealing or murder. The second difference involves universalization. With deceitful promises, an internal contradiction arises _only_ when the act is considered as a universal rule. However, the process of universalization is not needed to detect external conflicts with our rational obligations or “duties.” If _I alone_ fail to develop my talents, then I am still acting contrary to my rational obligation to develop such talents. If _I alone_ kill myself, then I am still acting contrary to my rational obligation to stay alive.

             There may be other examples like the deceitful promise one that do indeed produce internal contradictions, but a single example alone does not constitute a general moral principle. If Kant himself could not find other examples like this one, then the odds are slim that our luck will be any better. Aside from the one-of-a-kind example of deceitful promises, then, Kant’s Formula of the Law of Nature merely tells us that an action is wrong if it violates a duty. And this is essentially what we find in the traditional duty theories of Pufendorf, Wolff, and Baumgarten. Again, these philosophers held that the laws of nature mandate a specific set of duties to God, self, and others, and that an action is wrong if it violates these specific duties.

             In short, Kant’s Formula of the Law of Nature at first appears to be a unique way of rationally discovering our moral obligations by exposing a contradiction, but in reality it appears to be the same old duty theory of his predecessors. Except for the unique situation of deceitful promises, the lesson that we learn from the Formula of the Law of Nature is that we must follow our specific moral duties that we know through our natural intuition. This is not at all a bad lesson, but it is by no means a unique one. In fact, Kant’s formulation of the law of nature is a rather cumbersome way of telling us to follow our intuitive duties, and, to that extent, we’d be better off embracing a more intuitive guideline about moral duty from one of Kant’s predecessors.

**The Formulas not Equivalent**

A second lingering problem with the categorical imperative concerns Kant’s belief that the various formulas of it were only different ways of expressing the same underlying conviction. For Kant, the feature that underlies all four of them is that we should be guided by our rational conception of duty. The first formula reflects the fact that rational decisions do not involve contradictions, such as is present in the deceitful promise example. The second involves recognizing the dignity and intrinsic value of all rational human beings when we act. The third involves deciding whether our intended maxims are worthy of our status as rational shapers of the world. The fourth involves deciding whether our maxims productively function as universal rules in the rational moral community.  We can almost envision Kant asking himself “what are all the ways that moral duty manifests itself for rational creatures, like human beings?” Let’s just consider the first two formulas, which are the most famous. In a very general way, yes, they are tied together as expressions of humans as rational beings. But, it takes a great stretch of the imagination to see how they have much in common as practical principles that guide our moral conduct. Rejecting contradictions is one thing, and treating people with dignity and intrinsic value is another. The first is the task of a logician, and the second the task of a moral saint. It is misleading to call both of these tasks rational, since it requires defining the word “rational” in an overly broad way.

             But Kant’s motive in linking together his various formulas may again owe to the influence of his predecessors. Natural law theorists from the time of Aquinas believed that natural law dictates a single highest principle of morality, and all of our duties are unified in that principle. So too with Baumgarten and Wolff. Roughly, for Kant, their highest principle reduces to the mere claim that “we must do good and avoid evil.” This, Kant argues, has no actual substance and simply means that we are _morally obliged to be moral_. Kant then proposed his categorical imperative to replace the empty principle suggested by Wolff and Baumgarten. To Kant’s way of thinking, everything that we say about our moral obligations must be grounded in a single principle. He then labored to show how the different facets of our moral reasoning tie together in a unified system. Fortunately, today, we do not have to follow the systematic plan of morality laid out by the natural law theorists. It is enough to acknowledge and appreciate Kant’s distinct formulas and their moral implications for how we view ourselves and others. We do not need to continue trying to squeeze those insights into a unified system that flows from a single highest moral principle.

             Since Kant’s own time, most discussions of the categorical imperative have focused on the Formula of the Law of Nature and the quest for a supposed contradiction. Philosophers who enjoy abstract moral theory are particularly attracted to this one since it presents an alluring conceptual challenge. But the real contribution of Kant’s categorical imperative may rest in his Formula of the End in Itself, which is both a natural and effective way of making moral judgments. This principle tells us that we should always treat people with dignity, recognizing their intrinsic value, and never treat them as mere instruments to manipulate for our own purpose. If we review our various immoral actions, they all seem to involve using people as instruments and not recognizing their intrinsic value. If I commit an act of theft, deception, assault, or murder, I am using my victim as a tool for my own gratification, and I am certainly not respecting that person’s dignity.

             Returning to our opening example, if we see that morality mandates respect for the intrinsic value and dignity of people, it becomes clear why it was immoral for Pam and Sheila to switch places in their college classes. First, the two students treated their teachers as objects to be manipulated for the student’s advantage. The teachers placed their trust in the two young women, acknowledging their inherent value, and the women returned the favor by taking advantage of the teachers and making a mockery of the teachers’ own inherent value. Further, by tricking their way into a passing grade, the students treated themselves as objects: they failed to acknowledge their own intrinsic value and thereby to develop their talents while fraudulently claiming that they did. This is probably the best explanation anyone could give for why it is wrong to cheat in school.

             Thus, if we think of moral principles as guidelines for our conduct, then the Formula of the End in Itself seems especially accurate. It also preaches a message about how to become better people: Do not think of people as things that we can manipulate. This reflects the importance of human freedom and our ability to make personal and rational choices in the face of authoritarian attempts to restrict us. To be rational humans _means_ that we make choices that shape our lives and the world around us. We need to respect that feature within all people, and make such respect the cornerstone of morality.

**SUMMARY**

Influenced by his predecessors in the natural law tradition, Kant offered the categorical imperative as the supreme principle of morality from which all moral duties emerge. The categorical imperative originates from human reason—as opposed to selfish inclinations—and Kant argued that it can be formulated in different ways, emphasizing different components of human reason. The Formula of the Law of Nature suggests that truly moral actions are those that are free from contradiction when universalized. The Formula of the End in Itself suggests that truly moral actions are those that acknowledge and support a person’s dignity and inherent value. Schopenhauer argued that the categorical imperative is essentially egoistic since Kant rejects the role of sympathetic feelings. In response, Kant emphasized the importance of inherent human value, which is a generalized sympathy. Hegel argued that the categorical imperative has no practical application since it is difficult to detect contradictions within concrete actions. In response, Kant provided clear examples of how contradictions might arise from maxims. Mill argued that the categorical imperative’s conception of universalization is really utilitarianism in disguise. In response, Kant is attempting to rescue the concept of universalization from the tendency to look at consequences. Anscombe criticized the categorical imperative for failing to tell us how to construct maxims. In response, maxims are statements of intention behind an action, which may be difficult to accurately identify. Finally, the Formula of the Law of Nature does not depart much from traditional duty theory, and the true contribution of the categorical imperative is the Formula of the End in Itself, with its emphasis on the intrinsic value and dignity of people.

**READING 1: KANT ON ABSOLUTE DUTIES**

_Introduction: Kant is often classified as a “moral absolutist”, meaning that, for him, there are some moral obligations that should never be violated under any circumstances whatever. He calls these “unconditional duties” and contrasts them with “conditional duties” which are weaker and can be broken when they conflict with those that are unconditional and absolute. In the selections below, he mentions three such absolute duties: truth-telling, protecting the State, and not taking an innocent life. In his explanation of truth-telling, Kant discusses a famous thought experiment by French philosopher Benjamin Constant, now called the case of the inquiring murderer. Suppose a murderer was chasing a friend of mine, who I hid in my house, and the murderer asked me directly if my friend was inside. Would it be wrong for me to lie to the murderer? Kant says that it would be wrong._

**The Absolute Duty to Tell the Truth**

In . . . _Political Reactions_, by Benjamin Constant, the following passage occurs:

The moral principle that it is one's duty to speak the truth, if it were taken singly and unconditionally, would make all society impossible. We have the proof of this in the very direct consequences which have been drawn from this principle by a German philosopher, who goes so far as to affirm that to tell a falsehood to a murderer who asked us whether our friend, of whom he was in pursuit, had not taken refuge in our house, would be a crime.

I hereby admit that I have really said this in some place which I cannot now recollect. The French philosopher [i.e., Benjamin Constant] opposes this principle in the following manner:

It is a duty to tell the truth. The notion of duty is inseparable from the notion of right. A duty is what in one being corresponds to the right of another. Where there are no rights there are no duties. To tell the truth then is a duty, but only towards him who has a right to the truth. But no man has a right to a truth that injures others.

The primary error here lies in the statement [by Constant] that “To tell the truth is a duty, but only towards him. who has a right to the truth.”

             It is to be remarked, first, that the expression “to have a right to the truth” is without meaning. We should rather say, a man has a right to his own truthfulness, that is, to subjective truth in his own person. For to have a right objectively to truth would mean that (as in the mine and thine generally) it depends on his will whether a given statement will be true or false, which would produce a strange logic.

             Now, the first question is whether a man—in cases where he cannot avoid answering Yes or No—has the right to be untruthful. The second question is whether, in order to prevent a misdeed that threatens him or someone else, he is not actually bound to be untruthful in a certain statement to which an unjust compulsion forces him.

             Truth in utterances that cannot be avoided is the formal duty of a man to everyone, however great the disadvantage that may arise from it to him or any other; and although by making a false statement I do no wrong to him who unjustly compels me to speak, yet I do wrong to men in general in the most essential point of duty, so that it may be called a lie (though not in the legal sense). That is, I do all in my power to bring about a state of things wherein. no statement whatever any longer finds belief, hence wherein all rights based upon agreements crumble away and lose their power, which is a wrong committed upon mankind in general.

             If then we define a lie merely as an intentionally false declaration towards another man, we need not add that it must injure another; as lawyers think proper to put in their definition (“a false statement to the disadvantage of another”). For it always injures another; if not another individual, yet mankind generally, since it makes the source of justice useless.

             This benevolent lie may, however, by accident become punishable even by civil laws; for, that which escapes liability to punishment only by accident may be condemned as a wrong even by external laws. For instance, if you have by a lie prevented a man who is even now planning a murder, you are legally responsible for all the consequences. But if you have strictly adhered to the truth, public justice can find no fault with you, be the unforeseen consequence what it may. It is possible that while you have honestly answered “yes” to the murderer's question, whether his intended victim is in the house, the victim may have escaped unobserved, and thus avoided the murderer, and the deed therefore have not been done. However, if you lied and said he was not in the house, and he had really escaped (though un known to you) so that the murderer met and killed him as he went, then you could be justly charged with the victim’s death. For, if you had spoken the truth to the best of your knowledge, perhaps the murderer, while searching for his enemy in the house, might have been caught by the arrival of neighbors and the deed been prevented. Whoever then tells a lie, however good his intentions may be, must answer for the consequences of it, even before the civil tribunal, and must pay the penalty for them, however unforeseen they may have been. For, truthfulness is a duty that must be regarded as the basis of all duties founded on contract, and the laws of contracts would be rendered uncertain and useless if even the least exception to them were admitted.

             To be truthful and honest in all statements is therefore a sacred unconditional command of reason and not to be limited by any convenience.

**The Absolute Duties to Protect the State and to Not Take an Innocent Life**

There is no case of [moral] necessity except in the case where an unconditional duty conflicts with a duty which though perhaps great is only conditional. For example, the question may be about preserving the State from disaster by betraying a person who stands towards another in a relation, such as that of father and son [i.e., saving the state by betraying your relative]. To save the State from harm is an unconditional duty, to save an individual is only a conditional duty, namely, provided he has not been guilty of a crime against the State. The information given to the authorities may be given with the greatest reluctance, but it is given under pressure of necessity, namely, moral necessity.

             But if a shipwrecked man thrusts another from his plank to save his own life, and it is said that he had the right of necessity (that is, physical necessity) to do so, this is wholly false. For to maintain my own life is only a conditional duty (that is, if it can be done without crime), but it is an unconditional duty to not take the life of another who does not injure me, nay, does not even bring me into danger of losing it.

**READING 2: STUCKENBERG ON** **KANT’S EMOTIONLESS MORALITY**

_Introduction: In the selection below, John Henry Stuckenberg, one of Kant’s early biographers, criticizes Kant’s approach to morality for placing value solely in the rational choices of our free will with no regard to our emotions._

Kant declares that there is nothing good in the world, except the good will. Not only does he emphasize this, but he also gives it a strictly literal application to morality. The good will is one which acts purely from regard for the moral law; and this will alone, and not culture, nor endowments, nor emotions of any kind, makes a man good. An act may conform to the [moral] law without being moral; it is moral only when it is done for the sake of the [moral] law. If a man is honest from [legal] policy, not from regard for the [moral] law, his honesty is legal, not moral. Neither is that benevolence moral which springs from pity for the suffering, not from regard for the [moral] law, and he says in his _Foundations for the Metaphysics of Morality_:

It is a duty to be charitable when one can; and many souls are so sympathetic that, without any other motive of vanity or selfishness, they find an inward joy in spreading joy, and they take pleasure in the satisfaction of others as far as it is their work. But I declare that in such a case these acts, however dutiful, however lovely they may be, have no real moral worth; but they are to be classed with other inclinations, as, for instance, with the desire for honor when it agrees with what is generally beneficial and dutiful, and therefore is also honorable and deserving of praise and encouragement, but not of esteem; for the maxim lacks moral worth, which does not do such deeds from inclination, but because it is a duty to do them.

Kant supposes the case of a man who is so much absorbed in his own grief that the calamities of others do not touch him. If now he relieves others solely from duty, without any inclination, [according to Kant] "only then has the deed genuine moral worth." He seems to describe himself in the following:

Suppose nature had put but little sympathy into the heart of a person. Suppose he, an honest man, were from temperament indifferent and cold toward the sufferings of others, perhaps because he is furnished with the special gift of patience and persevering endurance with respect to his own, and also expects and even demands the same of others. Suppose nature had formed such a man (who would truly not be her worst product) not specially for a philanthropist. Would not he, nevertheless, find in himself a source of much greater worth than that which springs from a kind temperament? Certainly. Just there the worth of that character begins which is moral and without comparison the highest, namely, the character which does good from duty, not from inch nation.

Not only does he want to banish all emotions, even the higher ones, from morality, but he also fails to mediate between duty and feeling; the two are separated by a gulf which he leaves fixed and impassable. Disciples and great admirers of Kant have regarded his system as defective in this respect, and could not agree with him that the noblest feelings are a hindrance to morality. and some of the Kantian moralists, especially Schiller, have attempted to mediate between the emotions and morals, and to introduce soul as well as conscience into his cold and stern and heartless morality.

             [Friedrich] Bouterwek says, "Let it be remembered that no so called “feeling-philosophy” found an entrance into Kant's cold understanding, and that all sentimentality, even the noblest, was disagreeable to him." [Friedrich] Rink says that a physician wrote to Kant in 1794: "My dear Professor! Mr. Kant's rational faith is a faith entirely free from all hope. Mr. Kant's morality is a morality entirely free from all love. The question now arises, Wherein does Mr. Kant's faith differ from the faith of devils? And in what respect does Mr. Kant's morality differ from the morality of devils?" In other letters the same [i.e., Rink] twitted him on the lack of the emotional element, and in one he says, " Animals have no reason. The absence of reason is the cause why animals cannot rejoice that there is a God, and that God is so gracious as He is. But it is a mystery to me what the cause can be that my rational brother, Immanuel Kant cannot, or will not, rejoice, just as well as I do, that God is as gracious as He is."

**INTRODUCTION**

Some years ago, 38-year-old Karla Faye Tucker became the first woman executed in the State of Texas in over 130 years. A former drug addict and prostitute, Tucker and a friend ended a three-day drug binge by attempting to steal a young man’s motorcycle. They broke into the man’s apartment and killed him and a visiting woman friend with a pickax. Afterward, Tucker bragged that she got a thrill from the murders. She and her accomplice were caught a month later and ultimately sentenced to death. As her execution date approached, she gained worldwide notoriety because of her unique situation as a woman on death row, her newly found religious conviction, and her paradoxically warm personality. The Pope himself made a public appeal for clemency. Tucker herself believed that her life should be spared since she had reformed to the point that she was no longer part of society’s crime problem but part of the cure. In an interview two weeks before her execution, she explained:

I can witness to people who have been on drugs or into prostitution or into all of that, and they’ll listen to me because they know I understand and can relate to them. And I can keep them from going down that road, because I can let them know. I changed. You can too. [Larry King Live, January 31, 1998]

Clemency was not granted, and the execution took place as planned.

             Tucker argued that her life should be spared since her remaining alive would serve the greater social good. Her reasoning strategy was utilitarian in nature. Most generally, utilitarianism is the moral theory that an action is morally right if it serves the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. To determine whether Tucker should have been executed, the utilitarian would have compared the total good resulting from her execution with the total good resulting from her remaining alive. Tucker believed that more good would result if she remained alive. However, defenders of capital punishment also use utilitarian reasoning and argue that the greater social good is served by executing some criminals. After her execution, a relative of one of Tucker’s victims said, in utilitarian fashion, “The world’s [now] a better place.” Presumably, executing criminals such as Tucker sends a strong signal to other would-be criminals and deters them. It also assists in the psychological healing process of victims and their families.

             Utilitarians believe that the _sole_ factor in determining an action’s morality is the balance of social good versus social evil. Appeals to moral intuitions, social traditions, or God’s wishes are not relevant. Utilitarianism has a long history, but the most famous versions of the theory emerged in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, particularly in the hedonistic utilitarianism championed by Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill. Hedonism involves pleasure seeking, and hedonistic utilitarians argue that morality is determined according to how much pleasure or pain is produced from a course of action. For example, on the issue of capital punishment, hedonistic utilitarians would argue that this practice is justified only if it produces a greater amount of pleasure than pain. Other nonhedonistic versions of utilitarianism emerged in later years. In this chapter we will examine the development of the utilitarian theory and some of the problems that it faces.

**THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF UTILITARIANISM**

Utilitarianism is not the invention of any single philosopher, and the general theory is as old as ancient Greece. The Greek philosopher Epicurus (341–270 BCE) gives a clear statement of the role of pleasure in moral judgments:

We affirm that pleasure is the beginning and end of the good life. We recognize pleasure as the first good, being natural to us, and it is from pleasure that we begin every choice and avoidance. It is also to pleasure that we return, using it as the standard by which we judge every good. [_Letter to Menoeceus_]

Pleasure is clearly an important motivator in our lives, and most moral philosophers find at least some place for pleasure within their theories. What is distinct about Epicurus’s theory of hedonism, though, is that the gaining of pleasure and the avoidance of pain is the _single_ standard by which we determine happiness and thereby judge our actions. Ultimately, Epicurus’s theory did not take hold, and in the centuries following Epicurus, moral philosophers emphasized the roles of virtue, natural law, and the will of God. But humanist philosophers of the Renaissance revived Epicurus’s theory, and by the eighteenth century, several philosophers were defending the pleasure criterion of morality.

**Eighteenth-Century Contributions**

Scotch-Irish philosopher Francis Hutcheson (1694–1747) offered this systematic formula linking morality with happiness:

That action is best, which procures the greatest happiness for the greatest numbers; and that worst, which, in like manner, occasions misery. [_An Inquiry Concerning Moral Good and Evil_ (1725), 3.8]

Here and in his other ethical writings, we find most of the key elements of utilitarianism. First, in Hutcheson’s words, we are to _compute_ the consequences of our actions. Second, Hutcheson identifies the standard of moral evaluation as the greatest amount of happiness or pleasure that results for all people affected. Third, he provides details about the range of consequences that count; long-term, short-term, direct, and indirect consequences all enter into the computation. Finally, he provides details about what counts as happiness or pleasure: Higher intellectual pleasures and lower bodily pleasures are relevant, but with varying degrees of intensity and duration.

             Influenced by Hutcheson, David Hume (1711–1776) further developed this theory. Hume argues that, when we survey what people commonly consider to be moral conduct, we must conclude that morally right actions are those that produce useful or immediately pleasing consequences for ourselves or others. Hume uses the term _utility_ in reference to the useful consequences, and it is from Hume’s expression that later commentators coined the term _utilitarianism_. Two features are unique to Hume’s theory. First, as criteria of moral evaluation, the useful longer-term consequences of actions are as important as the immediately pleasing consequences of actions. Sexual chastity, for example, is morally proper primarily because it has useful long-term consequences in holding together the family unit. The second unique feature of Hume’s theory is that some actions are useful only when followed _as a rule_. Again, with sexual chastity, isolated instances of sexual fidelity will not have the consequence of holding together family units. Hume believes that, to have useful consequences, chastity needs to be followed as a rule, even by single women who are past childbearing age. In Hume’s words:

A single act of justice [or chastity], considered in itself, may often be contrary to the public good; and it is only the concurrence of mankind, in a general scheme or system of action, which is advantageous. [_A Treatise of Human Nature_ (1739-1740), 3.3.1]

Hume’s reasoning here is the foundation of what was later called _rule-utilitarianism_, that is, morality involves examining the pleasurable and painful consequences of the moral _rules_ that we adopt. By the end of the eighteenth century, dozens of prominent moral theorists, influenced by Hume’s theory of utility, proposed similar views. The most important of these theorists was British philosopher Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832), who acknowledged Hume as his immediate source of inspiration.

**Bentham’s Utilitarian Calculus**

Bentham presents his theory of utility in his _Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation_ (1789), which he wrote as a kind of moral guidebook for legislators as they make public policy. Although the bulk of this work focuses on issues of criminal conduct, the opening chapters systematically describe how utility is the ultimate moral standard for all actions. Bentham states his principle of utility here:

By the principle of utility is meant that principle which approves or disapproves of every action whatsoever, according to the tendency which it appears to have to augment or diminish the happiness of the party whose interest is in question: or, what is the same thing in other words, to promote or to oppose that happiness. I say of every action whatsoever; and therefore not only of every action of a private individual, but of every measure of government. [_Principles of Morals and Legislation_ (1789), 1.2]

Two features of Bentham’s theory make it especially unique. First, Bentham offers a bare-bones moral theory consisting of only one factor: the pleasing or painful consequences of actions. Although earlier theorists put forward the basic elements of utilitarianism, they also incorporated non-utilitarian doctrines into their moral theories. Some of these extraneous doctrines are that morality is ultimately founded on the will of God, that sympathy is needed to counterbalance human selfishness, that virtues underlie our moral actions, that we rationally intuit our duty, and that we judge conduct through a moral sense. For Bentham, some of these doctrines are nonsensical, and the rest are irrelevant. His rejection of these more traditional elements of moral theory gave utilitarianism the reputation of being Godless, impersonal, skeptical, and relativistic.

             The second and most important feature of Bentham’s theory is his method for precisely quantifying pleasures and pains, better known as the _utilitarian calculus_. He argues that the complete range of pleasing and painful consequences of actions can be quantified according to seven criteria: (1) intensity; (2) duration; (3) certainty; (4) remoteness, that is, the immediacy of the pleasure or pain; (5) fecundity, that is, whether similar pleasures or pains will follow; (6) purity, that is, whether the pleasure is mixed with pain; and (7) extent, that is, the number of people affected. In a footnote to a later edition of the Principles, Bentham summarizes these criteria in a rhyme, which he says might assist us in “lodging more effectually, in the memory, these points”:

Intense, long, certain, speedy, fruitful, pure --

Such marks in pleasures and in pains endure.

Such pleasures seek if private by thy end:

If it be public, wide let them extend.

Such pains avoid, whichever by they view:

If pains must come, let them extend to few.

[_Principles of Morals and Legislation_, 4:2]

             Bentham is very explicit about how the calculus works. For example, if we wanted to determine the morality of executing Karla Faye Tucker, we would first calculate, one at a time, all of the pleasure and pain that she _personally_ would receive from the execution. One specific pleasure/pain that she would experience would involve her contemplating her own death. As she sat in her cell and thought about the fact that she would soon die, she undoubtedly had a strong painful experience of dread. According to Bentham’s calculus, we need to construct a pleasure/pain chart that takes into account the first four criteria listed previously. We also need to assign numerical values to these factors, perhaps on a scale of 1 to 10. In Tucker’s case, we might get these figures:

                                     Pleasure           Pain

Intensity:                     0                       10

Duration:                     0                       2

Certainty:                     0                       10

Immediacy:                 0                       10

Concerning the intensity of her pleasure/pain, we may presume that Tucker derived no pleasure from the events immediately surrounding her death, and she experienced very intense emotional pain at the prospect of losing her life. The duration of the emotional pain would have been relatively brief, but also certain and immediate.

             After we chart out the first four factors, we then consider the other three factors separately. Bentham’s purity factor involves whether an act produces both pain and pleasure. We’ve already taken this into account in our chart by noting that Tucker experienced only pain and no pleasure. The fecundity factor involves any similar long-term residual pleasures and pains that might result from an action. Since Tucker’s execution was carried out successfully, there were no residual pleasures and pains for her. However, if her execution had been botched on its first attempt and she had to go through the process again a month later, then we would need to devise another pleasure/pain chart for the new execution. Our chart quantifies only the psychological anguish that Tucker experienced when contemplating her own death. However, there were other distinct pleasures and pains that she experienced regarding her execution. For example, she would have been distressed at being permanently separated from her family and frustrated with the criminal justice system. For each of these additional pains or pleasures, we need additional pleasure/pain charts.

             Finally, Bentham’s extent factor involves all the pleasures and pains experienced by other people. So, once we fully account for Tucker’s pleasures and pains, we then construct similar pleasure/pain charts for each pleasure and pain experienced by _each person_ affected by Tucker’s execution. This includes the pleasures experienced by people who wanted Tucker dead, such as the victim’s relatives and those who commiserated with the relatives. But it also includes the pains experienced by those who wanted her alive, such as Tucker’s own relatives, and even those like the Pope who oppose capital punishment and are pained by another execution. At this stage, thousands and perhaps millions of pleasure/pain charts would be involved. We then take the combined pleasure score from all charts and compare it to the combined pain score from all charts. If the pleasure column has the higher score, then executing Tucker is moral. But if the pain column has the higher score, then the execution is immoral.

             When Bentham’s _Principles_ first appeared, two book reviewers attacked the work for the excessive detail throughout his entire discussion. The _Analytical Review_ charged that “perhaps the love of discrimination has been sometimes carried too far, and been productive of divisions and subdivisions of little use to a legislator” (Vol. 5, 1789). The _Critical Review_ commented more strongly that “long and intricate discussions end in trifling conclusions; affected refinement sometimes stands in the place of useful distinctions, and the parade of system is so highly labored as frequently to disgust” (Vol. 68,1789). Bentham was well aware of this overall problem with the _Principles_, and for that reason he delayed its publication for nine years. The problem with his utilitarian calculus in particular is that it imposes a precision on a subject that does not allow for it. Working through even a single example shows that it is virtually impossible to do a complete utilitarian calculus, and this constitutes the strongest argument against it.

             In spite of the problems with Bentham’s theory, his view of utilitarianism gained a following. By the mid-nineteenth century, his name was so strongly linked with utilitarianism that one commentator felt compelled to remind people that Bentham did not _invent_ the doctrine (Simon Laurie, _On the Philosophy of Ethics_, 1866). The next great step in the development of utilitarianism came with British philosopher John Stuart Mill (1806–1873).

**MILL’S UTILITARIANISM**

Bentham was John Stuart Mill’s godfather and teacher, and the young Mill was strongly influenced by his mentor’s account of utilitarianism. In early adulthood, Mill suffered an emotional breakdown, which he attributed to his heavily analytic education. When Bentham died shortly thereafter, Mill felt free to reevaluate the ideas of his upbringing. Mill’s early writings show a growing disenchantment with Bentham’s overly technical utilitarian calculus. In his 50s, Mill finally took the opportunity to write a popular defense of utilitarianism to counter the excessively scientific reputation the doctrine had obtained through Bentham. This appeared in three installments in _Fraser’s Magazine_ in 1861 and was published in book form in 1863 under the title _Utilitarianism_. Because Mill’s _Utilitarianism_ was written in a brief and popular format, one early commentator noted that he expected Mill to follow up with a “longer and more elaborate” book on the subject. But Mill never did. Within a decade, several studies appeared analyzing virtually every aspect of Mill’s theory, and by the turn of the century, Mill’s book became, as one commentator said, “more universally familiar than any other book in the whole literature of English Utilitarianism.”

             Commentators argue that there is little in Mill’s theory that is completely original. In fact, we can outline many features of Mill’s theory simply by listing their similarities to those in previous theories. First, like Bentham, Mill presents a bare-bones account of utilitarianism by not incorporating traditional moral concepts such as the will of God, virtues, a moral sense, or rational intuition. Mill does, though, find a place in his theory for socially oriented moral feelings such as sympathy, which give people the motivation to pursue general happiness. Without such motivation, utilitarianism would be a sterile principle without any practical value.

             Second, like Bentham, Mill believes that the sole criterion of morality is general happiness— that is, the maximum pleasures and the minimum pains that a society of people can experience. Third, like Bentham, Mill believes that this criterion can be expressed somewhat scientifically in the form of a single principle:

Actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness; wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness. [_Utilitarianism_, 2]

Fourth, like Hutcheson, Mill argues that happiness consists of both higher intellectual pleasures, and lower bodily pleasures. Fifth, like Hume, Mill focuses on the good or bad consequences that emerge from _rules_ of conduct, and as such, Mill is classified as a rule-utilitarian.

             The two features of his theory that distinguish him most from Bentham are and his views of higher pleasure and his rule-utilitarianism, which we will look at in more detail.

**General Happiness and Higher Pleasures**

The first distinguishing feature of Mill’s utilitarianism is his differentiation between higher intellectual pleasures and lower bodily pleasures. Although Hutcheson also made this general distinction, Mill develops the notion and makes it central to his theory. Mill introduces the topic as a response to the specific criticism that utilitarianism is a doctrine worthy only of swine since swine, too, pursue pleasure. Mill responds that the concept of pleasure includes intellectual as well as bodily pleasures, and pigs clearly cannot experience intellectual pleasures:

Human beings have faculties more elevated than the animal appetites and, when once made conscious of them, do not regard anything as happiness which does not include their gratification. . . . It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. [_Utilitarianism_, 2]

Lower pleasures traditionally include those from food, sex, self-gratification, and other base instincts. By contrast, higher pleasures are those derived from music, art, and other more lofty intellectual accomplishments. According to Mill, higher pleasures are _qualitatively_ superior to lower pleasures insofar as they are more highly valued even when limited in number. For Mill, Bentham erred by attempting to determine total happiness by assigning numerical values to pleasures and pains, with no regard for their qualitative differences. An early commentator wrote that Mill’s emphasis on higher pleasures established a “new utilitarianism” since higher pleasures are subjective and thus cannot be objectively quantified (Simon Laurie, _Notes_, 1868). For Mill, then, we cannot technically have a utilitarian calculus in which we tally numbers that represent differing quantities of pleasures and pains.

             Although we cannot calculate general happiness in the way that Bentham describes, Mill nevertheless tried to offer some objective standard for ranking the comparative value of differing pleasures. Specifically, Mill presents a test for determining whether one pleasure is qualitatively superior to another. Take, for example, the pleasures that we may experience from visiting an art museum versus attending a monster truck rally. Assume first that an impartial judge is acquainted with both events. The pleasure from the museum visit will be qualitatively superior if (1) the judge prefers the museum visit to the truck rally, (2) the museum visit is accompanied by some pain, such as a two-hour drive, and (3) the truck rally is quantitatively superior, such as a four-night truck-o-rama in contrast with a two-hour museum visit. Mill believes that an impartial judge will prefer the higher pleasure to the lower because we all have a sense of dignity, at least initially. People sometimes choose the lower pleasure since it is easy to kill our more noble feelings, and we often do not have the opportunity to keep our intellectual tastes alive:

Men lose their high aspirations as they lose their intellectual tastes, because they have not time or opportunity for indulging them; and they addict themselves to inferior pleasures, not because they deliberately prefer them, but because they are either the only ones to which they have access or the only ones which they are any longer capable of enjoying. [_Utilitarianism_, 2]

In short, according to Mill, higher pleasures are (1) the main ingredients of general happiness, (2) grounded in our intellectual abilities, (3) qualitatively superior to lower pleasures, (4) spawned by our sense of dignity, and (5) vulnerable to neglect.

**Rule-Utilitarianism**

The second feature of Mill’s theory that is distinct from Bentham’s concerns the place of moral rules in moral decision making. Bentham is what scholars today call an act-utilitarian, whereas Mill is a rule-utilitarian. The two approaches may be defined this way:

• Act-utilitarianism: morality involves examining the pleasurable and painful consequences of our individual _actions_.

• Rule-utilitarianism: morality involves examining the pleasurable and painful consequences of the moral _rules_ that we adopt.

Act-utilitarianism involves a two-tiered system of moral evaluation: (1) selecting a particular action, and (2) evaluating that action by appealing to the criterion of general happiness. For example, according to act-utilitarianism, it would be wrong for me to steal my neighbor’s car since this particular act would produce more general unhappiness. Rule-utilitarianism, though, involves an intermediary step and so is a three-tiered system of moral evaluation: (1) selecting a particular action, (2) evaluating that action by appealing to moral rules, and (3) evaluating moral rules by appealing to the criterion of general happiness. For example, according to rule-utilitarianism, it would be wrong to steal my neighbor’s car since this act would violate the rule against stealing, and we endorse the rule against stealing since it promotes general happiness.

             Mill develops his view of rule-utilitarianism in reaction to two distinct issues. The first concerns whether we have enough time to calculate the consequences of our actions before performing them. Throughout the day there are countless actions that we perform, and it would be completely impractical to perform a utilitarian cost-benefit analysis beforehand on each one. Some of these actions are urgent and require quick decisions. Should we help rescue someone from drowning? Should we call the police when witnessing an assault? But even with less urgent actions, they are so numerous that it would become a bureaucratic nightmare to evaluate the general happiness of each one. A simple act such as selecting toothpaste may involve a pleasure-pain calculus of purchasing one toothpaste brand versus another. Also, could I justify spending my time watching TV, which benefits no one but me, rather than doing volunteer work for a charity group which will benefit many other people? It seems that virtually every action that we perform might require some pleasure-pain analysis, which would be humanly impossible to carry out.

             According to Mill, the above problem arises only for act-utilitarians who attempt to evaluate the general happiness of each action. For rule-utilitarians, though, the problem disappears. With each choice that we face throughout the day, we simply follow the moral rules that society has already established for us. For Mill, “the whole past duration of the human species” has consisted of efforts to learn through experience which types of actions bring about general happiness. Those well-established rules, then, are the guides for our behavior. Society has already determined that as a rule we should help others in need. Thus, we instantly know that we should try to rescue someone from drowning and call the police when we see an assault. Society has also determined that not every decision in our lives rises to the level of moral urgency, and some are matters of personal preference. There are no established moral rules that regulate what toothpaste we purchase or the leisure activities that we engage in, such as watching TV. We would not be promoting general happiness by making hard-and-fast rules about these decisions. Instead, general happiness would be better served if we endorsed a rule that allows each of us a range of free activity.

             The second issue behind Mill’s rule-utilitarianism involves how we resolve moral dilemmas. As noted, according to Mill we appeal to the utilitarian principle only to establish moral rules, but not to judge the morality of individual actions. However, on rare occasions we may be caught in a moral dilemma between two conflicting rules. Suppose I borrow your gun and promise to return it when you ask for it. The next day, you have a dispute with your boss and, in a fit of rage, ask for the gun back. I am now caught in a dilemma between two conflicting moral rules: I should keep my promises, yet I should not contribute to the harm of others. In such rare cases, I can determine the proper course of action by appealing _directly_ to the utilitarian principle to see which rule has priority. Mill explains this point here:

We must remember that only in these cases of conflict between secondary principles [that is, rules] is it requisite that first principles [of general happiness] should be appealed to. There is no case of moral obligation in which some secondary principle is not involved . . . [_Utilitarianism_, 2]

In this case, I bring about more happiness by following the rule to avoid harming others, and so I should hold onto your gun. Thus, the only time we should directly examine the consequences of an individual action is settle a conflict between conflicting rules.

             To summarize, these are the main points of Mill’s utilitarianism:

• General happiness is the sole criterion of morality, and “happiness” is defined as pleasure.

• Higher intellectual pleasures are more valuable than lower bodily pleasures.

• We cannot quantifiably calculate which rules produce the greatest pleasure, although we can objectively determine whether one pleasure is higher than another.

• We appeal to the principle of greatest happiness only when evaluating rules of conduct, and not individual actions.

**CRITICISMS OF UTILITARIANISM**

Early defenders of utilitarianism offered their theories as radical alternatives to the more conventional approaches to morality that emphasized God, natural law, and instinctive duties. From the start, utilitarian theories were challenged by more conventional theorists. We will look at four important criticisms of utilitarianism.

**Gisborne’s Criticism: We Cannot Know All of the Consequences**

One of the first criticisms of the utilitarian theory was presented by English clergyman Thomas Gisborne (1758–1846). According to Gisborne, we are incapable of knowing all of the consequences of our actions. As we attempt to hunt down the various consequences, we will never be in a position to discover all of the relevant effects and form a conclusion about the overall happiness or unhappiness that results. He offers a picturesque analogy for this point:

As well might a fisherman infer, that his line, which has reached the bottom of the creek in which he exercises his trade, is therefore capable of fathoming the depths of the Atlantic. . . . He, who has had sufficient humility to become convinced. . . how few are the consequences which he can foresee, compared with those which are wrapped in obscurity, will be the most ready to confess his ignorance of the universal effects of his actions. [_The Principles of Moral Philosophy Investigated_ (1789)]

Imagine that I use a 15 foot line to fish in a local creek, and with that I can reach its bottom. I then conclude that this same 15 foot line would be sufficient for me to fish in the depths of the Atlantic Ocean, which, obviously, it is not. By analogy, in our ordinary lives we are good at figuring out some of the immediate consequences of our actions. If I break a cup, it will cost me $5 to replace. If I set my alarm clock to the wrong time, then I’ll be late for work the next day. However, this skill in discovering immediate consequences of ordinary actions does not equip us to discover all the long term effects of many of our other actions. If I steal my neighbor’s car, can I really say with certainty that the consequences, when all tallied, will produce more unhappiness than happiness? It may well be that my neighbor did not like his car and would prefer the insurance money that he’d get when reporting it stolen. It may well be that the police catch me and send me to jail, which in turn reforms me and makes me a more productive and responsible citizen. I just do not know what all the remote consequences will be. In Gisborne’s words, “the limited knowledge of expediency attainable by the wisest of men is unfit to be adopted as the basis of moral rectitude” (ibid).

             How might the utilitarian respond to Gisborne’s criticism? Rule-utilitarians like Mill have the easiest answer. When determining the rightness or wrongness of moral rules, like “do not steal,” it is never up to a single individual to calculate all the consequences. Through trial and error over many generations, our ancestors have experienced and evaluated the long term results of all sorts of actions. They kept records of these in stories and histories, and constructed laws to minimize the unhappy consequences that some courses of actions bring about. We are the beneficiaries of these efforts, and we can safely say that adopting a rule like “do not steal” will bring about more long term happiness than unhappiness. It makes no difference whether we as individuals lack the mental vision to detect all the remote consequences of our actions. Like so many other areas of our lives, we rely on cultural tradition to teach us lessons that we could not individually discover.

             But even the act-utilitarian has some response to Gisborne. Let’s grant that I as an individual have a limited ability to envision all the long term consequences of a given action, like stealing my neighbor’s car. Nevertheless, nature has provided me with enough foresight to assist me in planning my life and my community. The ability to project the consequences of actions is a critical survival skill. While I cannot literally see into the future to evaluate all the remote consequences of my actions, I can set up scenarios that are more likely than others. If I steal my neighbor’s car, it is not really likely that he’ll be happy about it and prefer the insurance money. I can also project that I’ll likely get caught and go to jail. And, even if I reform in prison, that experience is not likely to improve my life when I get out, but will instead permanently restrict my career options. I also know my act of theft will place a burden on my family, the insurance industry and the criminal justice system. In the end, I can make a good best guess that my act of theft will produce more unhappiness than happiness. This is not a 100% foolproof assessment, but it’s good enough for me to make a reasonable assessment of how I should morally behave. It is also not that much different than other critical decisions that I make in my life that are not strictly speaking moral ones. When choosing to accept a job offer, I try to make a reasonable cost-benefit analysis based on the limited knowledge that I have. So too with decisions about marrying someone, buying a home, and having children. Whether my actions are morally significant or morally neutral, nature has not left me helpless when it comes to projecting their most likely long term consequences.

**Bradley’s Criticism: Utilitarianism Conflicts with Ordinary Moral Judgments**

A second criticism of utilitarianism, presented by British philosopher F. H. Bradley (1846–1924), is that utilitarian moral judgments often conflict with our ordinary conceptions of moral obligation. For example, it is theoretically possible that you cheating on your spouse will maximize general happiness. It may make you and your lover happy, and as long as you keep it a secret, your spouse will not be unhappy. But even in this situation our ordinary moral judgment is that adultery is wrong:

Let us take the precept, Do not commit adultery. How are we to prove that no possible adultery can increase the overplus of pleasurable feeling? . . . To put the whole matter in to words; the precepts of Hedonism are only rules, and rules may always have exceptions: they are not, and, so far as I see, they can not be made out to be laws. [_Ethical Studies_ (1876), 3]

According to Bradley, there are morally proper behaviors that “we should choose even if no pleasure came from them,” such as being faithful to one’s spouse. Thus, utilitarianism fails as a guideline of proper conduct.

             We can illustrate Bradley’s point further by considering cases in which we might exploit someone if doing so would produce general happiness. For example, suppose that I capture and enslave an unimportant person who has no relatives, and force him to perform all the menial tasks that I and my family hate. We have him clean the house, do the laundry, mow the yard, change the cat litter box, fix broken appliances, and so on. The slave surely suffer, but, overall, this results in more happiness with me and my family through the slaves’ labor. However, we commonly feel that it is simply wrong to enslave someone, in spite of the overall happiness that this might produce. According to Bradley’s reasoning, then, utilitarianism is an inadequate moral theory since it can be used to justify this kind of exploitation in the name of general happiness.

             In response to Bradley’s criticism, again, rule-utiltarians have the easiest job of providing an answer. According to rule-utilitarians such as Mill, we do not calculate the consequences of each action, such as whether general happiness is maximized when Jones in particular cheats on his wife. Instead, we calculate the consequences of each _rule_ we adopt, such as “adultery is wrong.” As Hume argued, it is only through the adoption of this general rule against adultery that we maximize social utility by better preserving the family unit. So too with exploitive acts like slavery. We do not calculate the benefit of enslaving Jones in particular, but, instead, the benefit of rules like “Slavery is wrong.” When we focus on these rules, it becomes clear that adopting them will produce more happiness than unhappiness. Further, rule-utilitarians can safeguard against all isolated acts of exploitation, and not just slavery, by adopting a  rule like “We may never exploit individuals, even for an alleged greater good.” Even if some instances of exploitation do serve the general happiness, most exploitation will result in unhappiness. So, a rule prohibiting all exploitation will be one that, on balance, serves the general happiness.

             Act-utilitarians also have a response to Bradley’s criticism. When utilitarian reasoning conflicts with ordinary moral judgments, it is often because we focus only on the short-term benefits of one’s conduct, neglecting the long-term ones. In the situation of adultery, there is the realistic possibility that one’s spouse will eventually find out, or that one’s lover may feel taken advantage of and take revenge. With slavery there is the long term problem of slave rebellions, and creating an underclass of people that society may never fully recover from even after slavery is outlawed. In fact, the long-term negative consequences of slavery in the United States are still unfolding. The problem that Bradley exposes is not so much with act-utilitarianism itself, but with human nature and our tendency to prefer short term benefits over long term ones. It was much easier for slave owners to focus on the immediate economic benefits of slavery than the long term social and economic devastation that it would create. While the focus on long term consequences may not resolve all of utilitarianism’s conflicts with ordinary moral judgments, it goes a long way in reducing the force of Bradley’s criticism.

**Grote’s Criticism: Utilitarianism Only Perpetuates the Status Quo**

Suppose we wanted to determine whether an action like the execution of Karla Faye Tucker is morally permissible. According to utiltarians, we find this out by looking at how much pleasure and pain result from actually putting people to death. This involves an experiential inspection of the various consequences—an approach that, in essence, grounds morality in our factual observations. In his posthumously published _An Examination of the Utilitarian Philosophy_ (1870), John Grote (1813–1866) criticizes this purely experiential approach to determining our moral obligations. For Grote, appeals to experience will only perpetuate the status quo, and it will not include an ideal moral goal toward which we should aim. There is no room for anyone with special moral vision to expose the flaws with our current moral standards and put us on the path to moral reform. In Grote’s words, utilitarianism bases morality only on what _is_ the case, not on what _ought to be_ the case. Morality should include guidelines for moral improvement, but we will never get such guidelines by appealing only to what is the case. Grote makes this point here:

Man has improved as he has, because certain portions of his race have had in them the spirit of self-improvement, or, as I have called it, the ideal element; have been unsatisfied with what to them at the time has been the positive, the matter of fact, the immediately utilitarian; have risen above the cares of the day. . . [_An Examination of the Utilitarian Philosophy_ (1870), 13]

According to Grote, to obtain ideal guidelines, we need an intuitive knowledge of morality, which goes beyond mere experience and a utilitarian analysis.

             There are two distinct aspects of Grote’s criticism: (1) whether utilitarianism would ever allow standards of morality to shift beyond the status quo, and (2) whether utilitarianism has any room for people with special moral vision. Utilitarians have a response to both of these aspects. Regarding the first, imagine an isolated village where nothing ever changes. The population is stable and they have consistent growing seasons with no unpredictable droughts or insect infestations. There have been no technological advances in hundreds of years, and work routines are firmly established. Their political structure is stable, with no conflicts between social groups. There is no contact with outsiders who might introduce foreign customs or pose threats of war. In this situation, there would be no utilitarian grounds to move morality beyond the status quo. The village’s customs and moral values evolved around a fixed and unchanging social environment, and no additional experience would require a new assessment of what will bring about the greatest happiness for the greatest number. For this particular village, Grote is correct: utilitarianism would only perpetuate the status quo. However, very few societies are like this today, and probably have not been since the dawn of human civilization. Within most societies, there are continual changes as a result of population fluctuations, natural disasters, epidemics, clashes with foreigners, new technologies, social inequalities, political factions, and differing religions. Where there is constant change within societies, there will always be a need to reexamine which actions and policies bring about the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. Some tried and true moral rules will never change, such as “do not kill” and “do not steal.” But others may shift with the times such as with capital punishment, abortion, euthanasia, cloning, church and state relations, universal health care, internet neutrality and a host of other hot button issues that divide society. Where there is heated debate, the status quo is not fixed, and there is a need to draw on utilitarianism to make society a happier place.

             The second aspect of Grote’s criticism—whether utilitarianism has any room for people with special moral vision—can be answered with a similar response. Within the isolated village described above, moral visionaries seeking to reform the status quo would only be troublemakers who would risk disrupting the efficient traditions of that past. In spite of their good intentions, their efforts at reform might produce more unhappiness than happiness. Again, in this village Grote is correct: utilitarianism has no room for the moral visionary. However, when we turn to societies that are ever-changing with constant social clashes, there is an important role for utilitarian moral visionaries. They are the ones who propose new ideas for mediating social conflict and bringing about the greatest happiness for the greatest number. A key theme throughout Mill’s _Utilitarianism_ is that, over time, the status quo of general happiness will improve through education and science. The moral visionary is the one who brings these new social ideas to the public and attempts to gain consensus with them. The visionary will not seek guidance from an inner and intuitive sense of morality, as Grote suggests. Instead, the visionary will seek out areas of discontent within society and propose ways of remedying it. Some discontent will be so overwhelming that it may call for radical changes to set society on a long-term path of general happiness. The abolition of slavery and the civil rights movement are cases in point, and the leaders of these movements could fully justify their reforming efforts with utilitarian reasoning.

**Albee’s Criticism: Higher Pleasures are Inconsistent with Hedonism**

A final criticism focuses specifically on Mill’s version of utilitarianism. We saw that the most distinctive feature of his theory is that happiness consists of both higher and lower pleasures, and that higher pleasures are qualitatively superior to lower ones. The problem is that Mill appears to offer two separate standards of general happiness: (1) pleasure and (2) dignity. If we see pleasure as the sole criterion, then we must deemphasize dignity; if we see dignity as the principal criterion, then we must deemphasize pleasure. American philosopher Ernest Albee (1865–1929) concisely states the central issue here:

The inconsistency, in truth, may be expressed in a word: If all good things are good in proportion as they bring pleasure to oneself or others, one cannot add to this statement that pleasure itself, the assumed criterion, is more or less desirable in terms of something else (e.g., human dignity) which is not pleasure. [_A History of English Utilitarianism_ (1902), 12]

The problem here is a serious one, and it appears that Mill simply cannot hold up both pleasure and dignity as the principal standard of happiness.

             One option is to set aside the notion of dignity, and simply to see pleasure as the standard of happiness. This solution brings Mill closer to Bentham, since any difference between pleasures would then have to be quantitative. This even allows for the possibility of a utilitarian calculus of differing quantities of pleasure. However, this resurrects the problem that Mill hoped to avoid—namely, that utilitarianism is a doctrine worthy only of swine since swine also pursue pleasure. Thus, this is not the best option for Mill. The very uniqueness of his version of utilitarianism rests on the concept of higher pleasure, and, so, we must try to answer Albee’s criticism while preserving that concept.

             A second option is to redefine the notion of human pleasure to make it inseparable from the notion of human dignity. That is precisely what Mill tried to do when distinguishing between higher and lower pleasures. The lower ones are bodily in nature, which even animals can experience. By contrast, the higher ones are uniquely human and involve human dignity. The challenge for Mill is to explain how a pleasure can be a dignifying one, and still be an actual “pleasure” in any meaningful sense of the word. His slogan “It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied” does not help his case since it looks like the human being is not experiencing any real pleasure at all. It is here that Mill needs help.

             To assist Mill with this problem, let’s start by considering a common distinction between pain and suffering. Suppose that both I and my pet hamster break a leg as a result of an accident. We both will experience physical pain from our respective injuries. However, I, with my more complex brain, will reflect on my pain in ways that the hamster cannot. I’ll worry how long the pain will last, how long it will take to heal, whether I’ll be able to function normally when it does heal, and whether I’ll be treated differently by my peers throughout the healing process. What I am experiencing now is not just pain, but suffering. The specific formula is pain plus reflection produces suffering. While suffering of this sort may not be a uniquely human experience, it would at best be restricted to higher animals sophisticated thought processes.

             Consider now how I and my hamster would react to a pleasurable experience of, say, eating our favorite meal. The hamster eats its food pellets and I eat a pizza. We both experience gastronomic pleasure, but, because of my more sophisticated thought process, I reflect on it in different ways. I think about the subtle interplay of ingredients, the manner in which it was cooked, its visual appearance, how it compares to other pizzas I’ve had, and what beverage would go well with it. I also think about how many calories I’m eating, whether the ingredients are processed or whole foods, and how it fits into a balanced diet for the day. While my gastronomic pleasure is similar to that of the hamster, my overall enjoyment of the experience is entirely different since it is filtered through my higher thought processes. At least some of this thought process involves a sense of dignity. I’m not simply shoveling food into my mouth to satisfy a craving, but by reflecting on these additional elements I am elevating the experience to a level that fits into my sense of human worth. The formula here is ordinary pleasure plus reflection produces higher pleasure. Now I do not always do this when I eat pizza, and sometimes my experience is no better than a hamster’s. But, on the occasions that my eating enjoyment is connected with my higher functions, my experience is more valuable. With a sense of human adventure, I might expand beyond my usual eating routine and try different foreign foods and enjoy them. Similarly, I might expand beyond the action-adventure movies that I watch and try foreign films and documentaries, and enjoy them as well. In all of these cases, the higher pleasure that I’m experiencing is a genuine pleasure that is rooted in an ordinary pleasure, such as good eating, drama, suspense, intrigue, romantic passion. But as it becomes elevated to a higher pleasure, it cannot be separated from my human dignity. In this way, contrary to Albee, higher pleasures are not inconsistent with hedonism.

**LINGERING PROBLEMS WITH UTILITARIANISM**

The utilitarian strategy for moral decision making has withstood the test of time and this in and of itself demands that we take it seriously. We’ve examined four major criticisms against it, and in each case utilitarians have a plausible response. In this final section we will consider two lingering problems with utilitarianism, one of which questions whether pleasure is the only important moral value, and the other that questions whether any bare-bones utilitarian formula can function as the sole authority in moral judgments.

**Pleasure is Not the Only Important Moral Value**

Bentham and Mill’s hedonistic utilitarianism is a mixed bag. On the plus side, by focusing exclusively on the _pleasure_ that results from a course of action, morality stands up to experiential and even scientific judgment. Hedonistic utilitarians argue that we can record experiences of pleasure, quantify degrees of pleasure, and use this as the basis of our moral judgments. Scottish economist Francis Edgeworth (1845-1926) proposed the idea of a hedonimeter that could scientifically measure the pleasure that a person was experiencing:

Let there be granted to the science of pleasure what is granted to the science of energy, to imagine an ideally perfect instrument, a psychophysical machine, continually registering the height of pleasure experienced by an individual, exactly according to the verdict of consciousness. . . . . [_Mathematical Psychics_ (1881), Appendix 3]

Such a machine has not yet been created, but, even today, many philosophers and social scientists defend hedonistic utilitarianism because of its objectivity. Books in microeconomics routinely include chapters on techniques for numerically measuring utility. For the hedonistic utilitarian, then, moral assessment is not a matter of personal feelings or intuitions. Instead, it attempts to place the issue of morality squarely in the arena of public observation.

             The minus side of hedonistic utilitarianism, though, is that, as critics point out, pleasure is not the only thing in life that is morally significant. Religious and political martyrs are vivid illustrations of this. Many people throughout history have felt morally compelled to defend their religious or political ideals knowing full well that they would be tortured and ultimately killed for their actions. Their lives would have been more pleasurable—or at least far less painful—if they had simply conformed to social expectations. It seems, then, that an important part of our moral assessments goes beyond mere pleasure.

             Mill himself acknowledged that mere pleasure is not the only thing that counts, and as we’ve seen, he addressed this problem with the notion of higher pleasures. Perhaps Mill would say that martyrs experience higher pleasures that counterbalance their pains. To more successfully address this problem, some contemporary defenders of utilitarianism abandon pleasure altogether as the ultimate criterion and propose instead a standard that is broad enough to include cases like religious and political martyrs. The two most popular alternatives are ideal utilitarianism and preference utilitarianism.

             Ideal utilitarianism is the view that the morally right course of action is the one that brings about the greatest amount of _goodness_, regardless of what we specifically identify as good. Many things in life are intrinsically good, such as aesthetic beauty, integrity, friendship, fulfillment of desires, fairness, and freedom. However, we should not single out any one of these qualities as definitive, which is exactly what Bentham and Mill did by focusing on pleasure. According to British philosopher G. E. Moore (1873–1958), it is actually _impossible_ for us to pinpoint all of the qualities that constitute absolute goodness:

It is just possible that the Absolute Good may be entirely composed of qualities which we cannot even imagine. This is possible, because, though we certainly do know a great many things that are good-in-themselves, and good in a high degree, yet what is best does not necessarily contain all the good things there are. [_Principia Ethica_ (1903), 6.11]

Rather than focusing on a specific quality, such as pleasure, we should instead recognize that _any_ consequence that counts as good needs to be entered into the utilitarian tally. Suppose I live in a repressive country and am considering voicing my unpopular political opinions. I not only tally the pain I will experience from being tortured, which is clearly bad, but also tally the assertion of my freedom and the integrity of my convictions, which are good things. How do we recognize the various things that count as good? Moore argues that we should start by pointing out the flaws in popular standards of goodness that leave out important goods. Moore concludes that the ideal standard we arrive at will emphasize a mixture of aesthetic enjoyments, such as beauty, and admirable mental qualities, such as sociability. Ultimately, we must rely on intuition to recognize the various goods.

             Preference utilitarianism is the view that the morally right course of action is the one that maximizes our _preferences_. Again, if I live in a repressive country and am considering expressing my unpopular political opinions, I would tally my preference for free expression in addition to the pain I would experience from being tortured. Preference utilitarianism is most associated with contemporary British philosopher R. M. Hare (_Moral Thinking_, 1981_)_. There are three key aspects to Hare’s account. First, to say that I “prefer” something simply means that I would choose that thing if the appropriate situation arose. For example, to say, “I prefer that Karla Faye Tucker be executed,” means that I would choose in favor of her execution if I had the chance. Second, my preferences include a combination of both immediate and long-term preferences. Among other combinations, it includes (1) what I prefer right now to attain right now, (2) what I prefer right now to attain in the future, and (3) what I will prefer in the future to attain in the future. Third, my preferences are not merely restricted to myself but also include the preferences of other people. That is, some of my preferences must be impartial and universal, and I must imagine what my preferences would be if I were in someone else’s shoes. For example, I would _not_ prefer that, if I were Tucker, I should be executed. But I _would_ prefer that, if I were a relative of the victim, Tucker should be executed. According to Hare, I need to tally my own preferences for myself and weigh them against what I’d prefer if I were other parties involved. If my preferences focused only on myself, then I would be an egoist, and not a utilitarian.

             Both ideal utilitarianism and preference utilitarianism allow us to tally a broad range of possible consequences in our utilitarian calculus. Contrary to hedonism, they recognize that pleasure is not the only thing that counts. However, ideal and preference utilitarians pay a price for being so inclusive— namely, they lose objectivity. As mentioned earlier, according to hedonistic utilitarians, pleasure can be experientially measured. But, ideal goodness and personal preferences _cannot_ be experientially measured. These are founded in gut feelings and private intuitions, which do not lend themselves to public inspection, and is precisely what Bentham was trying to avoid. Consequently, many utilitarians stick with the old hedonistic version in spite of its narrowness.

**Problems with the Bare-Bones Utilitarian Formula**

Utilitarians from Bentham and Mill onward are united in the view that morality is a matter of weighing the positive versus the negative consequences of a course of action. We described this earlier as a _bare-bones_ concept of morality, which does not involve other considerations such as virtues, God’s will, natural law, or natural rights. Utilitarian writers present different claims about the purpose of the bare-bones utilitarian formula. They sometimes see it as (1) a description of how we _actually_ make moral decisions or (2) a description of how we _should_ make moral decisions or (3) a quick and easy test to use in making moral decisions. But no version of utilitarianism is successful in any of these claims.

             First, utilitarianism does not accurately describe how we _always_ make moral decisions, as we can see from the Karla Faye Tucker story. Although both sides of the dispute at some point offered utilitarian reasoning for their views, they also appealed to a variety of non-utilitarian reasons. Tucker herself believed that, as a matter of simple mercy, society should forgive criminals who reform. Her critics argued that she should be executed based on an “eye for an eye” notion of justice. Appeals to simple mercy or to eye-for-an-eye justice do not involve utilitarian tallies of good or bad consequences. Also, utilitarianism involves a type of arithmetic by which we subtract the weight of the negative consequences from the weight of the positive ones. Those calling for Tucker’s execution appear to have simply dismissed the positive consequences of her staying alive. That is, they did not subtract the positive consequences from the negative ones, as a true utilitarian would.

             Second, it is not clear that we _should_ adopt the utilitarian formula when making all of our moral decisions. Kant made this point specifically with regard to capital punishment. Although Kant himself defended the death penalty, he argued that, if we execute a criminal because of its positive value for society, such as crime deterrence, then we are using the criminal as a tool for our own purposes. For Kant, it is always bad to use someone as a tool, even if the person in question is a criminal (_Metaphysics of Morals,_ 1797).

             Third, in many if not most cases, the utilitarian formula is neither a quick nor an easy way of making moral decisions. It is difficult to see how many people might be affected by a given course of action. It is also difficult to know how to assign weight to the various good or bad consequences that emerge. Although hedonistic utilitarians brag that pleasure can be experientially quantified, the fact remains that scientists have not yet invented a pleasure meter. Assigning weight to pleasures and pains will still involve some level of subjective judgment.

             Perhaps the problem with utilitarianism is its bare-bones claim that morality depends _entirely_ on calculations of consequences. Philosophers today are drawn to simple formulas and to simple explanations for complex philosophical puzzles. But moral decision making appears to be one area that we cannot account for with a simple, unified formula. Our actual moral decision-making process depends on a patchwork of various theories and explanations that cannot be reduced to a single theme. At times, we do rely on utilitarian reasoning, and, to that extent it is an important part of moral decision making. Utilitarians merely need to abdicate their claim to sole authority.

**Summary**

Many philosophers as far back as ancient times believed that pleasure is the standard by which we should judge moral conduct. Philosophers during the 18th century refined this notion, and, with Bentham, we find the classic statement of hedonistic utilitarianism. According to Bentham, we determine whether an action is right by calculating all of the pleasure and pain that results from that action. Mill offered a version of utilitarianism that parted company with Bentham in two important ways. First, he emphasized the difference between higher and lower pleasures, where the higher ones are more important and are incapable of numerical computation. Second, Mill offered a version of rule-utilitarianism holding that we test only the general happiness of moral rules, not that of each action.

             We next looked at four criticisms of utilitarianism, the first of which by Gisborne is that we will never be able to discover all of the relevant effects of our conduct. Next, Bradley criticized that utilitarianism conflicts with common moral values; for example, with utilitarianism, we could justifiably commit adultery or enslave someone if doing so maximized the general happiness. Grote criticized that utilitarianism locks us into the morality of the status quo and does not account for moral progress. Albee criticized that Mill inconsistently holds to two standards of moral value: pleasure and dignity. Finally, we looked at two lingering problems with utilitarianism. The first is whether pleasure is the only important moral value. Ideal utilitarians such as Moore recommend that we tally the total good versus bad that results from a course of action. Preference utilitarians such as Hare recommend that we assess our total preferences regarding a course of action. The second lingering problem concerns whether any bare-bones utilitarian formula can function as the sole authority in moral judgments.

**READING 1: MILL ON HIGHER PLEASURES**

_Introduction: The unique feature of Mill’s version of utilitarianism is his distinction between higher and lower pleasures, where higher mental pleasures are more important than lower bodily ones. He explains his position in the following selections. It may not always be easy to recognize when a pleasure that we pursue is a higher or lower one, but he offers a procedure for distinguishing between the two, and explains further that the underlying source of higher pleasures is our human sense of dignity. He also discusses why people often reject higher mental pleasures in favor of lower bodily ones._

**Higher and Lower Pleasures**

The creed which accepts, as the foundation of morals, Utility, or the Greatest Happiness Principle, holds that actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness. By happiness is intended pleasure and the absence of pain; by unhappiness, pain and the privation of pleasure. To give a clear view of the moral standard set up by the theory, much more requires to be said; in particular, what things it includes in the ideas of pain and pleasure, and to what extent this is left an open question. But these supplementary explanations do not affect the theory of life on which this theory of morality is grounded—namely, that pleasure and freedom from pain are the only things desirable as ends; and that all desirable things (which are as numerous in the utilitarian as in any other scheme) are desirable either for the pleasure inherent in themselves, or as means to the promotion of pleasure and the prevention of pain.

             Now, such a theory of life excites in many minds (and among them in some of the most estimable in feeling and purpose) inveterate dislike. To suppose that life has (as they express it) no higher end than pleasure—no better and nobler object of desire and pursuit—they designate as utterly mean and groveling; as a doctrine worthy only of swine, to whom the followers of Epicurus were, at a very early period, contemptuously likened. And modern holders of the doctrine are occasionally made the subject of equally polite comparisons by its German, French, and English assailants.

             When thus attacked, the Epicureans have always answered, that it is not they, but their accusers, who represent human nature in a degrading light, since the accusation supposes human beings to be capable of no pleasures except those of which swine are capable. If this supposition were true, the charge could not be gainsaid, but would then be no longer an imputation; for, if the sources of pleasure were precisely the same to human beings and to swine, the rule of life which is good enough for the one would be good enough for the other. The comparison of the Epicurean life to that of beasts is felt as degrading, precisely because a beast’s pleasures do not satisfy a human being’s conceptions of happiness. Human beings have faculties more elevated than the animal appetites; and, when once made conscious of them, do not regard anything as happiness which does not include their gratification. I do not indeed consider the Epicureans to have been by any means faultless in drawing out their scheme of consequences from the utilitarian principle. To do this in any sufficient manner, many Stoic as well as Christian elements require to be included. But there is no known Epicurean theory of life which does not assign to the pleasures of the intellect, of the feelings and imagination, and of the moral sentiments, a much higher value as pleasures than to those of mere sensation. It must be admitted, however, that utilitarian writers in general have placed the superiority of mental over bodily pleasures chiefly in the greater permanency, safety, uncostliness, etc., of the former—that is, in their circumstantial advantages rather than in their intrinsic nature. And, on all these points, utilitarians have fully proved their case; but they might have taken the other, and, as it may be called, higher ground, with entire consistency. It is quite compatible with the principle of utility to recognize the fact that some _kinds_ of pleasure are more desirable and more valuable than others. It would be absurd that (while in estimating all other things, quality is considered as well as quantity) the estimation of pleasures should be supposed to depend on quantity alone.

**The Test for Higher Pleasures and the Sense of Dignity**

If I am asked, what I mean by difference of quality in pleasures, or what makes one pleasure more valuable than another (merely as a pleasure, except its being greater in amount) there is but one possible answer. Of two pleasures, if there be one to which all or almost all who have experience of both give a decided preference, irrespective of any feeling of moral obligation to prefer it, that is the more desirable pleasure. If one of the two is, by those who are competently acquainted with both, placed so far above the other that they prefer it, even though knowing it to be attended with a greater amount of discontent, and would not resign it for any quantity of the other pleasure which their nature is capable of, we are justified in ascribing to the preferred enjoyment a superiority in quality, so far outweighing quantity as to render it, in comparison, of small account.

             Now it is an unquestionable fact that those who are equally acquainted with, and equally capable of appreciating and enjoying both, do give a most marked preference to the manner of existence which employs their higher faculties. Few human creatures would consent to be changed into any of the lower animals, for a promise of the fullest allowance of a beast's pleasures. No intelligent human being would consent to be a fool, no instructed person would be an ignoramus, no person of feeling and conscience would be selfish and base, even though they should be persuaded that the fool, the dunce, or the rascal is better satisfied with his lot than they are with theirs. They would not resign what they possess more than he for the most complete satisfaction of all the desires which they have in common with him. If they ever fancy they would, it is only in cases of unhappiness so extreme, that to escape from it they would exchange their lot for almost any other, however undesirable in their own eyes. A being of higher faculties requires more to make him happy, is capable probably of more acute suffering, and certainly accessible to it at more points, than one of an inferior type. But in spite of these liabilities, he can never really wish to sink into what he feels to be a lower grade of existence.

             We may give what explanation we please of this unwillingness. We may attribute it to pride, a name which is given indiscriminately to some of the most and to some of the least estimable feelings of which mankind are capable. We may refer it to the love of liberty and personal independence, an appeal to which was with the Stoics one of the most effective means for the inculcation of it; to the love of power, or to the love of excitement, both of which do really enter into and contribute to it. But its most appropriate appellation is a sense of dignity, which all human beings possess in one form or other, and in some (though by no means in exact) proportion to their higher faculties, and which is so essential a part of the happiness of those in whom it is strong, that nothing which conflicts with it could be, otherwise than momentarily, an object of desire to them. Whoever supposes that this preference takes place at a sacrifice of happiness—that the superior being, in anything like equal circumstances, is not happier than the inferior—confounds the two very different ideas of happiness and content. It is indisputable, that the being whose capacities of enjoyment are low has the greatest chance of having them fully satisfied. And a highly endowed being will always feel that any happiness which he can look for, as the world is constituted, is imperfect. But he can learn to bear its imperfections, if they are at all bearable; and they will not make him envy the being who is indeed unconscious of the imperfections, but only because he feels not at all the good which those imperfections qualify. It is better to be a human being dissatisfied, than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied, than a fool satisfied. And if the fool or the pig are of a different opinion, it is because they only know their own side of the question. The other party to the comparison knows both sides.

**Why People Reject Higher Pleasures**

It may be objected that many who are capable of the higher pleasures, occasionally (under the influence of temptation) postpone them to the lower. But this is quite compatible with a full appreciation of the intrinsic superiority of the higher. Men often, from infirmity of character, make their election for the nearer good, though they know it to be the less valuable, and this no less when the choice is between two bodily pleasures than when it is between bodily and mental. They pursue sensual indulgences to the injury of health, though perfectly aware that health is the greater good. It may be further objected, that many who begin with youthful enthusiasm for everything noble, as they advance in years sink into indolence and selfishness. But I do not believe that those who undergo this very common change voluntarily choose the lower description of pleasures in preference to the higher. I believe that before they devote themselves exclusively to the one, they have already become incapable of the other. Capacity for the nobler feelings is in most natures a very tender plant, easily killed, not only by hostile influences, but by mere want of sustenance; and, in the majority of young persons, it speedily dies away if the occupations to which their position in life has devoted them, and the society into which it has thrown them, are not favorable to keeping that higher capacity in exercise. Men lose their high aspirations as they lose their intellectual tastes, because they have not time or opportunity for indulging them; and they addict themselves to inferior pleasures, not because they deliberately prefer them, but because they are either the only ones to which they have access, or the only ones which they are any longer capable of enjoying. It may be questioned, whether any one, who has remained equally susceptible to both classes of pleasures, ever knowingly and calmly preferred the lower; though many in all ages have broken down in an ineffectual attempt to combine both. . . .

**READING 2: LESLIE ON UTILITARIANISM**

_Introduction: The following selection by Irish economist Thomas Edward Cliffe Leslie (1825-1882) discusses objections to Mill’s version of utilitarianism. Leslie first maintains that the common objections to utilitarianism fail, and he shows how utilitarians might respond to various counter-examples. Second, however, he argues that utilitarianism ultimately fails because it cannot successfully function as a one-size-fits all formula for determining moral value. Rather, increasing happiness or usefulness is only one of many things that are valuable. Moral progress, he maintains, is one of our most cherished values, and is even more valuable to us than utilitarian happiness._

**Failure of Common Objections to Utilitarianism**

The common objections to the doctrine [of Utilitarianism] must, in fairness, be admitted to be weak.

             For example: when [French philosopher] M. Victor Cousin says that the ideas of justice and expediency [i.e., benefit]—if they often go together—are sometimes opposed, he instances the answer of Aristides to the proposal of Themistocles, to burn the ships of the allies in the port of Athens to secure supremacy to the Athenian State.  “The project would be expedient [i.e., beneficial for Athens],” said Aristides; “but it is unjust.” The Utilitarian denies that it would have been expedient, even for the interests of the Athenians themselves, [since it would serve] to establish a precedent for treachery toward confiding neighbors and friends, and to make the citizen of Athens, wheresoever he went, the object of suspicion, retaliation, and cunning and cruel surprises.

             Or, again, when it is argued that a piece of furniture, or any other inanimate object, may be useful, yet that no one ascribes to it moral rectitude or virtue, and that it follows, that intention and not utility is the criterion of morality, the Utilitarian fairly replies that things without feeling are not fit objects, however useful, for gratitude or indignation, for reward or punishment, because they cannot feel either, and neither is therefore expedient; because such things tend to do harm as well as good, to hurt or inconvenience as well as to do service; and because no praise or censure bestowed upon senseless matter tends to make the class to which it belongs contribute to the happiness of life. In the Utilitarian estimate intention is of great importance, because of its consequences or tendencies.

             The Utilitarian blames a small act of malignity [i.e., cruelty], not in proportion only to the actual pain it causes, but to the general mischiefs to which malignity tends. He does not, on the other hand, blame a person who sets fire to a house by reading in bed, as he does an incendiary [i.e., an arsonist]; because the general tendency of midnight study is wholly different from that of vindictiveness and treachery; and because, again, the reader in bed is not so likely to burn the house by accident as the person who tries to do so of malice intent. Yet the former is blamed according to the doctrine of utility, and blamed just in proportion to the probability that his negligence will do harm: if he reads by a perfectly safe light, he is not blamed at all.

             Or take a higher example. “At the cavalry combat at El Bodon, a French officer raised his sword to strike Sir Felton Harvey, of the 14th Light Dragoons; but, perceiving that his antagonist had only one arm, he stopped, brought down his sword before Sir Felton in the usual salute, and rode on.” Was this proceeding right or wrong? The first duty of a citizen is to his country, and of an officer to his army. War, too, is not a duel, and the combat ants do not measure their swords. Sir Felton Harvey had not lost his head, and the head of an officer is more dangerous to an enemy in battle than his arm. The Frenchman, therefore, ought, it seems, to have cut him down. Yet the Utilitarian would admit that the magnanimous [i.e., generous] intention alters the character of the act, because it is of supreme importance to human happiness that a spirit should exist among the strong to spare the weak, and that even enemies should show mercy and courtesy to each other.

             Take yet another case. It has been argued that the negroes in America are happier as slaves than as free laborers, and, therefore, upon Utilitarian principles, slavery is not a crime. [Let’s set aside the obvious fact] . . . that a view of slavery which looks only at the slave at play instead of at work (that is, in his moments of liberty, so far as it goes), supplies evidence only [i.e., entirely] in favor of liberty. . . .  [Nevertheless, a] just Utilitarian estimate of slavery includes not only the consequences of oppression and debasement to the slave, but also the consequences to his master of the possession of tyrannical power and ill-gotten gain, and the consequences to the world at large of an empire being founded on the principle that the strong may lawfully trample on the weak.

**Moral Progress more Valuable than Utility**

Every step in the progress of civilization has by no means been attended by an increase of human happiness; yet the step was a thing desirable in itself, irrespective of ultimate ends. . . . If the good man would not choose the lower and more animal life, however pleasant, either for himself or for mankind, does it not seem that the summum bonum [i.e., highest moral good] and the aim and end of virtue is what disciplines and ennobles humanity, and elevates it more and more above the condition of the brute, rather than what may serve to annihilate most pains and provide most pleasures? Is not the progressive improvement of living creatures the best purpose the world seems to contain or disclose?

             The chief quality in the character of virtue is, in truth, not usefulness, but excellence, rarity, nobleness. If all men were benevolent, and equally so, benevolence would not be thought of as a virtue. The pecuniary value of things in the market depends, not on their utility, but on their comparative scarcity, difficulty of attainment, and superiority; and so the moral worth of actions and qualities is estimated by their rare and peculiar merit and extraordinary dignity and sublimity, rather than their pleasure-giving effects. What we most admire in man is what sets him above the brute; and what we most' admire and approve in men is ascent above their fellow-men in. intellectual and moral rank; and these sentiments of admiration and esteem supply ample motives to sacrifice pleasure to improvement, and tend to make the standard or criterion of virtue the tendency to elevate and ennoble human nature rather than to promote the happiness of human life. . .

             But different theories of life must, in this world of mystery and doubt, present themselves to different minds, and the just weight to be attached to earthly happiness can be determined by no human measure. It is in itself a good, but not the sole good. And, in truth, it seems that, as on the one hand the moral sense is not a single sentiment, but a plurality of affections, emotions, and ideas, of different complexion in different ages and different men, so there is no sole and universal criterion either of virtuous actions or of human good. We love, approve, admire, respect, and venerate different qualities respectively; and virtue is, in short, not an abstract name of a single attribute, but a noun of multitude, which includes not only the useful and the loveable, but the exalted, the excellent, the noble, and the sublime, and the beautiful to the eye of the soul. All virtue aims, indeed, at human good; but human good seems manifold. It is innocent pleasure and innocent escape from pain, but it is also improvement; it is enjoyment, but it is also discipline, energy, and action. And, if a conflict should arise between the two, if the progressive should become less happy than the stationary state, the virtuous man may be expected to make the choice of Hercules both for himself and for others.

             The great changes which have taken place, however, in the moral sentiments of successive generations of mankind, and in their estimates of the worth of qualities and actions, might in reason warn us from attempting to fix forever the standard and ideal of virtue, or to determine the aims of life for all future generations. It was held in ancient Rome, “that valor is the chiefest virtue,” and humanity would then have been held nearly akin to vice. So it seems not for us to make certain that our present theories of the right and good are not dwarfed by the imperfection of our sentiments and our knowledge. For this reason alone the claims of Utilitarianism to be received as "a comprehensive formula, including all things which are in themselves good," would seem open to question. The moral progress of mankind is in itself a good, which makes the final determination of the summum bonum improbable; and it is too in itself a good which is probably better than happiness.

**INTRODUCTION**

A monkey was electrocuted while walking across electrical wires at a railway station in India. When it fell unconscious onto the tracks, a fellow monkey worked relentlessly for 20 minutes to revive it by shaking, biting, and hitting it, then dunking it into water. Eventually the injured monkey regained consciousness and the two walked away together. The entire episode was caught on video, and the compassion displayed by the assisting monkey was not only touching, but recognizable as the type of moral behavior that humans express toward each other. In fact, if there was a similar video of a human working desperately for 20 minutes to revive an electrocuted person, we would describe it as a heroic effort worthy of the highest moral praise, and we would expect the two to be interviewed on TV talk shows.

             The story of the morally heroic monkey is not just interesting, but it raises questions about whether human morality has a foundation within biology and brain chemistry that we also share at least in part with other social animals. This raises further questions about how human morality may have advanced beyond that of other social animals during our evolutionary and biological history. These are questions that traditional moral philosophers have ignored, either because animal and evolutionary science was not available to them, or because it was irrelevant to their conceptions of morality. According to most traditional philosophers, morality involves a choice to follow a set of rational moral standards that universally apply to all people. Even the brightest animals don’t have that mental capacity, nor did many of our evolutionary ancestors. Thus, according to the traditional view, we can ignore what scientists say about animal morality and human evolution, and for that matter we can ignore most anything else that biological science attempts to tell us about morality.

             Is this traditional picture of biology and ethics correct? In this chapter, we will look at some of the research in this area, and see if philosophical theories of morality need updating to incorporate scientific insights.

MORAL BEHAVIOR IN ANIMALS

The example of the monkey reviving his companion is dramatic, but by no means rare. A chimpanzee named Washoe rescued another chimp from drowning in a mote surrounding their zoo enclosure. A gorilla named Binti Jua protected a three-year-old boy who had fallen into its enclosure by growling at other gorillas who approached the boy until zoo keepers could intervene. A stray dog pulled an injured dog to safety across a busy highway. These are all accidental incidents that were caught on camera and became news stories. But in the past few decades there has been a surge of research on animal morality that have involved carefully devised experiments. Part of the challenge with these studies is setting up and conducting the experiments themselves, and the other part is interpreting what these experiments mean about morality for both animals and humans. We’ll look at each of these challenges.

Experiments on Animal Moral Behavior

When philosophers think about morality they focus on thought processes, such as the moral intuitions that we have, moral principles that we should follow, or the moral reasoning procedure that we go through. For a scientist, though, these would be difficult to study even in human test subjects since they rely so much on our hidden thoughts, and would be all the more so in animals since there is a language barrier between human scientists and animals that cannot be overcome. Thus, scientific studies of morality look at animal behavior, which is publicly observable and testable. Experiments can be devised that place animals in morally relevant situations and then see how they respond. While there is no master list of observed behaviors that count as morally relevant, animal researchers commonly focus on conduct that involves cooperation, sharing, fairness, and empathy.

             Let’s start with a classic cooperation and sharing experiment from 1937.1 Picture this: Two chimpanzees are inside of a cage, and outside there is a tray of food with two ropes attached, which the chimps can pull to bring the food closer. But the tray is too heavy for one chimp alone to pull, so both are needed to perform the task. How do they do? The chimps not only cooperate by both pulling the ropes, but they learn to pull at the same time, which speeds up the task. In a variation of this experiment, one chimp was fed in advance and had no desire to retrieve the food on the tray. Still, he assists the unfed chimp, but only reluctantly. The unfed chimp keeps tapping him on the shoulder and gesturing at the food to make him participate. Thus, the hungry chimp understands that it needs help, and the fed chimp is willing to help even though it does not want the food. In a recent replication of this experiment, cooperation improved when the two chimps had already been in a social relationship in which they shared food.

             In another cooperation and sharing study,2 Chimp-1 is locked in a cage in which it can only be unlocked from outside the door. Chimp-2, who never met Chimp-1, is outside the cage and free to run around. Food is then placed outside the cage that only Chimp-2 can access. Does he eat it all himself? No: he unlocks the door so that Chimp-1 can also have some. The implication is that Chimp-2 understands the need to assist Chimp-1 in accessing the food, and he does so even if it is to his disadvantage. A similar study was conducted with rats.3 Rat-1 is trapped inside a plexiglass tube with a door that opens only from the outside. Rat-2 is free to run around and was not taught how to open the door to the tube. Rat-2 figures out how to open the door, goes inside, and pulls Rat-1 out. In a variation of this experiment, Rat-2 is given a choice between freeing Rat-1 or accessing chocolate chip treats from another tube. Surprisingly, Rat-2 first frees Rat-1 and gets some of the treats from the other tube for himself, but then leaves some for Rat-1 to eat.

             Here is one more sharing study from 2011 by **Frans de Waal, one of the leading researchers on animal morality.** Chimp-1 is given a choice between two differently colored tokens: a selfish token where he alone will get a food reward, and a prosocial token where both Chimp-1 and Chimp-2 will get a reward. When Chimp-2 is not present, Chimp-1 selects the selfish token around 45% of the time. But when Chimp-2 is present, Chimp-1 selects the prosocial token around 60% of the time, and when Chimp-2 is present and draws attention to himself, selection of the prosocial token rises to around 65% of the time.

             Consider now an influential experiment on fairness also conducted by **de Waal. Two monkeys are in separate cages. If a monkey hands the researcher a small stone, then that monkey will receive a piece of cucumber as a reward. Both monkeys happily perform the task for their respective reward. Now, however, Monkey-1 receives a grape that is a more appealing reward, while Monkey-2 still receives the cucumber. Monkey-2 immediately protests by shaking his cage and throwing the cucumber back at the researcher. In some repeats of this experiment, Monkey-1 will refuse the grape until Monkey-2 also receives a grape as a reward. Both monkeys not only recognize the unfairness of the differing rewards, but protest until the situation is equalized.** The results of de Waal’s original study have been replicated with dogs, hyenas, elephants, and even birds. In the study on dogs,**4** Dog-1 presented its paw to the researcher when asked, but received no reward. Dog-2 was introduced but received a treat when presenting its paw. Dog-1, still receiving no reward, started whimpering and stopped cooperating.

             Turn next to a study on animal empathy conducted in 19635 where Monkey-1 would have access to food only through a device that caused Monkey-2 to be electrically shocked. The result was that Monkey-1 would frequently avoid accessing the food, in one case for 12 days. In variations of the experiment, monkeys were more inclined to refrain from eating when they themselves experienced the shock. Because of improved standards of animal testing, this experiment could not be performed today, but it shows that monkeys understood the pain that the other was experiencing and avoided causing the pain. De Waal has also conducted studies of empathy in animals and he recounts the story of an old female chimp named Penny with arthritis that could barely walk. Younger chimps would spit water in her mouth to keep her from walking to a distant water source, and would help push her up a climbing frame, no favor returned. De Waal argues further that contagious yawning is evidence of empathy: it activates the same areas of the brain and people or animals who yawn after seeing others do so are more empathetic than those who lack yawn contagion.

             Studies of cooperation, sharing, fairness, and empathy are the primary ones related to animal morality, but other areas of animal sociability are also relevant to the discussion. There is consolation where a male chimpanzee who loses a fight is hugged by a younger chimpanzee, which calms him down and comforts him. There is reconciliation where bonobos, who fought in the morning, had embraced and kissed each other later as a way of repairing the damage caused by conflict. There is social mediation where some chimpanzees become self-appointed mediators to break up fights between other chimps, which improves the social stability of the group. There is elephant mourning where, when an elephant dies, others will cover its body with leaves and grass and stay with the body for a week.

What Animal Studies Show

No doubt, these studies of animal social behavior are interesting and even startling. An ordinary person has limited exposure to animals in their natural settings, especially large-brained mammals like chimpanzees, and these studies increase our understanding of the types of behavior that animals are capable of. But there are many ways of interpreting these studies and drawing comparisons to human moral behavior, and we need to ask a few questions about what exactly they tell us about morality.

             The first question is whether any of these animal behaviors are really examples of what we as humans call morality, or fairness, or empathy. Yes there are remarkable resemblances, but at the same time we have a tendency to give our own characteristics to other things, that is, to anthropomorphize. The ancient Greek philosopher Xenophanes warns us that people everywhere give the gods attributes of humans—their emotions, behavior, and even physical appearance. Descartes gives us a similar warning about how we view animals: yes, they perform cunning tricks, and even have bodies that are similar to ours. But there is no thought behind what they do, he says, and they are only biological robots.

             Animal scientists themselves have fallen into the anthropomorphism trap. During the 1960s and 1970s, several studies were conducted aiming to show that large apes could learn sign language and use it to construct original sentences. The issue was not one of whether apes or other animals could communicate with each other in their own ways. Rather, it was a question of whether they could learn and use human language with grammar. At first, the apes showed great progress and learned around 200 words that they could associate with things. It then appeared that they could string those words together into meaningful sentences. But upon close inspection of videos of the apes, one of the research scientists concluded that the apes were just mimicking their trainers when signing in full sentences. Their abilities never went beyond 200 or so words, which is the limit of human words that a dog or a parrot can recognize and correctly respond to. Thus, what appeared to be a display of a complex human ability turned out to be only a superficial resemblance.

             Perhaps something like this is going on with animal morality. We’ve seen examples of animal rescuing, which look very compelling in their similarity to human behavior. But now consider an experiment on rescuing within ant colonies, which on face value also looks compelling.6 An ant is tied to a piece of paper with nylon thread and half buried in the ground. The ant calls for help and other ants from the colony arrive. They attempt to pull the ant out, discover the nylon thread, then dig down around the ant, and chewed through the thread to finally free the ant. If we witnessed a parallel situation of a half-buried human being rescued by his friends, we’d say that it exhibited sophisticated communication, rational decision making, emotional empathy, and an understanding of moral responsibility. But in this study these are ants, not humans, or even chimpanzees. It is not clear whether ants and similar insects are even conscious, much less capable of the basic components of moral thinking. It could be just instinctive programming triggered by the right type of stimulus. We could conceive of designing a rescue robot that could respond to a series of if-then conditions. If you hear this kind of sound (i.e., a cry for help), then move in that direction. If you see this kind of motion in a person (i.e., struggling to get free) then perform this series of actions. Maybe this is all that is taking place with the rescuing ants.

             The problem of anthropomorphizing animal behavior is a serious one. Perhaps, then, the most cautious interpretation that we can give of the ant experiment is this: among social insects like ants, social behavior is mechanically programmed at an unconscious level.

             A second issue in these animal studies concerns the different layers of social behavior that we see in simple animals like ants on through complex animals like humans. At the ground level are unconscious, mechanically programmed instinctive behaviors (as with ants), and at the top level are behaviors that consciously arise from not only instinct, but emotions, reasoning, rule-following, and tradition. Somewhere in between these two levels is the social behavior of mice, dogs, and chimps. Take, for example, the social behavior of empathy. The following are various types and levels of empathy that researchers have ascribed to animals:

_Prosocial behaviors_: Actions were taken to reduce the distress of an object.

_Cognitive empathy_: The subject has represented the state of the object as a result of the accurate perception of the object’s situation or predicament, without necessary state matching beyond the level of representation.

_Emotional contagion_: Similar emotion is aroused in the subject as a direct result of perceiving the emotion of the object.

_Sympathy_: The subject feels “sorry for” the object as a result of perceiving the distress of the object.

_Empathy_: The subject has a similar emotional state to an object as a result of the accurate perception of the object’s situation or predicament.7

At the lowest level is prosocial behavior, which is the only type of empathy that we can confidently ascribe to rescuer ants: they in point of fact took action to reduce the distress of an object. If ants also have the conscious capacity to mentally represent the world, then the rescuers are also displaying cognitive sympathy, which is one level up. That is, they recognize the buried ant’s predicament without being emotionally affected by it.

             One level higher is emotional contagion, such as when an excited dog will trigger excitement in surrounding dogs; so too with anger and fear. Still higher is sympathy, as when rescuer animals display signs of distress as they fervently try to help their companions. The highest level is empathy where an animal has a similar emotional state with what he observes in another animal. One important study8 showed that mice, which have the ability to make facial expressions, displayed a facial grimace when seeing another mouse in pain. As with humans, facial expressions are a mechanism for publicly displaying one’s inner emotions. The grimace response on a mouse is most likely an indicator of an empathetic experience of the victim’s pain rather than just a sympathetic experience of sorrow. Questions will still remain about how closely animal empathy is to human empathy. The animal will be interpreting the object’s unfortunate situation through its own animal experiences. If I am the object and am lying on the ground with a fractured leg, then the animal may have a lot of empathy for me, but it would have no empathy whatsoever with me if my financial portfolio becomes worthless. But that is also how it works with human beings, and I cannot count on every person to empathize with me in every crisis that I face. The bottom line is that empathy in higher animals may be very similar to empathy in humans.

             Empathy is just one component of morality, and for each of the other social behaviors that animal scientists have investigated—sharing, cooperation, fairness—the same type of analysis is needed. That is, we should first see how it appears at a lower level that is unconscious and purely instinctive, such as with ants, and then compare how it appears within higher animals like dogs or apes, and finally in humans.

             Part of the value of animal morality research is that we learn more about the animals themselves. We see from these studies that animal social behavior is more sophisticated and human-like than we previously knew, and this in turn is an argument for more humane treatment of animals. This is not to say that animals have exactly the same understanding and capacity for morality as humans, which they don’t. Chimpanzees deal with conflict by biting each other, and researchers in the 1970s learned this the hard way during experiments in which they raised chimps within human households as though they were human. Also, agitated mother pigs will sometimes eat their young, which is incomprehensible from the standpoint of human morality. Nevertheless, the similarities with human moral behavior are striking enough to consider re-evaluating the lower moral status that we often ascribe to animals.

             The other part of the value of animal morality research is what it says about human morality. Animals do not acquire their sense of sharing, cooperation, fairness, and empathy by reading philosophers or going to church or reasoning about it: it flows from within their biology. Why should it be any different with humans? Human genes are 99% the same as chimp genes, and we are evolutionarily related to chimps with a common ancestor 6 million years ago. While our morality is more sophisticated, there is still an evolutionary story of how it got that way. In de Waal’s words, “**the building blocks of morality are evolutionarily ancient,”** and we turn to this subject next.

MORALITY AND HUMAN EVOLUTION

Since the days of the common chimp-human ancestor 6 million years ago, there have existed over a dozen different human-like species that have since gone extinct. Some of these were our ancestors, others not. If we could study the evolution of human morality in the most ideal circumstances, we would need to take tribes of each of these early hominid species, examine how their members interact with each other in the wild, and conduct experiments on them just as researchers have done with monkeys and apes. With some of these hominids, they may be similar enough to modern humans so that we could invite them to stay in our guest bedroom; with others, maybe just the backyard. Obviously, though, we can’t have direct encounters with any of these creatures, and our only recourse for learning about them is much more indirect and much less precise. It involves speculating about how social and moral traits might have emerged in early humans through the evolutionary process of natural selection.

How Evolution Works

We begin with the basic elements of the evolutionary process. An examination of fossil records by themselves show that species morphed into other ones over time, but the question for science is how that morphing took place. One explanation, now discredited, is soft-inheritance where a parent supposedly passes on a trait that it acquired during its life. Suppose, for example, that a mouse gets its long tail cut off while running around on sharp rocks; on the theory of soft-inheritance, its offspring could have shorter tails. But a famous experiment showed that after five generations of cutting 900 tails of mice, the length of the newborn mice tails remained unchanged. So much for the theory of soft-inheritance.

             The evolutionary mechanism that science has come to accept is Darwin’s view of natural selection, which he first presented in _On the Origin of Species_ (1859). In its simplest form, natural selection has three steps. First, biological organisms undergo random mutations that are passed on to offspring; in modern terminology, an organism is born with a genetic mutation, and, if it survives and reproduces, its offspring may also have that mutated gene. Second, environmental conditions in the natural world are harsh and do not permit the survival of every organism that comes into existence. Some will starve, others will be eaten, still others will be killed by natural disasters. Third, organisms with the most beneficial mutations in their natural environments will survive and pass that attribute on to their offspring. If a mouse is born with a mutation that makes it brown, while its siblings are all white, the brown mouse might escape the sight of a hungry owl better than the white ones, and thus survive to pass on the trait of brown fir.

             There are different types of natural selection based on the different environmental pressures on an organism, and biologists have found it convenient to give some of them names. Sexual selection is when reproductive success results from an animal being better at securing mates than its rivals. Stronger male birds may gain better access to breeding grounds than weaker males. Female birds may prefer to mate with males that have more elaborate plumage. In both cases there are environmental pressures placed on the male animal’s reproductive success. Kin selection is when reproductive success results from the survival of an animal’s genetic relatives. A mother may fight to the death to protect her offspring rather than flee for her own safety. Thus, the mother seeks to preserve its genes through her children, not through her own continued existence.

Evolutionary Moral Theory vs. Veneer Moral Theory

We turn next to explanations of how human morality may have emerged through the natural process of evolution. There are two general ways of looking at the relation between evolution and morality. One is evolutionary moral theory, espoused by Darwin, which maintains that human morality results from the natural selection process. The other is veneer moral theory, held by Thomas Huxley, which is that morality does not emerge through natural selection, but is a social creation that humans have added on to their evolutionary development. Let’s look at each.

             From the moment Darwin proposed his account of evolution, the idea that human morality emerged through natural selection was a controversial one. Darwin himself delayed publishing on it for a decade, but it finally appeared in _The Descent of Man_ (1871). His position was clear: human morality is the outgrowth of the evolutionary process of natural selection insofar as social instincts aided our ancestors in the struggle for survival. Darwin illustrates this with an example of two hominid tribes competing with each other in the same region:

When two tribes of primeval man, living in the same country, came into competition, if (other circumstances being equal) the one tribe included a great number of courageous, sympathetic and faithful members, who were always ready to warn each other of danger, to aid and defend each other, this tribe would succeed better and conquer the other. . . . A tribe rich in the above qualities would spread and be victorious over other tribes: but in the course of time it would, judging from all past history, be in its turn overcome by some other tribe still more highly endowed. Thus the social and moral qualities would tend slowly to advance and be diffused throughout the world.9

Between the two tribes, the one with social instincts will out-compete the one that lacks them. According to Darwin, the social instincts that early humans acquired are the same as those of other social animals and include parent-child affection, taking pleasure in the company of one’s fellows, sympathy, and giving assistance. But once humans acquired highly developed intellects, those social instincts naturally formed both a moral sense and a conscience: where the former tells us what we ought to do, and the latter motivates us to do the right thing. Through our superior intellects, our social instincts naturally lead to the golden rule, do to others what you would have them do to you, “and this lies at the foundation of morality.” While the mental gap between humans and other animals is immense, Darwin says, the difference is nevertheless one of degree and not of kind. Thus, any social animal that might in time acquire our level of intelligence would also develop a moral sense and conscience like we have. But as it stands now, only humans can be considered moral beings since we are the only creatures who are “capable of comparing his past and future actions or motives, and of approving or disapproving of them.”

             While Huxley was a major defender of the theory of natural selection during the nineteenth century, he held that evolution could not be the source of human morality as Darwin believed. Evolution, Huxley argues, has given us a wide range of behavioral tendencies, some of which are sociable, such as the mutual affection of parent and offspring. Yet evolution has also given us other behaviors that are unsociable, such as an instinct to continually assert ourselves in the struggle for existence at the expense of others. Evolution may thus explain how humans have acquired both our sociable and unsociable tendencies, but it cannot give us a reason for why we should _prefer_ the sociable ones over the unsociable. In fact, he maintains, morality is in opposition to the struggle for existence:

In place of ruthless self-assertion it demands self-restraint; in place of thrusting aside, or treading down, all competitors, it requires that the individual shall not merely respect, but shall help his fellows; its influence is directed, not so much to the survival of the fittest, as to the fitting of as many as possible to survive. It repudiates the gladiatorial theory of existence.10

Moral progress, then, aims at combating evolution: “every child born into the world will still bring with him the instinct of unlimited self-assertion” but “will have to learn the lesson of self-restraint and renunciation.” The history of civilization itself, he argues, is the step-by-step effort “in building up an artificial world within the cosmos.” Within that artificial world, moral precepts “are directed to the end of curbing the cosmic [evolutionary] process and reminding the individual of his duty to the community.” The perfection of human morality has not yet occurred, and indeed may never come. For, our existence on this planet “is the outcome of millions of years of severe training, and it would be folly to imagine that a few centuries will suffice to subdue its masterfulness to purely ethical ends.” In short, Huxley’s view is that morality is something that human society has created by itself as a way of restricting the unsociable instincts that evolution has placed within us.

             In recent years, Huxley’s view has been dubbed the “veneer theory” since he is suggesting that morality is a distinct layer of values that society has placed on top of our evolutionary nature. Key to his position is what we may call Huxley’s problem: We have competing natural tendencies to be sociable in some situations, yet unsociable in others, and natural selection does not recommend one over the other. He vividly illustrates this here:

The thief and the murderer follow nature just as much as the philanthropist. Cosmic evolution may teach us how the good and the evil tendencies of man may have come about; but, in itself, it is incompetent to furnish any better reason why what we call good is preferable to what we call evil than we had before.

If evolution merely instilled in us an incompatible set of impulses, then early humans were indeed left on their own in a miserable condition of conflict. But at some point early humans made a choice: “the first men who substituted the state of mutual peace for that of mutual war, whatever the motive which impelled them to take that step, created society.”11

             What should we think about Huxley’s problem? Darwin himself did not see it as an issue. Rather, Darwin felt that natural selection would give preference to human groups with the strongest social instincts, which would only increase over time and naturally give rise to a moral sense and conscience. Determining whether Darwin or Huxley were right hinges largely on how strong our evolutionary social instincts are and how successful they are in subduing our more selfish and violent impulses. In contemporary discussions of human evolution, this is a question of altruism, which we turn to next.

Evolutionary Explanations of Altruism

Altruism involves acts of putting other people’s interests ahead of our own. I am hungry and I want to eat an apple, but, upon seeing that you are hungry too, I give you the apple instead. This is a mild example of an altruistic act since my life or fortune are not at risk when giving up a single apple. Even a chronically selfish person might occasionally do something like this. But when we consider the impact of habitual altruistic behavior on human evolutionary survival, the issue becomes more critical. I may make sacrifices for others that lead to my own death, such as defending my tribe against invaders, which puts an end to my ability to reproduce. In discussions of human evolution, this is called biological altruism, that is, improving the reproductive fitness of others at one’s own expense. The fact is that humans do make life-threatening sacrifices for others in three groups of people: (1) for our close relatives, which is called kin altruism; (2) for our immediate community, which is called tribal altruism; and (3) for others who are not relatives or immediate community members, which is called indiscriminate altruism. If this is what we in fact do right now, then at some point in our evolutionary history we acquired these capacities. The challenge for evolutionary theory is to explain how each of these three types of altruistic behavior could have arisen through natural selection. In the most extreme cases, altruism is evolutionarily self-defeating since if I sacrifice myself out of altruistic kindness for others, then I cannot pass that altruistic trait on to my children, and thus that altruistic trait would die out.

             Kin altruism is the easiest of the three to link with natural selection. We’ve already noted that a special type of natural selection, called _kin selection_, maintains that reproductive success results from the survival of an animal’s genetic relatives. The stereotype of natural selection is that it is all about the survival of the individual organism—living as long as possible and propagating as much as possible. The concept of kin selection, though, shifts reproductive success away from the individual animal itself and toward that animal’s genes. In essence, my reproductive strategy is accomplished when I have children who will pass on my genes, and it is in my interests to protect them so that they too will reproduce. The strength of maternal and paternal instincts among so many animals is compelling evidence for kin selection.

             Tribal altruism, though, is more difficult to connect with natural selection. I can see why I would prefer the survival of my children over myself since they carry my genes. But why should I sacrifice myself for the guy down the street who does not share my genes? Kin selection will not provide a good answer. Darwin suggested two possible ways of connecting tribal altruism with natural selection. First, we may be selfishly motivated to help others with the understanding that they in the future will help me—essentially, I’ll scratch your back if you scratch mine. Darwin writes, “each man would soon learn that if he aided his fellow-men, he would commonly receive aid in return. From this low motive he might acquire the habit of aiding his fellows.”12 Today this explanation is called reciprocal altruism . His second explanation is that we have a natural instinct of sympathy that was acquired through natural selection. Sympathy, for Darwin, involves my desire to be praised by others and my aversion to being blamed. Even dogs, he argues, “appreciate encouragement, praise, and blame.” Social animals like dogs and humans have a survival edge since they respond to praise or blame from others in the group. Of these two explanations, it is reciprocal altruism that evolutionary theorists accept as the best account for tribal altruism.

             Indiscriminate altruism is even more difficult to connect with natural selection. Why should I risk my life for a total stranger who doesn’t share my genetics or is even part of my community? I gain nothing whatsoever. Richard Dawkins offers a possible explanation: it may be a misfiring of an instinct that in the past increased human survival, but became less critical later. Dawkins gives the example of swimmers who were rescued by dolphins:

This could be regarded as a misfiring of the rule for saving drowning members of the school. The rule’s “definition” of a member of the school who is drowning might be something like: “A long thing thrashing about and choking near the surface.”13

Similarly, if I put my life at risk by saving a stranger from drowning, I might be following a rule that tells me to save members of my tribal community, where the definition of my tribal community might be “other people who are around me.” In an environment with limited tribal population, this would work just fine and simply be an expression of reciprocal altruism. But in the larger environment of towns, cities, and world civilization, where countless strangers are around me, the reciprocal benefit is absent while the altruistic moral impulse remains.

Advantages of Reciprocal Altruism over Pure Altruism

In current discussions of morality and evolution, kin selection and reciprocal altruism seem to be the most plausible explanations of how biological altruism arises. A question might still remain about why reciprocal altruism is a better strategy than pure and unconditional altruism. Imagine that you and I lived in the same tribe and you were instinctively a reciprocal altruist that would only help others who helped you in return. I, on the other hand, was instinctively a pure altruist and would help everyone. Over successive generations, which of these two instincts would come to dominate future members of the tribe, and which would die out? We might think that my characteristic of pure altruism would survive since the tribe would be stronger if all members were kinder and more mutually supportive of each other.

             Dawkins, though, argues that the pure altruism instinct would not survive, and he makes his case with an example from the animal world.14 Birds are afflicted with life-endangering parasites. Because they lack limbs to enable them to pick the parasites off their heads, they—like much of the animal kingdom—depend on the ritual of mutual grooming. It turns out that nature has evolved two basic types of birds in this regard: those who are disposed to groom anyone, and those who refuse to groom anyone except those who present themselves for grooming. The former type of bird Dawkins calls “Suckers” and the latter “Cheaters.”

             In a geographical area containing harmful parasites and where there are only Suckers or Cheaters, Suckers will do fairly well, but Cheaters will not survive because of their lack of cooperation. However, in a Sucker population in which a single mutant Cheater accidentally arises, that Cheater will prosper, and the Cheater-gene type will multiply. As the Suckers are exploited, they will gradually die out. But, if and when Suckers become too few to groom the Cheaters, the Cheaters will start to die off too and eventually become extinct.

             Why don’t birds all die off, then? Well, somehow nature has come up with a third type, call them “Grudgers.” Grudgers groom only those who reciprocate in grooming them. They groom one another and Suckers, but not Cheaters. In fact, once caught, a Cheater is marked forever. There is no forgiveness. It turns out then that unless there are a lot of Suckers around, Cheaters have a hard time of it—harder even than Suckers. However, it is the Grudgers that prosper. Unlike Suckers, they don’t waste time messing with unappreciative Cheaters, so they are not exploited and have ample energy to gather food and build better nests for their loved ones.

             What we see from this bird example is that showing reciprocal altruism to others (as the Grudgers do) is a good strategy for survival, while pure altruism (which the Sucker exemplify) is a failure. Elliott Sober and David Sloan Wilson make a similar point about the benefits of reciprocal altruism with tribal hunters. The hunter spends an enormous amount of time hunting at great risk to himself, but distributes food to the entire group, hunters and non-hunters alike. This seemingly altruistic, group-enhancing behavior, it turns out, is rewarded by the group:

It turns out that women think that good hunters are sexy and have more children with them, both in and out of marriage. Good hunters also enjoy a high status among men, which leads to additional benefits. Finally, individuals do not share meat the way Mr. Rogers and Barney and Dinosaur would, out of the goodness of their heart. Refusing to share is a serious breach of etiquette that provokes punishment. In this way sharing merges with taking. These new discoveries make you feel better, because the apparently altruistic behavior of sharing meat that would have been difficult to explain now seems to fit comfortably within the framework of individual selection theory.15

So, although hunting might at first sight appear an example of pure altruism, the rule of reciprocity comes into play, rewarding the hunter for his sacrifice and contribution to the group.

             This primitive notion of reciprocity seems to be necessary in a world like ours. One good deed deserves another and, similarly, one bad deed deserves another. Reciprocity is the basis of desert—good deeds should be rewarded and bad deeds punished. We are grateful for favors rendered and thereby have an impulse to return the favor; we resent harmful deeds and seek to pay the culprit back in kind (“an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth”).

WHAT IS LEFT FOR TRADITIONAL MORALITY?

With all of this research into animal and evolutionary morality, we need to consider what this means for traditional ethical theory. Should philosophers feel threatened that they will soon be out of the ethics business? It has happened several times before with subjects that were once under the domain of philosophy, such as economics, sociology, and psychology. Centuries ago, even science itself was in the hands of philosophers under the designation “natural philosophy.” Since the time of ancient Greece, philosophy has been an arena of thoughtful speculation, but once a discipline gained a solid empirical foundation, it graduated from philosophy into a natural or social science. Is it time for ethics to move out of the philosophical home of its upbringing and handed over to the scientists? We will look at three positions on this.

Philosophy Only with No Input from Science

The first position regarding the relation between biological science and ethics is that there is not any relation at all. Science is all about facts, whereas morality is about how we ought to behave, as Jerry Fodor argues here.

Why is it so hard for us to be good? Why is it so hard for us to be happy? One thing, at least, has been pretty widely agreed: we can’t expect much help from science. Science is about facts, not norms; it might tell us how we are, but it couldn’t tell us what is wrong with how we are. There couldn’t be a science of the human condition.16

On this view, science can accumulate all the facts it wants about human biology and behavior, but it will never uncover a fact that says “we ought to do such and such.” Further, it can never say “here are the biological facts, and, in view of these, this is how you ought to behave.” This is an example of what philosophers call the fact-value problem, which questions whether values are essentially different from facts and whether moral assessments can be derived from facts.

             We see this fact-value problem at play with both animal morality and the evolution of human morality. With animals, we may concede the zoological fact that animals behave in ways that allow their social groups to run more smoothly. But even if these animals have biological social instincts, do they also sense that they _ought_ to behave in social ways? For all we can tell, they are merely acting on compulsion with no real moral sense or moral reflection. The behavioral facts are there, but the value component seems to be lacking. Consider further how we as human spectators view animal social behaviors such as sharing, cooperation, and empathy. We recognize the fact that these social behaviors are helpful to the group’s survival, but we are not in a position to claim that a dog or chimp has a moral obligation to share its food, cooperate with others, or rescue a companion. In fact, it sounds odd to even say that animals have such moral obligations.

             Turning to human evolution and morality, there is another gap between empirical facts and moral values that we have seen with Huxley’s problem. Natural selection has implanted in us competing tendencies to be sociable in some situations and unsociable in others, but natural selection does not tell us that we ought to follow the sociable ones and subdue the unsociable. Darwin, as we’ve seen, sidesteps this problem by arguing that natural selection has strengthened social instincts above our unsocial ones. But this only explains why human social behavior is as prevalent as it is: it does not tell us why our dominating social instincts counts as “moral” as opposed to merely “socially effective” or just another brute sociological fact of human behavior such as making tools or speaking languages.

             Morality, then, is a unique thing that goes beyond mere scientific facts. Philosophers understand this, and for centuries have developed theories to explain what ethical judgments are and what their foundation is. It is understandable why scientists would be frustrated by a subject that is rooted in value rather than fact, but the very nonfactual nature of ethics will securely keep it within the domain of philosophy.

Science Only with No Input from Philosophy

The opposite extreme view regarding the relation between biological science and ethics is that it should be a subject for biologists, not philosophers. Biologist Edward O. Wilson famously challenged philosophy’s monopoly of ethics stating that “Scientists and humanists should consider together the possibility that the time has come for ethics to be removed temporarily from the hands of the philosophers and biologicized.”17 Moral judgments, he says, have their foundation in genetics, which in turn was shaped through biological evolution. De Waal argues similarly that “we seem to be reaching a point at which science can wrest morality from the hands of the philosophers… . The occasional disagreements within this budding field are far outweighed by the shared belief that evolution needs to be part of any satisfactory explanation of morality.”18

             The long-standing philosophical assumption about morality is that it is grounded in a transcendent or higher realm of universal truth. And, that higher realm can only be accessed through rational intuition, religious enlightenment, a moral sense, or some other cognitive vehicle that is immune to scientific inquiry. In many ways this parallels traditional assumptions about religion: there is a higher religious reality that we access only through a religious experience, which is also immune to scientific inquiry. The fact-value gap in traditional ethical theory results from this rift between the tangible limits of scientific inquiry (fact) and the higher moral realm (value). But what if that higher moral realm is only a fairy tale? What if the lofty philosophical claims about universal moral truths are merely the result of overzealous abstract thinking? The fact-value problem would then fall flat, and along with it the misguided 2,500-year history of philosophical ethics. From their work in animal and evolutionary ethics, biologists offer us the most plausible alternative explanation of where morality comes from. It is grounded in naturally selected genes that give rise to social instincts, and, in humans, a moral sense that is as sophisticated as human intelligence itself.

             A full account of everything scientists could say about morality would be a complicated one, but, with the combined efforts of biologists and social scientists, a fuller picture may emerge. Here are some of the scientific disciplines that would be involved in such a collaborative project, and the key questions that they would seek to answer.

• Geneticists: What are the genes that generate social behaviors?

• Neuroscientists: What is the precise the neural wiring within our brains that is responsible for social behaviors?

• Animal Scientists: What are the instinctive social behaviors of social animals?

• Evolutionary Biologists: What were the environmental constraints on early hominids that led to social instincts?

• Anthropologists: What social behaviors in contemporary indigenous tribes might resemble those of early humans?

• Developmental Psychologists: How do human social behaviors emerge in infancy and childhood?

• Abnormal psychologists: How does social behavior go wrong?

• Sociologists: What values do people hold in various cultures and subcultures?

• Political Scientists: What are the pros and cons of various morally relevant laws?

• Economists: How can we test people’s moral choices through hypothetical scenarios in game theory?

• Cognitive Scientists: What are the potential cognitive flaws in the moral decision-making process?

In this chapter, we have focused on the contributions of just two sciences on the above list, namely, those of animal scientists and evolutionary biologists. Two other sciences on this list, though, deserve brief mentioning. First, there are game theory experiments conducted by economists that show how people in social groups perceive cooperation, fairness, and altruism. One important study of altruism was conducted on natives in Papua New Guinea as a way of understanding tribal altruism during earlier human evolution. Player A receives $100 with the understanding that he could share any amount with Player B (who has no money). Player C, who receives $50, watches how much money A gives to B. If C is unhappy with the amount of A’s altruistic giving, then C can spend $10, $20, or $30 which will punish A by removing those same amounts of money from A. The normal expectation for A’s sharing was a 50/50 split, which, in hunter-gatherer tribes, ensures that if one group member comes back from a hunt with nothing, other hunters will give him an equal portion to make up the difference. The study showed that if B and C were from the same tribe, C would punish A more harshly for subnormal sharing than if B and C were from different tribes (in both cases, A was from a different tribe than B or C). That is, “punishers protect ingroup victims — who suffer from a norm violation — much more than they do outgroup victims, regardless of the norm violator’s group affiliation.”19 The point is that tribal people have a higher standard of fairness for those within their own group than they do for those within other groups.

             Second, there are studies in cognitive science that examine our moral decision-making process. One study suggests that we usually engage in moral reasoning after we have already reached a moral judgment, rather than beforehand as we commonly assume. Other studies suggest that moral judgments sometimes depend on factors that are morally irrelevant, such as how a set of moral choices is worded, or whether a moral dilemma involves me or someone else. People are also harsher in their moral judgments when they are hungry, rather than just after a meal. Many studies of morality in cognitive science, such as these, expose irregularities and even defects with how we make moral judgments, which implies that our moral intuitions are not as reliable as we might think.

             Returning to the above list of disciplines, the goal of this collaborative project would be that, for any question about morality we might ask, there would be some area of science that could offer a tangible and satisfactory answer. Where does morality come from? What values should I hold? Why do I sometimes make immoral choices? The larger benefit of this project would be to remove ethics from philosophical fairyland, similar to what happened centuries ago when transferring the study of the stars from astrology to astronomy, the study of chemicals from alchemy to chemistry, and the study of insanity from demonology to biology.

Both Philosophy and Science

So far we’ve seen the two extreme views about who is best qualified to understand the nature of morality: philosophers only, or scientists only. Much of the dispute rests on the fact-value problem, which we will examine in greater detail in a later chapter. But, for the sake of argument, let’s assume that the fact-value problem is a fairytale, as Wilson and some other scientists have charged. Let’s assume that if we knew all the facts connected with morality, that would essentially exhaust the subject and there would be no mysterious value left to explore. Does that mean that philosophy should step aside and let science take over? Not necessarily. First, the “science-only” position sketched above is more like a wish list of what scientists hope to accomplish in the study of ethics. If we go through the above list of scientific disciplines and evaluate their actual contributions to date regarding morality, we will see that they are only at a preliminary stage. For example, geneticists have not identified all morally relevant genes. Neuroscientists have no complete map of the brain’s neural connections, much less an understanding of which connections are related to morality. Evolutionary biologists engage in a lot of speculation about primitive human social behavior, which often looks more like philosophy than science. While the reality of human evolution is indisputable, picky details about it have unfortunately been lost to time.

             We will find similar limitations within each of the above disciplines, and, until science has a more complete analysis of morality, philosophy is entitled to continue its study of the subject. But as new studies in the science of morality become available, philosophers would be wise to take that scientific information into account, and not just conduct business as usual. A middle position, then would be a philosophical study of morality that was continually informed by new science. An important benefit of this approach is that we could formulate our moral expectations more clearly and realistically. For example, as the study in Papua New Guinea suggests, our natural expectations of fair treatment are higher when the victim is a member of our ingroup, rather than a complete stranger. Perhaps this means that we must try harder to universalize our notions of fairness so that we can overcome this under-evolved natural inclination. This may be similar to how we try to overcome our natural inclination for fatty foods, which served us well in early days of human evolution when food was scarce and life was short, but now is an inclination that harms our health and longevity. For each new scientific study in morality, there may be similar attention-getting messages that philosophers should be alert to.

             One moral philosopher who took seriously the message of evolution was John Dewey, and in many ways he serves as a model for mediating between the interests of science and philosophy. According to Dewey, we need to understand morality as an outgrowth of evolution insofar is it results from humans adapting to their environments. In early days of human evolution, our ancestors biologically adapted to environmental pressures, completely unaware that natural selection was taking place. Moral evolution is still ongoing today, but now we are conscious of it. Dewey argues that our present social environment is changing at a blindingly fast pace, which makes modern life very unstable, perhaps even more so than life in early days of evolution. We thus need to consciously adapt our moral conceptions and behavior to these new conditions; other outdated moral conceptions will simply die out since they can no longer compete. But, he warns, we can neither simply abandon our old moral traditions and institutions, which will lead to chaos, nor maintain them without change, which will lead to their extinction. Instead, we must update them by experimenting with different social ideas and seeing which ones will work within our present environment. Such changes to our traditional morality will require “re-constitution and re-adaptation, and that modification will be accompanied by pain. Growth always costs something. It costs the making over of the old in order to meet the demands of the new.”20 All of this social adaptation is still evolution through natural selection, but it is a very conscious and intentional one at a social level, rather than an unconscious one at a biological level.

             Dewey’s point is that we cannot simply throw out traditional philosophical theories of morality, even misguided ones. The parts that still function within today’s society, we keep. The parts that are ill-adapted, we modify. Dewey warns that moral values and institutions that fail to adapt to the challenges of ever-changing social environments will ultimately die out. This same warning may apply to moral philosophy itself. By stubbornly holding to antiquated metaphysical theories about transcendent realms of moral truth, philosophy risks becoming irrelevant. For Dewey, science is responsible for the rapid changes in our environment: “The growth of science, its application in invention to industrial life, the multiplication and acceleration of means of transportation and intercommunication, have created a peculiarly unstable environment.” Now, over a century after Dewey wrote this, technological change has only become more rapid. Science, then, is the unstable environment that will either force moral philosophy to adapt or die out.

**READING 1: DARWIN ON THE ORIGIN OF ETHICS FROM EVOLUTION**

**The Evolutionary Development of Animal Social Instincts**

It has, I think, now been shown that man and the higher animals, especially the Primates, have some few instincts in common. All have the same senses, intuitions, and sensations—similar passions, affections, and emotions, even the more complex ones, such as jealousy, suspicion, emulation, gratitude, and magnanimity; they practice deceit and are revengeful; they are sometimes susceptible to ridicule, and even have a sense of humor; they feel wonder and curiosity; they possess the same faculties of imitation, attention, deliberation, choice, memory, imagination, the association of ideas, and reason, though in very different degrees. The individuals of the same species graduate in intellect from absolute imbecility to high excellence. They are also liable to insanity, though far less often than in the case of man. . . .

             The following proposition seems to me in a high degree probable—namely, that any animal whatever, endowed with well-marked social instincts (the parental and filial affections being here included) would inevitably acquire a moral sense or conscience, as soon as its intellectual powers had become as well, or nearly as well developed, as in man. For, firstly, the social instincts lead an animal to take pleasure in the society of its fellows, to feel a certain amount of sympathy with them, and to perform various services for them. . . .

             It may be well first to premise that I do not wish to maintain that any strictly social animal, if its intellectual faculties were to become as active and as highly developed as in man, would acquire exactly the same moral sense as ours. . . . A moral being is one who is capable of comparing his past and future actions or motives, and of approving or disapproving of them. We have no reason to suppose that any of the lower animals have this capacity. Therefore, when a Newfoundland dog drags a child out of the water, or a monkey faces danger to rescue its comrade, or takes charge of an orphan monkey, we do not call its conduct moral. But in the case of man, who alone can with certainty be ranked as a moral being, actions of a certain class are called moral, whether performed deliberately, after a struggle with opposing motives, or impulsively through instinct, or from the effects of slowly-gained habit. . . .

**Similarities between Human and Animal Mental Capacities**

There can be no doubt that the difference between the mind of the lowest man and that of the highest animal is immense. . . . Nevertheless the difference in mind between man and the higher animals, great as it is, certainly is one of degree and not of kind. We have seen that the senses and intuitions, the various emotions and faculties, such as love, memory, attention, curiosity, imitation, reason, etc., of which man boasts, may be found in an incipient, or even sometimes in a well-developed condition, in the lower animals. They are also capable of some inherited improvement, as we see in the domestic dog compared with the wolf or jackal. If it could be proved that certain high mental powers, such as the formation of general concepts, self-consciousness, etc., were absolutely peculiar to man, which seems extremely doubtful, it is not improbable that these qualities are merely the incidental results of other highly-advanced intellectual faculties; and these again mainly the result of the continued use of a perfect language. At what age does the new-born infant possess the power of abstraction, or become self-conscious, and reflect on its own existence? We cannot answer; nor can we answer in regard to the ascending organic scale. The half-art, half-instinct of language still bears the stamp of its gradual evolution. The ennobling belief in God is not universal with man; and the belief in spiritual agencies naturally follows from other mental powers. The moral sense perhaps affords the best and highest distinction between man and the lower animals . . . .

**Human Moral Qualities give a Survival Advantage to Tribes but not to Individuals**

Turning now to the social and moral faculties. In order that primeval men, or the ape-like progenitors of man, should become social, they must have acquired the same instinctive feelings, which impel other animals to live in a body; and they no doubt exhibited the same general disposition. They would have felt uneasy when separated from their comrades, for whom they would have felt some degree of love; they would have warned each other of danger, and have given mutual aid in attack or defense. All this implies some degree of sympathy, fidelity, and courage. Such social qualities, the paramount importance of which to the lower animals is disputed by no one, were no doubt acquired by the progenitors of man in a similar manner, namely, through natural selection, aided by inherited habit. When two tribes of primeval man, living in the same country, came into competition, if (other circumstances being equal) the one tribe included a great number of courageous, sympathetic and faithful members, who were always ready to warn each other of danger, to aid and defend each other, this tribe would succeed better and conquer the other. Let it be borne in mind how all- important in the never-ceasing wars of savages, fidelity and courage must be. The advantage which disciplined soldiers have over undisciplined hordes follows chiefly from the confidence which each man feels in his comrades. Obedience, as Mr. Bagehot has well shown, is of the highest value, for any form of government is better than none. Selfish and contentious people will not cohere, and without coherence nothing can be effected. A tribe rich in the above qualities would spread and be victorious over other tribes: but in the course of time it would, judging from all past history, be in its turn overcome by some other tribe still more highly endowed. Thus the social and moral qualities would tend slowly to advance and be diffused throughout the world.

             But it may be asked, how within the limits of the same tribe did a large number of members first become endowed with these social and moral qualities, and how was the standard of excellence raised? It is extremely doubtful whether the offspring of the more sympathetic and benevolent parents, or of those who were the most faithful to their comrades, would be reared in greater numbers than the children of selfish and treacherous parents belonging to the same tribe. He who was ready to sacrifice his life, as many a savage has been, rather than betray his comrades, would often leave no offspring to inherit his noble nature. The bravest men, who were always willing to come to the front in war, and who freely risked their lives for others, would on an average perish in larger numbers than other men. Therefore, it hardly seems probable, that the number of men gifted with such virtues, or that the standard of their excellence, could be increased through natural selection, that is, by the survival of the fittest; for we are not here speaking of one tribe being victorious over another. . . .

             It must not be forgotten that although a high standard of morality gives but a slight or no advantage to each individual man and his children over the other men of the same tribe, yet that an increase in the number of well-endowed men and an advancement in the standard of morality will certainly give an immense advantage to one tribe over another. A tribe including many members who, from possessing in a high degree the spirit of patriotism, fidelity, obedience, courage, and sympathy, were always ready to aid one another, and to sacrifice themselves for the common good, would be victorious over most other tribes; and this would be natural selection. At all times throughout the world tribes have supplanted other tribes; and as morality is one important element in their success, the standard of morality and the number of well-endowed men will thus everywhere tend to rise and increase.

**READING 2: HUXLEY ON ETHICS DISTINCT FROM EVOLUTION**

**Cosmic Evolution does not Prefer Moral sentiments over Immoral Sentiments**

The propounders of what are called the "ethics of evolution" (when the "evolution of ethics" would usually better express the object of their speculations), adduce a number of more or less interesting facts and more or less sound arguments in favor of the origin of the moral sentiments, in the same way as other natural phenomena, by a process of evolution. I have little doubt, for my own part, that they are on the right track; but as the immoral sentiments have no less been evolved, there is, so far, as much natural sanction for the one as the other. The thief and the murderer follow nature just as much as the philanthropist. Cosmic evolution may teach us how the good and the evil tendencies of man may have come about; but, in itself, it is incompetent to furnish any better reason why what we call good is preferable to what we call evil than we had before. Some day, I doubt not, we shall arrive at an understanding of the evolution of the Aesthetic faculty; but all the understanding in the world will neither increase nor diminish the force of the intuition that this is beautiful and that is ugly.

             There is another fallacy which appears to me to pervade the so-called "ethics of evolution." It is the notion that because, on the whole, animals and plants have advanced in perfection of organization by means of the struggle for existence and the consequent "survival of the fittest;" therefore men in society, men as ethical beings, must look to the same process to help them towards perfection. I suspect that this fallacy has arisen out of the unfortunate ambiguity of the phrase "survival of the fittest." "Fittest" has a connotation of "best;" and about "best" there hangs a moral flavor. In cosmic nature, however, what is "fittest" depends upon the conditions. Long since, I ventured to point out that if our hemisphere were to cool again, the survival of the fittest might bring about, in the vegetable kingdom, a population of more and more stunted and humbler and humbler organisms, until the "fittest" that survived might be nothing but lichens, diatoms, and such microscopic organisms as those which give red snow its color; while, if it became hotter, the pleasant valleys of the Thames and Isis might, be uninhabitable by any animated beings save those that flourish in a tropical jungle. They, as the fittest, the best adapted to the changed conditions, would survive.

**Social Progress requires Combatting the Cosmic Evolutionary Process**

Men in society are undoubtedly subject to the cosmic process. As among other animals, [reproductive] multiplication goes on without cessation, and involves severe competition for the means of support. The struggle for existence tends to eliminate those less fitted to adapt themselves to the circumstances of their existence. The strongest, the most self-assertive, tend to tread down the weaker. But the influence of the cosmic process on the evolution of society is the greater the more rudimentary its civilization. Social progress means a checking of the cosmic, process at every step and the substitution for it of another, which may be called the ethical process; the end of which is not the survival of those who may happen to be the fittest, in respect of the whole of the conditions which obtain, but of those who are ethically the best.

             As I have already urged, the practice of that which is ethically best—what we call goodness or virtue—involves a course of conduct which, in all respects, is opposed to that which leads to success in the cosmic struggle for existence. In place of ruthless self-assertion it demands self-restraint; in place of thrusting aside, or treading down, all competitors, it requires that the individual shall not merely respect, but shall help his fellows. Its influence is directed, not so much to the survival of the fittest, as to the fitting of as many as possible to survive. It repudiates the gladiatorial theory of existence. It demands that each man who enters into the enjoyment of the advantages of a polity shall be mindful of his debt to those who have laboriously constructed it; and shall take heed that no act of his weakens the fabric in which he has been permitted to live. Laws and moral precepts are directed to the end of curbing the cosmic process and reminding the individual of his duty to the community, to the protection and influence of which he owes, if not existence itself, at least the life of something better than a brutal savage. . . .

             Let us understand, once for all, that the ethical progress of society depends, not on imitating the cosmic process, still less in running away from it, but in combating it. It may seem an audacious proposal thus to pit the microcosm against the macrocosm and to set man to subdue nature to his higher ends. But I venture to think that the great intellectual difference between the ancient times with which we have been occupied and our day, lies in the solid foundation we have acquired for the hope that such an enterprise may meet with a certain measure of success.

**Human Civilization requires Continually Modifying the Cosmic Process**

The history of civilization details the steps by which men have succeeded in building up an artificial world within the cosmos. Fragile reed as he may be, man, as Pascal says, is a thinking reed: there lies within him a fund of energy operating intelligently and so far akin to that which pervades the universe, that it is competent to influence and modify the cosmic process. In virtue of his intelligence, the dwarf bends the Titan to his will. In every family, in every polity that has been established, the cosmic process in man has been restrained and otherwise modified by law and custom. In surrounding nature, it has been similarly influenced by the art of the shepherd, the agriculturist, the artisan. As civilization has advanced, so has the extent of this interference increased; until the organized and highly developed sciences and arts of the present day have endowed man with a command over the course of non-human nature greater than that once attributed to the magicians. The most impressive, I might say startling, of these changes have been brought about in the course of the last two centuries; while a right comprehension of the process of life and of the means of influencing its manifestations is only just dawning upon us. We do not yet see our way beyond generalities; and we are befogged by the obtrusion of false analogies and crude anticipations. But Astronomy, Physics, Chemistry, have all had to pass through similar phases, before they reached the stage at which their influence became an important factor in human affairs. Physiology, Psychology, Ethics, Political Science, must submit to the same ordeal. Yet it seems to me irrational to doubt that, at no distant period, they will work as great a revolution in the sphere of practice.

             The theory of evolution encourages no millennial [i.e. utopian] anticipations. If, for millions of years, our globe has taken the upward road [towards peace], yet, some time, the summit will be reached and the downward route [towards anarchy] will be commenced. The most daring imagination will hardly venture upon the suggestion that the power and the intelligence of man can ever arrest the procession of the great year [i.e., inevitable cosmic cycle].

             Moreover, the cosmic nature born with us and, to a large extent, necessary for our maintenance, is the outcome of millions of years of severe training, and it would be folly to imagine that a few centuries will suffice to subdue its masterfulness to purely ethical ends. Ethical nature may count upon having to reckon with a tenacious and powerful enemy as long as the world lasts. But, on the other hand, I see no limit to the extent to which intelligence and will, guided by sound principles of investigation, and organized in common effort, may modify the conditions of existence, for a period longer than that now covered by history. And much may be done to change the nature of man himself. The intelligence which has converted the brother of the wolf into the faithful guardian of the flock ought to be able to do something towards curbing the instincts of savagery in civilized men.

**INTRODUCTION**

Women in much of the world today take it for granted that they have the same fundamental rights as men, but as recently as the 1960s and 1970s in the United States this was not so. A woman could be refused a credit card if she was single, and if married she needed a co-signature from her husband. Women could not take birth control in some states, keep their jobs if pregnant, practice law, officially run in the Boston Marathon, or attend Harvard, Yale, or Princeton. If we go back to the early 1900s, women could not vote, easily attend any college or get any kind of professional job. Go back still further and women could not own property or file for divorce. Just as societies of the past have relegated women to a lower status, so too have many traditional moral theories that emerged during these same periods of time.

             Men have not only made the moral rules of society, but they have done so in such a way that the female perspective of moral issues has been ignored in favor of a male perspective. British philosopher Alison Jaggar describes five ways in which traditional ethical theory has a harmful male bias.1 First, there is a lack of concern for women’s interests to the extent that it relegates to women a series of subservient obligations, such as obedience, silence, and faithfulness. Second, it neglects women’s issues by confining them to a socially isolated domestic realm of society that does not rise to the level of legitimate political regulation. Third, it denies the moral agency of women in the sense that women are said to lack the capacity for moral reasoning. Fourth, there is a preference for masculine values over female ones, where the former include “independence, autonomy, intellect, will, wariness, hierarchy, domination, culture, transcendence, product, asceticism, war, and death.” Underappreciated feminine ones, by contrast, include “interdependence, community, connection, sharing, emotion, body, trust, absence of hierarchy, nature, immanence, process, joy, peace, and life.” And, fifth, there is a devaluation of women’s moral experience in favor of male notions of moral rules, judgments about particular actions, impartial moral assessments, and contractual agreements. All of these ignore the more female approaches, which look at the special contexts of moral situations and attempt to resolve them through empathetic feeling rather than through appealing to rules.

             In this chapter, we will look at some of the problems with traditional theories of gender and morality, and consider whether there is a more uniquely female approach to morality that better expresses the female perspective. This issue of gender and morality hinges on two fundamental questions:

1. How do men and women psychologically differ from each other (if at all)?

2. Based on those psychological differences, how do men and women morally differ from each other (if at all)?

             Both are perfectly legitimate questions, and in fact we ask similar ones all the time. Take children, for example. We’re keenly interested in understanding the psychological differences between children and adults, and we typically conclude that those differences impact children’s capacity for moral judgment and responsibility. Younger children, in particular, do not have the psychological tools to weigh long-term consequences of actions as effectively as adults do, which in turn skews their capacity for moral responsibility. Consider also how we judge the moral capacity of psychologically impaired adults with a brain injury or who have been brainwashed. We don’t expect the same level of moral responsibility from them, and often we don’t find them morally responsible at all for behavior that would otherwise land you or me in jail. We apply similar reasoning to our moral assessment of animals. While we like to treat our pet dogs and cats as family members, we recognize that, in spite of their intelligence, they psychologically differ from us to such a degree that we don’t recognize any capacity of moral responsibility within them whatsoever. Similar reasoning would guide us if we were visited by aliens from a distant planet. Perhaps the first question we’d ask is how psychologically similar are they to us, and the answer to that question would tell us whether we should welcome them into our community as moral equals, or instead run for our lives.

             The above two questions are natural enough for us to ask when considering gender differences. Men and women differ psychologically from each other at least somewhat, and it very well may be that those psychological differences shape men’s and women’s respective moral capacities. But as natural as it is for us to ask these two questions, how we’ve answered them throughout history has determined whether women have been empowered or subjugated.

**CLASSIC VIEWS**

Discussions of gender and morality began in ancient Greece almost as soon as philosophy emerged as a formal discipline; however, from the start, opinions about women’s moral capacities were biased. We will consider just a few of the classic views on this issue, beginning with Aristotle.

**Aristotle: Women and Natural Subservience**

When addressing the first question above, “how do men and women psychologically differ from each other,” Aristotle’s answer is that men are psychologically designed to command, and women to obey. It is nature’s way to have some born as leaders and others as followers and, by natural design, women are the followers. Their role as followers, he argues, is most evident in the family structure, where there are three hierarchical relations: the household master over the slave, the husband over the wife, and the father over the children. In each of these three cases, one sets the rules and dominates over the other. Aristotle is not saying that women are slaves or children, but rather that they fill a subordinate role within the family, parallel to the way that slaves and children do. What differentiates women from slaves and children is the psychological ability to make thoughtful and deliberative choices. Slaves lack that ability completely, and children have that ability only in an immature and undeveloped state. Women do have the ability to make deliberative choices, but lack a natural authority behind what they decide. It is only men who make deliberative choices with leadership and authority, and only when they are adults and not naturally servile slaves. This, according to Aristotle, is the way that nature designed us.

             In view of these natural psychological differences, Aristotle proceeds to the second question: how do men and women morally differ from each other—or in his words, “we may ask about the natural ruler, and the natural subject, whether they have the same or different virtues” (_Politics_, 1.13). His answer is mixed. All of us need to acquire the full range of virtues, including courage, temperance, generosity, and good temper. However, each of these virtues displays itself differently based on the constraints of our psychological makeup. Men’s virtues are tied to their natural capacity to command, and women’s to their natural capacity to obey. Yes, women should have the virtue of courage, but their courage should be in performing challenging tasks under the husband’s leadership. Yes, they should have the virtue of temperance and restraint, but in different areas than men. Being subservient, women should be less talkative than men. Yes, they should be virtuous in household management, but their expertise lies in frugality and maintaining what the husband acquires, not in acquiring it herself. Accordingly, we cannot expect virtues in men and women to display themselves in the same way: “A man would be thought a coward if he had no more courage than a courageous woman, and a woman would be thought overly talkative if she imposed no more restraint on her conversation than the good man” (ibid., 3.4). For Aristotle, then, there is a distinct type of female morality that is grounded in their uniquely female capacity. There are special female ways of developing the traditional virtues, and there are special female moral obligations that stem from women’s natural function. It is not a flattering type of morality since it draws from their presumed natural subservience, but it is one that is nonetheless uniquely female.

             What should we think about Aristotle’s conception of gender and ethics? Today, the notion of natural female subservience is flat out rejected, and to even hint at it will invite cries of bigotry. One reason is that we are now in a much better position to see women excel in leadership roles when society does not hold them back through gender discrimination. Aristotle devised his social philosophy based on how the societies of his time actually operated, all of which were patriarchal. All that he saw were societies of men taking control and women dutifully obeying. In that context, it would be easy for anyone to infer that women were by nature subservient to men, and perhaps it would have been nearly impossible for even the most enlightened thinker to conceive otherwise. What it took was a massive social alteration, where women were given equal access to education and job opportunities, revealing that they could successfully compete head on in leadership roles with men. There are still some societies today that cling to the patriarchal structures that Aristotle defends, but they are becoming fewer and increasingly unpopular.

**Rousseau: Women as Objects of Sexual Desire**

Aristotle’s view of gender and ethics was reiterated by moral philosophers for centuries that followed, partly because of the authoritative position that Aristotle held as one of the greatest philosophers, and partly because society continued its patriarchal structure that reinforced gender stereotypes. Two thousand years after Aristotle, we find the notion of natural female subservience in the views of French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778). Rousseau, we should note, was not any more sexist than other writers of his time, but he is among the most notorious since he wrote a treatise on the philosophy of education, which discusses in great detail the differences between men and women. Regarding the first question above concerning the psychological differences between the genders, men, Rousseau argues, are strong and aggressive and women are weak, passive, and offer little resistance. Nature has perfectly paired up these two opposing tendencies in the genders and thus made women especially for men’s delight. It is his strength that attracts her to him, and it is her allurement that attracts him to her.

             Regarding the second question, how do men and women morally differ, Rousseau argues these natural psychological differences directly shape the moral differences between genders: women should make the most of weakness and use sex to get what they want from their husbands. A wife should make herself physically appealing to him, and not provoke him to anger. When she wants something specific from him, she should compel him by being sexually alluring. He thus depends on her cooperation to satisfy his sexual desires, and she in turn is willing to submit to his superior strength when she gets what she wants from him. Rather than being ashamed of being weak, she’s actually proud of it: “her soft muscles offer no resistance, she professes that she cannot lift the lightest weight; she would be ashamed to be strong.”2 Throughout her life, her weakness and passivity direct how she interacts with everyone around her. She needs freedom from work when pregnant, an easy life when nursing, and a zeal for love that unites and preserves the family. She must strive to maintain a good reputation as a faithful wife so that she convinces her husband that his children really are his. In view of these key psychological and moral differences between the genders, Rousseau argues that women need to be educated differently to bring out these natural differences, so that they can more effectively entice men through their beauty and charm. It would in fact be counterproductive to educate women as men are, since the more they are like men, the less influence they’ll have over them, “then men will be masters indeed”.3

**Wollstonecraft: Gender-Neutral Morality**

Eighteenth-century British philosopher Mary Wollstonecraft (1759–1797) examined many discussions of the so-called gender differences, including Rousseau’s, and said enough was enough. For too long, women have been both psychologically and morally misrepresented, and she was going to set the record straight. Yes, women are by nature physically weaker than men, but men have exploited this weakness and have imposed on women the status of fleeting objects of sexual desire, and women have fallen right into the trap. As to the first question regarding psychological differences between genders, she argues that men and women are in fact fundamentally the same. If it does not appear that way, that’s because of the gender roles that have been imposed on them. While young girls are taught to play with dolls, dress up, and be talkative, they would not naturally choose these activities: a “doll will never excite [a girl’s] attention unless confinement allows her no alternative.”4 Nevertheless, these traits stick with them and they spend their adult lives engaging in trivial and childish activities, such as wearing fashionable clothes, painting, decorating, and even inventing nicknames for animals. Most important, women are not born to be sexual flirts, as Rousseau maintained, but are taught to be that way since they have no other option.

             Concerning the second question regarding the moral differences between genders, Wollstonecraft argues that women and men are fundamentally the same morally as they are psychologically. The moral status of all humans is governed by three capacities that distinguish us from animals, namely: reason, the exercise of virtue, and the passion for knowledge. Women have all of these in the same degree that men do, and society should give the same freedom to cultivate them as men have. In their daily routines, women may take on special moral obligations, such as raising children, but these will not be uniquely female duties: “Women, I allow, may have different duties to fulfill; but they are _human_ duties, and the principles that should regulate the discharge of them, I sturdily maintain, must be the same” (ibid., Chapter 3). That is, any man performing the same activity, such as raising children, would have precisely the same moral obligations. It is merely incidental that women take on certain social roles, and not essential to their moral obligation. In fact, while women are commonly thought to be naturally virtuous with child rearing, Wollstonecraft argues to the contrary that women are not necessarily good at it: “Woman … seldom exerts enlightened maternal affection; for she either neglects her children, or spoils them by improper indulgence” (ibid., Chapter 10). Most importantly, women also have no special moral obligation to be subservient and sexually alluring to their husbands, as Rousseau maintained. The marital relation should be instead founded on friendship and a respect for the woman’s rational abilities. Morally speaking, as women become more emancipated, they will emulate the virtues of a man. This does not mean that women should excel in the skills of “hunting, shooting, and gaming,” or even that they should excel in the virtues of courage and fortitude, all of which are connected with the physically stronger bodies that men possess. Rather, Wollstonecraft argues, women should have the freedom to develop the rational virtues of truthfulness, justice, and humanity, which were traditionally more associated with men.

**Instinct vs. Social Construction**

Wollstonecraft was decades ahead of her time in many ways. She challenged centuries-old stereotypes of natural female subordination and gender roles within marriage and society. She insisted on both educational and vocational equality for women, envisioning a time when women could work as physicians, entrepreneurs, and in other areas traditionally reserved for men. She also envisioned a future when women could participate in the political system and directly defend women’s interests. All of these notions, along with her overall emphasis on equality and justice for women, resonate exceptionally well in today’s social and political climate. It is in that spirit of equality and justice that she fashioned her gender-neutral conception of morality: men and women alike have exactly the same fundamental moral obligations and virtues. Whatever moral differences there may seem to be between the genders are only the result of misguided education. Is Wollstonecraft’s theory of gender-neutral morality the final word on the subject? Probably not. It’s not because her conception of social justice is flawed in any way; in fact, her views of equality and justice are very robust. The reason has more to do with the psychological assumptions that she was making. In answering our first question, “How do men and women psychologically differ from each other?” she made her best guess based largely on her own personal experience as a woman: the genders are essentially the same regarding psychological capacity. She did not conduct experiments using the scientific method or draw on neurological studies—tools that were not available to her at the time. Her evidence was only anecdotal.

             Unfortunately, even today our ability to scientifically investigate gender differences is only slightly better than it was in Wollstonecraft’s day, and many of our contemporary views are still driven by stereotype and speculation. One published study asserted that women talk nearly three times as much as men— 20,000 words per day versus 7,000 spoken by men. But a later study showed that they were essentially the same, at around 16,000 words.5 Other studies suggested that boys are better at math than girls, but this too was overturned by a later study. Similar problems occur with attempts to show that women are better at multitasking.6 Nevertheless, there is growing scientific evidence that many psychological gender differences are genuine. A recent study of rhesus monkeys suggests that there is a hormonal basis for the toys that boys and girls prefer: “Male monkeys, like human boys, showed an overwhelming preference for the wheeled toys, while female monkeys, like human girls, though interacting more with the plush [doll] toys did not show a significant preference for one toy type over the other.”7

             While the jury is still out on the particulars, it is safe to say that there are at least some psychological gender differences that are very much ingrained in men and women, respectively. But a critical question that we must ask is whether these psychological differences are instinctive or merely social constructions. The rhesus monkey study does suggest that toy preferences between genders are in some way instinctive, and not merely a social construction that is imposed on genders through education or cultural brainwashing. But maybe that study, like so many others on gender differences, will be overturned by a new one. Thus, even if it is supported by current science, we may need to ignore it for the time being. Galileo once argued that we should not stubbornly cling to theories when “the contrary may afterwards be revealed by the evidence of our senses, or by actual demonstration.”8 This advice could apply to many of our present convictions about gender differences, which may be overturned at any time by scientific studies. Further, the issue of gender differences is so sensitive that some scientific studies do not even make their way into the popular media for fear of bringing on a firestorm of critique.9 Wollstonecraft states that she resisted committing herself to the nature–nurture issue on psychological gender differences as much as she could. Playing it safe like this may only prolong an essential nature–nurture question that must ultimately be answered. Nevertheless, whether they are rooted in instincts or social constructions, some gender differences are so strong that they deserve to be acknowledged right now and taken seriously as possible foundations for gender differences in ethics.

**FEMALE CARE ETHICS**

Let’s grant that there are at least some major psychological differences between genders. The next critical issue involves determining which ones, if any, might shape ethical differences between men and women. A good example is the psychological difference between toys that boys prefer and toys that girls prefer. A preference toward wheeled toys implies that a child has an interest in how things work, such as the rules of mechanics, cause, and effect. This might well translate into a male disposition to see the social and moral world as a giant rule-governed machine. A preference toward dolls, by contrast, suggests an interest in personal relationships and emotional interactions between play characters. This then might translate into a female tendency to see the social and moral world as a network of personal relationships. That is, women excel in their capacity for nurturing and caring for others. In the home, women bear the brunt of child rearing and care for elderly relatives. In the workplace, women dominate in the fields of education, nursing, counseling, and social work. Does this special psychological capacity mean that women have a special moral capacity to care? Many contemporary moral philosophers have answered this with a resounding “yes”: morality from a female perspective focuses on caring for others. Whereas men are typically more rule-following with morality and emphasize abstract moral duties, women typically focus on particular relationships and the need for caring within those relationships.

**Kohlberg and Gilligan: Justice vs. Care**

In her groundbreaking book _In a Different Voice_ (1982),10 American social psychologist Carol Gilligan championed the idea of a uniquely female ethics of care. She developed her view in reaction to a famous theory of moral development by Harvard psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg. According to Kohlberg, from childhood on through adulthood, people progress in their moral thinking, moving through six different stages. We begin selfishly with a focus on personal gratification and the desire to avoid punishment. When we do consider the interests of other people, our concern is with how we might benefit, as in I’ll scratch your back if you scratch mine. But as we mature and move through different stages of moral development, we look beyond our individual wants and focus more on the ideals of justice and universally applied abstract principles of morality. Kohlberg supported his theory through a series of studies in which he presented people of varying ages with moral dilemmas, and then asked them to explain what the right choice should be. In one study, he asked eleven-year-old boys to resolve a dilemma in which a man named Heinz has a very sick wife and cannot afford the costly drug necessary to save her life. Heinz has an opportunity to steal the drug from a pharmacy. What should Heinz do? A typical male response is that given by a boy called “Jack”: Heinz should steal the drug. Jack reasons in this way:

[Jack:] For one thing, human life is worth more than money, and if the druggist only makes $1,000, he is still going to live, but if Heinz doesn’t steal the drug, his wife is going to die.

_Why is life worth more than money?_

[Jack:] Because the druggist can get a thousand dollars later from rich people with cancer, but Heinz can’t get his wife again.

_Why not?_

[Jack:] Because people are all different and so you couldn’t get Heinz’s wife again.

_What if Heinz does not love his wife?_

[Jack:] He should still steal the drugs to save his wife’s life, for there is “a difference between hating and killing.”

Jack places morality over the law, for “the laws have mistakes, and you can’t go writing up a law for everything that you can imagine.”11

             Gilligan objects that Kohlberg’s studies were done entirely on males, and she contrasts this kind of male-oriented rational moral thinking with that of the average eleven-year-old girl, whose moral reasons emphasize relationships. Typical of girls’ responses to the Heinz dilemma is that of the girl called “Amy,” who responds to the question of whether Heinz should steal the drugs:

I don’t think so. I think there might be other ways besides stealing it, like if he could borrow the money or make a loan or something, but he really shouldn’t steal the drug—but his wife shouldn’t die either.

Responding to the question, why shouldn’t Heinz steal the drug? Amy points out the harmful effect that stealing the drug could have on the couple’s relationship.

If he stole the drug, he might save his wife’s life, but if he did, he might have to go to jail, and his wife might get weaker again, and he couldn’t get more of the drug, and it might not be good. So, they should really just talk it out and find some other way to make the money.

             Gilligan argues that, on average, a woman’s moral point of view is different from a man’s. Whereas men typically emphasize rights and principles of justice (moral justice even triumphs the law in the Heinz dilemma), women typically focus on particular relationships, on care, in which principles are less important, and they place more importance on the process (“they should talk it out and find some other way to make the money”). Gilligan agreed with Kohlberg that people move through different stages of moral development, but with women there are three specific levels. The first level is where a girl focuses too much on her personal interests, neglecting the needs of others. The second flips the situation, and she focuses too much on the needs of others, neglecting her own. The third is where her needs and those of others are more in balance.

             A defender of traditional morality might look at Gilligan’s three levels and conclude that there is nothing uniquely female about them; in fact, what the girl has done is developed her moral reasoning to the point of being a good utilitarian. She starts out as an egoist, focusing only on the consequences of her actions as only she was affected. She then becomes an altruist, considering the consequences of her actions as only others were affected. Finally, she considers the consequences of her actions as both she and others would be affected. But while Gilligan’s three stages may appear to move toward something like a utilitarian ideal, the unit of value for Gilligan remains that of care, rather than a traditional utilitarian value like pleasure, benefit, or preference. The ideal, for Gilligan, is for the woman to bring in balance how much of herself she commits to caring for others and for herself, without being either selfishly uncaring toward others, or a slave to the care of others.

**Care and Particularism**

Gilligan is one of many contemporary theorists who see care as the central component of female ethics. Their specific theories often differ, sometimes dramatically, but there are four common themes surrounding an ethics of care.12 First is that women see their personal identities as deeply interconnected with other people. Our identities are first formed within a social network of others, and even as adults when we think of who we are as people, our social network of family, friends, and community is right there at the core. By contrast, the traditional male approach is one that stresses personal autonomy, freedom, independence, and zones of privacy. Second is that women focus on specific circumstances surrounding moral situations. The male approach tends to see moral situations in the abstract, where the actions of individual people are just instances that should be judged by a general moral rule. Third is that women see morality within the context of close personal relationships and the development of intimate emotional connections. The traditional approach, by contrast, idealizes the impartial judge who makes moral assessments based on a rational decision-making process. Fourth is that women see morality as a function of vulnerability and dependency. The traditional approach depicts moral decision-makers as rational, courageous, and fully informed humans, which is far from the reality of helplessness in which we often find ourselves.

             With each of these four factors, the difference between the traditional and female approaches to morality may be only a matter of degree. Men also see themselves as interdependent, consider special circumstances in moral situations, develop emotional connections in personal relations, and recognize moral issues surrounding vulnerability. But these are not at the center of traditional conceptions of morality in the way that they are for women. For care ethics, then, it is precisely these particular relations, not the abstract universal principles that generate our ethics. This is called _moral particularism_; it states that morality always involves particular relations with particular people, not lifeless abstractions. Care ethicists reject traditional universalist ethics, the idea that ethics consists in universal moral principles, applicable to all people at all times. Instead, they argue that universalism is too abstract to justify our special obligations to family and community. Morality flourishes in concrete relationships that give meaning and purpose to our lives; we misconstrue the subject when we transform it into the abstract, bloodless universal principles of the core morality.

             Again, the difference between traditional and female approaches to morality may be only a matter of degree regarding their emphasis on particularism. Traditional moral theories already acknowledge special obligations to family, friends, and community. Kant would argue that we have special relations to our families because we are more deeply responsible for them. Utilitarians would argue that we will maximize utility if we each concentrate on helping those close to us, our family, friends, and local community members, rather than trying to give equal attention to people hundreds of miles away or in other countries. This is because we understand our close relations better than we do strangers and foreigners and are more likely to maximize welfare if we concentrate on their needs. Of course, for traditional moral theorists, we have obligations to people in other countries, but they seldom override our primary obligations to our family, friends, or local community. So, traditional moral theory can incorporate at least some of the particularist concerns of care ethics, while at the same time embracing general duties to those who fall outside of our personal sphere.

             But defenders of care ethics may question whether this component of “special obligation” within traditional morality is particularist enough. With such a heavy emphasis on abstract moral principles, these special obligations could be trivialized. Will traditional morality require us to carry out those special obligations with the same level of emotional connection and sensitivity to context that care ethics emphasizes? And, more importantly, would those special obligations within traditional ethics incline us to apply abstract notions of justice in a more particularized manner? If not, then traditional morality has not gone far enough in particularizing our moral obligations.

**Care and Virtues**

As we’ve seen, a dominant feature of care ethics is its mistrust of general moral principles that supposedly govern every morally relevant action. Because of the abstract nature of such general principles, they prevent us from grasping the unique context of each moral situation and thereby impose a cold and clinical moral judgment rather than prompting a more caring and contextual personal involvement in that situation. For this reason, many defenders of care ethics argue that care should be seen as a component of virtue theory, where care is a nurturing character trait that we personally internalize, as we do other virtues.

             This view was defended by American philosopher of education Nel Noddings.13 Care ethics, she argues, is a quest for new virtues based on traditional women’s practices, even when these female practices themselves become abandoned within modern society. Aristotle’s view of female virtues was based on a hierarchical social structure in which the lower classes were locked into their roles. As such, for Aristotle, women’s virtues were those of subservience, obedience, industry, silence, and service. But even these reflect women’s roles as nurturers, which, once the range of social and political privilege has been extended to women, can be developed into a nonsubservient ethics of caring. We should look in particular at everyday practices and traditional caring roles of women, such as cooking, teaching, nursing, and childhood education. Even though many of these tasks can be exploitive, they nevertheless require special virtues or character traits that traditional morality has overlooked. These all emphasize needs over rights, and love over duty. For Noddings, gender-free morality may simply be impossible. Men invented the criteria of what constitutes an adequate moral theory, emphasizing rights and duties, and so any female input on the traditional dialogue would be at an immediate disadvantage. It could not be left to men themselves to incorporate a female element into ethical theory, and the entire discussion of care would not have arisen if women did not initiate it. It is, then, virtue theory and its focus on character development that is most amenable to care ethics, rather than moral systems of rights and duties.

             But is Noddings correct that traditional rule-governed morality is a hostile environment to an ethics of care? American philosopher Sarah Clarke Miller disagrees, and argues instead that care is fully compatible with general moral principles. The resistance that care ethics has to principles stems from a mistaken view of the role that general principles of moral duties and rights actually play within moral theory. Indeed, the use of general principles may be receptive to the special contexts of moral situations that care ethics emphasizes. General principles serve as an overall guide for moral decision-making, but this is only one element of a larger process of moral judgment. We also need to “evaluate the role principles might play in any given moral situation by taking note of the relevant details of that situation, which is to say, by paying close attention to the context surrounding the moral situation and the particular features of the individuals involved.”14 We don’t force-fit all moral situations with their subtle differences into a few inflexible rules. The devil is in the details, and those details of a situation tell us whether the general rule applies, or perhaps requires a more particular rule of guidance. Thus, the female care value can be right at home when expressed as a duty and obligation to care. In fact, this may be a better fit than linking care to virtue theory. The world at present is horribly needy with massive poverty, starvation, the lack of clean water, and proper medical care. Current caregivers, as hard as they work, cannot come close to meeting the demand. The need is so great that it creates a moral urgency that is best expressed as a general duty to care.

             So, is the care value best expressed as a virtue, as Nodding recommends, or as a duty, as Miller recommends? The choice may be an artificial one since there are ways of marrying the two notions. In fact, the war between virtue theory and duty theory is a comparatively new one, and the concept of virtue was commonly seen as “the disposition to do right actions or duties,”15 that is, the practice of actualizing our duties. Morality begins with fundamental duties of obligation that are expressed as general rules. We then internalize those rules by forming virtuous habits which enable us to spontaneously act in obedience of our duties. In this way, we can begin with a duty to care that is generated by needs that we see throughout the world. We then develop the virtue to care, which enables us to act spontaneously and habitually in a caring way and, in essence, become caring people. What is important for advancing the female care value—at least at this stage in the development of the concept—is that it gains some foothold within the traditional ethical theory. If it can be expressed both as a virtue and a duty, then so much the better.

**FOUR OPTIONS REGARDING GENDER AND ETHICS**

We now have before us a sophisticated theory of ethics from the female perspective, and the next question we must answer is what this all means for traditional morality. Are women supposed to completely cut ties with traditional morality? And what about men: are they supposed to stick with the traditional rule-oriented approach or adapt to the female one? There are four possible options, each of which we will examine.

**Male-Only Option**

The first option is that only the traditional so-called “male” view of ethics is valid, which emphasizes general abstract principles, and both men and women should adopt it. The idea of a uniquely female morality is not a new one. It was jump started by Aristotle, and only in recent times has it been refashioned in a way that avoids demeaning stereotypes of female subservience and inferiority. But why refashion theories of female morality at all? Why not just dispense with them as remnants from an earlier time when moral philosophers were completely misguided about the psychological differences between men and women? While it is tempting to think that we understand gender differences much better now, even today scientific studies are casting doubt on many commonly held gender distinctions. It makes no sense to use gender difference to reform ethical theory when we are still not clear about what those differences are. On the other hand, the general principles of ethics devised by philosophers over the centuries have withstood the test of time. While some defenders of female morality try to brand this tradition as male-oriented, those principles of morality were formulated to apply universally to all people, male and female. Further, throughout history, traditional ethics has always included values that are very similar to the care value, such as charity, benevolence, civility, hospitality, and responsibility toward one’s children and parents. Wollstonecraft was right: morality is gender-neutral, and it is just a matter of giving women access to the traditional value system that is already in place.

             In response, yes it is true that in their best moments traditional ethicists have formulated moral principles that apply universally to men and women alike. But it is also true that traditional morality has always been tied to human physiology. There are emotions, drives, and natural inclinations that spark specific behaviors. There are special feelings like compassion and sympathy that inform our moral judgments. Even a rule-oriented value like justice is commonly tied to a special feeling—a _sense_ of justice. Recent biological research now tells us that physiological gender differences are critical to anything that is health-related: “Sex matters. Sex, that is, being male or female, is an important basic human variable that should be considered when designing and analyzing studies in all areas and at all levels of biomedical and health-related research.”16 To accept this in areas of health, but not in ethics, seems like holding to an outdated moral theory for the sake of nothing but tradition itself. While there are care-like values within traditional ethics, such as charity, they are often undervalued and they downplay particularization, which, by contrast, female care ethics emphasizes. We still may be fuzzy on the details of psychological gender differences, but advances in the fields of both biology and psychology suggest that advocates of female-oriented ethics are on the right track. Thus, the traditional “male-only” approach to ethics seems incomplete.

**Female-Only Option**

The second option is that only the female approach to morality is valid, and both men and women should adopt it. According to this view, men have hijacked the discipline of moral philosophy and forced it into an artificial system that worships rules and abstract principles, and ignores the heart and particular context of morality. Throughout time men are the ones who have dominated the field of philosophy, devising moral theories based on their own male psychological predispositions. Women had virtually no say in the matter, but, now that women can participate in the dialogue, it is time to point out the errors of the male-oriented approach and shift morality’s focus to the sorts of nurturing human experiences that women exemplify best. Wollstonecraft was right that there is only one conception of morality for all people to follow, but that conception is care ethics, not rigid rule-based systems. Maybe there are some disciplines, like the field of engineering, which are rightly male-oriented, but morality is not one of those disciplines. Ethics is female in character, and men and women alike should adopt it in its female form. Just as women have the capacity to work in male-oriented fields like engineering, men too have the capacity to assimilate a female approach to ethics. And, when it gains universal acceptance, there may no longer be a need to refer to it as a “female” morality—any more than we refer to education, social work, or counseling as “female” disciplines.

             The main problem with this female-only approach is that its conception of ethics is just as incomplete as the male-only approach. If it is wrong for traditional male ethical approaches to veto the female voice, then it is equally wrong for female ethical approaches to veto the male voice. Even if we grant that traditional ethics has not been as receptive to the women’s perspective as it should have been, it is quite another thing to maintain that there is absolutely nothing valid about the traditional conceptions of morality that have been forged over the past 2,500 years. Out the window go general principles of justice, duties, rights, consequences, contracts, impartiality, fairness, freedom, and responsibility. These are general principles that are not merely central to ethical theory, but also to our commonsense dialogues about the morally right thing to do. Traditional moral philosophers never pretended to have invented these ethical concepts in an isolated laboratory; they were instead refinements of the moral reasoning process that normal people engage in. An important part of the human thought process is to make abstractions and general rules about our life experiences. It is the foundation of all sciences, and it’s at the heart of our efforts to make sense of the world around us. Would it even be possible for someone to adopt a female-only approach to morality, never once drawing on the traditional repertoire of abstract moral concepts? Probably not. Thus, we should reject the female-only approach to ethics, just as we should the male-only approach. This leaves us with a conception of ethics that somehow involves both male and female elements, which we turn to next.

**Separate-but-Equal Option**

The third option is that there are two equally valid domains of ethics grounded in gender differences, where men should emphasize the male approach, and women the female approach. There is some psychological basis for this option. American social psychologist Roy F. Baumeister describes a study that monitored girls and boys for an hour at a playground. It turned out that girls played one-on-one with the same playmate for the full hour, whereas boys either played one-on-one with a series of different playmates or they played within a larger group. The girls seemed to prefer one-to-one relationships, while the boys preferred larger groups or networks. Thus, while men and women are both social, they appear to be so in different manners, where women specialize in the narrow sphere of intimate relationships, and men in the larger group. He writes, “If you make a list of activities that are done in large groups, you are likely to have a list of things that men do and enjoy more than women: team sports, politics, large corporations, economic networks, and so forth.”17 Baumeister speculates about the evolutionary advantages of this division of labor. Close relationships are more important since they are critical to our immediate survival, but the larger networks of shallower relationships are good for developing larger social systems from which culture develops. Thus, our species as a whole has benefited by engraining these two tendencies within the respective genders. Extending Baumeister’s analysis, we can see how the traditional male approach to morality, with its emphasis on general rules, is suited for bringing order to larger social groups of impersonal relationships. The female care value, by contrast, is suited for the more intimate relationships that we cultivate with others. Since these two approaches to morality are tied directly to psychological gender differences—how men and women are by nature sociable—it makes sense for men to emphasize the traditional ethical approach and women the care approach. Their ethical approaches are separate, but equal.

             However, this separate-but-equal option quickly falls apart. Right off, the psychological studies show only that men are more _motivated_ toward group interaction and women more _motivated_ toward intimate relationships. Both genders clearly have the capacity for both types of social interaction, and, as Baumeister himself says, it’s more a matter of what interests men and women, respectively. Men have the ability to raise the kids even if they’d prefer to run a business, and vice versa with women. And, from a moral perspective, just because a man may be interested in group activities more than intimate relationships, this does not mean he has no moral obligation to care for others in close relationships. Similarly, just because a woman may be more interested in intimate relationships than in group activities, this doesn’t mean that she should ignore all the general rules of traditional morality. Further, if the separate-but-equal option were instituted, it could have disastrous consequences for women. Take domestic chores like rearing children and seeing to the needs of elderly parents. Men could assign those tasks to women on the grounds that that is their area of moral expertise, while keeping for themselves the tasks of running governments and large corporations. This not only risks reinforcing traditional gender roles, but it adds a moral stigma to those who do not comply. It is not simply a breach of etiquette if a woman fails to care for her elderly parents or strives to run a business, but it is morally wrong for her to do so. Far from empowering women, this form of female morality is a throwback to ancient times and subjugates them as much as does Aristotle’s notion of female subservience. We must reject, then, the separate-but-equal option regarding gender and morality.

**Mutually Inclusive Option**

The final option is that men and women should adopt both the male and female approaches to morality. In our examination of the above three options, we’ve seen that there are just grounds for both, including the female perspective in ethics and for retaining the traditional male approach that stresses general rules. We’ve also seen that we cannot segregate these two approaches, assigning the one to women and the other to men. Rather, a mutually inclusive approach is needed where men and women internalize both tendencies. Women have indeed already internalized the traditional male approach to morality that emphasizes general rules. Even if women are naturally less interested in it than men, they’ve had thousands of years of practice at it. The burden, then, is placed on men to learn from the more uniquely female component of morality and internalize that. We’ve seen that men have that capacity and, if anything, it is just a question of motivating them to accept moral responsibility for tasks that might not necessarily interest them. Many of our typical moral obligations are already uncomfortable to us, particularly when they conflict with our selfish inclinations, such as treating people respectfully even when we don’t like them, or respecting other people’s property rights when they have something that we want, or telling the truth even when it’s to our disadvantage. But, the morally responsible person fulfills these obligations anyway. At worst, adjusting men’s moral expectations to include female values may mean expanding men’s set of moral obligations to include things that do not naturally interest them. But even then, there is the benefit of moral growth and the opportunity to make men more versatile moral agents than they would otherwise be.

**CONCLUSION**

We’ve seen that traditional ethical theory has done a poor job of representing women’s moral viewpoint. Aristotle saw female virtue as subservience, and Rousseau emphasized the need of women to be sexually appealing to men. Wollstonecraft argued that morality is gender neutral, drawing on human rationality that men and women both share. Gilligan argued that women have a special capacity to care for others, and this translates into a female value of care, a key component of which is particularization. Noddings sees the care value as a virtue, and Miller as a duty, but both of these are compatible. We’ve concluded that the best way of resolving tensions between the gender-related differences in ethics is for men and women to adopt both the male and female approaches to morality.

             Having said all this, however, we still could be clearer about what the female value is that we should internalize. The care value is currently the best option on the table, but that has only been around for a few decades, and there’s no telling what else might be proposed when there are more reliable studies on psychological gender differences. In the meantime, we might make a best guess. It would help if we had a female version of the golden rule that quickly captures the uniquely female moral perspective, yet at the same time shows its relation to traditional ethics. Perhaps something like this: “Treat others as friends in need, without violating principles of justice.” By treating others as friends in need, we incorporate the female care value and its emphasis on particularization. By not violating principles of justice, we are acknowledging the validity and constraints of the traditional rules of morality. While our initial stance toward others should be one of intimate caring, lurking in the background is the set of moral rules that we have learned from our youth onward that guards against unjust conduct. Justice is an especially good representative of traditional morality since it holds a central place in virtually all ethical theories—whether the theory is virtue-based, social contractarian, Kantian, utilitarian, or a dozen other approaches. The emphasis on justice also sends a clear message that the caring relationship we develop with others cannot be unfairly preferential. It is one thing to develop a special relationship with others, but it is entirely different if it turns into nepotism, favoritism, partiality, and other types of unfairness. A balance is needed between close relationships and impartiality, otherwise caring could devolve into tribalism or a good ol’ boy’s club, where we become overly loyal with the caring friendships that we cultivate.

**READING 1: MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT ON WOMEN AND MORALITY**

**Changes in Social Attitude Needed regarding Women**

. . . Contending for the rights of women, my main argument is built on this simple principle, that if she be not prepared by education to become the companion of man, she will stop the progress of knowledge, for truth must be common to all, or it will be inefficacious with respect to its influence on general practice. And how can woman be expected to co-operate, unless she know why she ought to be virtuous? Unless freedom strengthen her reason till she comprehend her duty, and see in what manner it is connected with her real good? If children are to be educated to understand the true principle of patriotism, their mother must be a patriot; and the love of mankind, from which an orderly train of virtues spring, can only be produced by considering the moral and civil interest of mankind; but the education and situation of woman, at present, shuts her out from such investigations.

             In this work I have produced many arguments, which to me were conclusive, to prove, that the prevailing notion respecting a sexual character was subversive of morality, and I have contended, that to render the human body and mind more perfect, chastity must more universally prevail, and that chastity will never be respected in the male world till the person of a woman is not, as it were, idolized when little virtue or sense embellish it with the grand traces of mental beauty, or the interesting simplicity of affection. . . .

             Consider, I address you as a legislator, whether, when men contend for their freedom, and to be allowed to judge for themselves, respecting their own happiness, it be not inconsistent and unjust to subjugate women, even though you firmly believe that you are acting in the manner best calculated to promote their happiness? Who made man the exclusive judge, if woman partake with him the gift of reason?

             In this style, argue tyrants of every denomination from the weak king to the weak father of a family; they are all eager to crush reason; yet always assert that they usurp its throne only to be useful. Do you not act a similar part, when you _force_ all women, by denying them civil and political rights, to remain immured in their families groping in the dark? For surely, sir, you will not assert, that a duty can be binding which is not founded on reason? If, indeed, this be their destination, arguments may be drawn from reason; and thus augustly supported, the more understanding women acquire, the more they will be attached to their duty, comprehending it, for unless they comprehend it, unless their morals be fixed on the same immutable principles as those of man, no authority can make them discharge it in a virtuous manner. They may be convenient slaves, but slavery will have its constant effect, degrading the master and the abject dependent.

**Against Rousseau’s view of Female Coquetry**

Let us examine this question. Rousseau declares, that a woman should never, for a moment feel herself independent, that she should be governed by fear to exercise her _natural_ cunning, and made a coquettish [i.e., flirty] slave in order to render her a more alluring object of desire, a _sweeter_ companion to man, whenever he chooses to relax himself. He carries the arguments, which he pretends to draw from the indications of nature, still further, and insinuates that truth and fortitude the corner stones of all human virtue, shall be cultivated with certain restrictions, because with respect to the female character, obedience is the grand lesson which ought to be impressed with unrelenting rigor.

             What nonsense! When will a great man arise with sufficient strength of mind to puff away the fumes which pride and sensuality have thus spread over the subject! If women are by nature inferior to men, their virtues must be the same in quality, if not in degree, or virtue is a relative idea; consequently, their conduct should be founded on the same principles, and have the same aim.

             Connected with man as daughters, wives, and mothers, their moral character may be estimated by their manner of fulfilling those simple duties; but the end, the grand end of their exertions should be to unfold their own faculties, and acquire the dignity of conscious virtue. They may try to render their road pleasant; but ought never to forget, in common with man, that life yields not the felicity which can satisfy an immortal soul. I do not mean to insinuate, that either sex should be so lost, in abstract reflections or distant views, as to forget the affections and duties that lie before them, and are, in truth, the means appointed to produce the fruit of life; on the contrary, I would warmly recommend them, even while I assert, that they afford most satisfaction when they are considered in their true subordinate light.

             Probably the prevailing opinion, that woman was created for man, may have taken its rise from Moses's poetical story; yet, as very few it is presumed, who have bestowed any serious thought on the subject, ever supposed that Eve was, literally speaking, one of Adam's ribs, the deduction must be allowed to fall to the ground; or, only be so far admitted as it proves that man, from the remotest antiquity, found it convenient to exert his strength to subjugate his companion, and his invention to show that she ought to have her neck bent under the yoke; because she as well as the brute creation, was created to do his pleasure. . . .

             To speak disrespectfully of love is, I know, high treason against sentiment and fine feelings; but I wish to speak the simple language of truth, and rather to address the head than the heart. . . . Youth is the season for love in both sexes; but in those days of thoughtless enjoyment, provision should be made for the more important years of life, when reflection takes place of sensation. But Rousseau, and most of the male writers who have followed his steps, have warmly inculcated that the whole tendency of female education ought to be directed to one point to render them pleasing.

**Playing with Dolls no proof of Natural Coquettishness**

As for Rousseau's remarks, which have since been echoed by several writers, that they have naturally, that is from their birth, independent of education, a fondness for dolls, dressing, and talking, they are so puerile as not to merit a serious refutation. That a girl, condemned to sit for hours together listening to the idle chat of weak nurses or to attend at her mother's toilet, will endeavor to join the conversation, is, indeed very natural; and that she will imitate her mother or aunts, and amuse herself by adorning her lifeless doll, as they do in dressing her, poor innocent babe! is undoubtedly a most natural consequence. For men of the greatest abilities have seldom had sufficient strength to rise above the surrounding atmosphere; and, if the page of genius has always been blurred by the prejudices of the age, some allowance should be made for a sex, who, like kings, always see things through a false medium.

             In this manner may the fondness for dress, conspicuous in women, be easily accounted for, without supposing it the result of a desire to please the sex on which they are dependent. The absurdity, in short, of supposing that a girl is naturally a coquette, and that a desire connected with the impulse of nature to propagate the species, should appear even before an improper education has, by heating the imagination, called it forth prematurely, is so unphilosophical, that such a sagacious observer as Rousseau would not have adopted it, if he had not been accustomed to make reason give way to his desire of singularity, and truth to a favorite paradox. . . .

             I have, probably, had an opportunity of observing more girls in their infancy than J. J. Rousseau. I can recollect my own feelings, and I have looked steadily around me; yet, so far from coinciding with him in opinion respecting the first dawn of the female character, I will venture to affirm, that a girl, whose spirits have not been damped by inactivity, or innocence tainted by false shame, will always be a romp, and the doll will never excite attention unless confinement allows her no alternative. Girls and boys, in short, would play harmless together, if the distinction of sex was not inculcated long before nature makes any difference. I will, go further, and affirm, as an indisputable fact, that most of the women, in the circle of my observation, who have acted like rational creatures, or shown any vigor of intellect, have accidentally been allowed to run wild, as some of the elegant formers of the fair sex would insinuate.

             The baneful consequences which flow from inattention to health during infancy, and youth, extend further than is supposed, dependence of body naturally produces dependence of mind; and how can she be a good wife or mother, the greater part of whose time is employed to guard against or endure sickness; nor can it be expected, that a woman will resolutely endeavor to strengthen her constitution and abstain from enervating indulgences, if artificial notions of beauty, and false descriptions of sensibility, have been early entangled with her motives of action. Most men are sometimes obliged to bear with bodily inconveniences, and to endure, occasionally, the inclemency of the elements; but genteel women are, literally speaking, slaves to their bodies, and glory in their subjection. . . .

             Women are everywhere in this deplorable state; for, in order to preserve their innocence, as ignorance is courteously termed, truth is hidden from them, and they are made to assume an artificial character before their faculties have acquired any strength. Taught from their infancy, that beauty is woman's scepter, the mind shapes itself to the body, and, roaming round its gilt cage, only seeks to adorn its prison. Men have various employments and pursuits which engage their attention, and give a character to the opening mind; but women, confined to one, and having their thoughts constantly directed to the most insignificant part of themselves, seldom extend their views beyond the triumph of the hour. But was their understanding once emancipated from the slavery to which the pride and sensuality of man and their short sighted desire, like that of dominion in tyrants, of present sway, has subjected them, we should probably read of their weaknesses with surprise. . . .

**Moral Virtues and Duties the Same for Men and Women**

I wish to sum up what I have said in a few words, for I here throw down my gauntlet, and deny the existence of sexual virtues, not excepting modesty. For man and woman, truth, if I understand the meaning of the word, must be the same; yet the fanciful female character, so prettily drawn by poets and novelists, demanding the sacrifice of truth and sincerity, virtue becomes a relative idea, having no other foundation than utility, and of that utility men pretend arbitrarily to judge, shaping it to their own convenience.

             Women, I allow, may have different duties to fulfill; but they are _human_ duties, and the principles that should regulate the discharge of them, I sturdily maintain, must be the same.

             To become respectable, the exercise of their understanding is necessary, there is no other foundation for independence of character; I mean explicitly to say, that they must only bow to the authority of reason, instead of being the _modest_ slaves of opinion.

**Early Association of Ideas Negatively Impacts Female Character**

Educated in the enervating [i.e., exhausting] style recommended by the writers on whom I have been animadverting; and not having a chance, from their subordinate state in society, to recover their lost ground, is it surprising that women everywhere appear a defect in nature? Is it surprising, when we consider what a determinate effect an early association of ideas has on the character, that they neglect their understandings, and turn all their attention to their persons? . . .

             Everything that they see or hear serves to fix impressions, call forth emotions, and associate ideas, that give a sexual character to the mind. False notions of beauty and delicacy stop the growth of their limbs and produce a sickly soreness, rather than delicacy of organs; and thus weakened by being employed in unfolding instead of examining the first associations, forced on them by every surrounding object, how can they attain the vigor necessary to enable them to throw off their factitious character?—where find strength to recur to reason and rise superior to a system of oppression, that blasts the fair promises of spring? This cruel association of ideas, which everything conspires to twist into all their habits of thinking, or, to speak with more precision, of feeling, receives new force when they begin to act a little for themselves; for they then perceive, that it is only through their address to excite emotions in men, that pleasure and power are to be obtained. Besides, all the books professedly written for their instruction, which make the first impression on their minds, all inculcate the same opinions. Educated in worse than Egyptian bondage, it is unreasonable, as well as cruel, to upbraid them with faults that can scarcely be avoided, unless a degree of native vigor be supposed, that falls to the lot of very few amongst mankind.

Henry Sidgwick, _Methods of Ethics_ (1874), Bk. 3, Ch. 2. Sidgwick states that, while duties and virtues are commonly associated, there are some virtues that are not connected with duties. Also, William Leslie Davidson writes, “Virtue and Duty are words commonly employed as synonymous; so that moralists speak indifferently of a ‘classification of _virtues_’ and a ‘classification of _duties_,’ ” The _Logic of Definition_ (1885), p. 196.
